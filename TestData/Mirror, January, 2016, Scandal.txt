Findus are not keepers; 
Frozen food brand to disappear

BYLINE: STEPHEN HAYWARD

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 23

LENGTH: 237 words

FINDUS is being frozen out after 57 years as a UK favourite.
All products by the freezer food brand will vanish from shops in the spring - including its iconic Crispy Pancakes. 
The treat, launched in the 1970s, was named our favourite retro food in 2009 - with three times the votes of nearest rivals Wagon Wheels and Fab lollies.
But owner Young's Seafood is dropping the Findus brand after it was caught up in the 2013 horse meat scandal.
The move will leave a sour taste for lifelong fans including Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, who created a smoked haddock crispy pancake on his Channel 4 show River Cottage. And as Crispy Pancakes topped the RETRO ICON Crispy 2009 poll, Findus chiefs let the celebrity chef add a lobster thermidor filling to the range. He said at the time: "My heroes were Captain Birdseye and Mr Findus. I loved nothing more than Crispy Pancakes."
Findus recalled products three years ago after some of its beef lasagnes were found to be 100 per cent horse meat.
Young's Seafood is expected to launch Chef 's Classic lasagne and spaghetti bolognese later this year. And devotees of Crispy Pancakes, currently on sale at Asda and Morrisons, need not despair - a new version will launch under the Original Pancake Co brand.
Findus, first sold in Sweden in 1945, debuted in the UK in 1958 and in 2011 global sales topped £1billion. Young's Seafood declined to comment on the changes.

TAX-ROW giant Google has landed a lucrative deal to help the HMRC collect TAXES.
The internet firm was brought in by Revenue and Customs while haggling over its £130million bill.
Its HMRC role came as thousands of Revenue jobs face the axe and Chancellor George Osborne tries to clamp down on tax avoidance.

NET PROFIT; 
CORPORATE MONSTER COSY WITH REVENUE Kerching! Google signs deal to pay just £130million in unpaid tax Kerching! Internet giant lands bumper contract for job at HMRC EXCLUSIVE

BYLINE: STEPHEN HAYWARD; PHIL CARDY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 4,5

LENGTH: 622 words

FURIOUS MPs and unions last night demanded an investigation after it emerged tax-row giant Google had landed a plum deal working for the Revenue.
Calls for an explanation came as thousands of job losses are threatened at the very HMRC offices where Google gear will be rolled out.
More than 100 HMRC offices are due to be replaced with 13 regional bases. 
And critics pointed out the deal came as tax staff desperately tried to clamp down on corporate dodgers - and while Google was negotiating to pay £130million in unpaid tax.
Google made an arrangement last summer with HMRC to provide office services such as Google Apps and Google Docs to speed up communication between staff and make the tax-gathering operation more efficient.
The internet giant's services will "streamline" tax collection under an existing IT contract between HMRC and data processing firm Capgemini UK.
Details have not been disclosed but the deal is expected to run into millions of pounds.
HMRC's move will mean some documents are held on the internet company's offshore servers.
Critics have accused the search engine giant of shifting billions of pounds worth of profit generated in the UK to low-tax Ireland. HMRC's own staff vented their anger about close ties with Google amid claims the firm is getting special treatment. The issue was raised on Friday at a meeting in Wrexham, where up to 350 HMRC workers in the city face losing their jobs.
Some staff are being relocated to Cardiff or Liverpool, but the majority will lose their jobs.
The meeting at Wrexham university was attended by local MP Ian Lucas plus union and HMRC officials.
One ex-civil servant said: "It highlighted just how cosy the HMRC is with Google. It's wrong they paid so little tax and then on the other hand you see they have these government contracts.
CONCERN
"The issue was raised to show that HMRC staff face losing their jobs in Wrexham while Google appears to be getting away with not paying a fair amount of tax."
Labour MP Mr Lucas said: "The Government needs to come clean and be open about its relationship with Google. There is great concern about the tax it paid. I will be calling for an investigation into the relationship between Google and the Treasury and whether the tax settlement is in any way connected with HMRC cuts."
It is further embarrassment for the Government just days after Google's so-called "sweetheart" deal to pay the backdated £130million in UK tax was mocked as "derisory" by Labour. The Commercial and Public Services Union said: "If the Tories keep cutting HMRC's staff and budgets we'll never tackle tax evasion. We'll just see scandal after scandal.
"It would be a gravely serious matter if it turned out HMRC was soft on Google because of its closeness to the company."
Chancellor George Osborne has pledged to crack down on corporate tax dodging but has been ridiculed for doing too little too late.
Labour MP John Mann said: "There is a huge irony that Google are providing services to HMRC when the Government is reducing precisely the people investigating Google. It is hardly surprising the Treasury have come to a cosy relationship with Google. It's a case of I'll scratch your back and you scratch mine."
A spokesman for the HMRC said: "HMRC does not have a contract with Google. Licences for Google products are provided through our existing IT contracts."
It said new software will give "greater flexibility and efficiency, while reducing costs". In a statement, it added: "Following a successful pilot, we plan to roll out Google tools to more people. We've carefully considered protection of customer information and this remains our priority." Google could not comment on the "standard contract".

Taxman's too friendly with giant

SECTION: EDITORIAL; OPINION; LEADING ARTICLES; Pg. 14

LENGTH: 222 words

THE scandal of Google's tax deal gets worse and worse.
It was bad enough that the internet giant paid virtually nothing despite making vast profits. And that it took six years to get them to pay more. And that the amount they finally agreed to pay was a tiny proportion of their UK earnings. 
Now we learn that, despite all the difficulties the Inland Revenue had with them for so long, it was employing Google on a major www.project.No wonder they thought they could get away with anything.
When David Cameron was challenged at Prime Minister's Questions over the sweetheart deal which allows Google to pay a mere 3 per cent tax, he said this was nothing to do with the Government.
It was entirely the responsibility of HM Revenue and Customs, which is an independent organisation, he insisted.
Even if we believed ministers didn't interfere - despite holding 17 meetings with the firm's bosses - just how independent could HMRC have been when it was hiring an organisation it was negotiating with over a major tax bill? Millions of ordinary workers and hundreds of thousands of small firms know the Revenue as an unsympathetic, remorseless pursuer which does no one any favours.
Except, it appears, for the huge firms which come to a special arrangement.
Google will make millions from the work it is doing for HMRC. We hope it pays tax on it.

THE accusations of a sex abuse cover-up and allegations of lying to a Dail committee are of the gravest nature. 
It has been claimed that attention was drawn to cases of abuse at the a HSE foster home in the mid-1990s but they were not followed up.
There are also allegations the senior HSE staff set out to deceive members of the Public Accounts Committee over an apology supposedly given to one of the alleged victims. Health service chief Tony O'Brien must answer these questions when he meets with members of the PAC on Tuesday.
In a statement last night junior health minister Kathleen Lynch "serious consideration" must be given before any decision is made about establishing a Commission of Inquiry.
She said no inquiry should be made before a report by Senior Counsel Conor Dignam is published who was reviewing other reports into the allegations.
It has also emerged that a Garda investigation, which has been ongoing since 2010, is preventing the publication of these two reports.
This is the same old story of one investigation preventing another from taking place with the end result that the facts never emerge.
There has been some debate as to whether or not Ireland is the best little country in the world to do business but there is no disputing the country among the worst countries in the world for sex abuse scandals.

I was Googled by a boy who my daughter fancied & he found racy photos. He was embarrassed.. but complimentary!; 
The Jump STAR TINA HOBLEY ON BEING A HOT MUM EXCLUSIVE

BYLINE: ROD McPHEE

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 30,31

LENGTH: 1136 words

She set pulses racing as flirty nurse Chrissie Williams, one of Holby City's most popular and longest serving characters. And, at the age of 44, devoted wife and parent Tina Hobley has lost none of that sex appeal... which can be awkward for her eldest daughter.
Isabella, 16, was particularly red-faced when a lad she fancied checked out some of Tina's saucier shots online.
"There was one boy she was quite keen on and he'd Googled me and, of course, these pictures came up," says Tina.
"They were a bit racy. Then Isabella gets really embarrassed because she has to introduce him to me. 
"I remember her telling me that he looked me up and said something like: 'Oh your mum looks very...' Well, let's just say he was very complimentary.
"I did meet him in the end actually. He was charming and slightly embarrassed I think. But I'm not embarrassed. My daughter knows it's just what Mummy does. And I don't regret anything.
"But I do look back and wonder why I did them. It was because someone, somewhere put me in front of a camera and told me to do those pictures. I'm quite a good girl so I do what I'm told to do."
The mother-of-three will be going from risque to risky in the new series of The Jump, which starts tomorrow night.
Tina will take on a string of icy challenges in the Austrian Alps alongside 11 other celebrities. Her husband, PR director Oliver Wheeler, is flying out with their kids to show their support.
Once, Tina and Oli used to sneak away for a week and could enjoy being a couple. Now the kids go everywhere with them, is stealing those private moments more difficult?
"No, it's easy. How does anyone cope? You just find ways," she says. "Having our anniversary week away gave us a break from the kids but now they know what we're up to. They've clicked on to our little secret.
"The kids want to come with us now and they're so much fun we want to be with them all the time anyway."
Tina split from her first husband and Isabella's father, graphic designer Steve Wallington, in 2001, after three years of marriage. She wed Oli five years later and had two more children, Olivia, seven, and five-yeaold Orson. This year is the couple's 10th anniversary.
"It has been 10 amazing years and he's fantastic," she says. "The secret? Marry your best friend, respect one another and let each other grow and change."
Tina has had a substantial career change in recent years. After 12 years on BBC hospital drama Holby City sh decided to pursue a greater range of roles and TV work. But she admits it is harder now she is in her 40s because younger women still get the best jobs, particularly in her line of work.
She says: "I did a play last year, Dead Simple, where I was about 10 years older than my character was supposed to be. But luckily the producers didn't mind that, probably because I was on stage.
"But if that was television - and I know they are making a TV version - I wouldn't be playing the girlfriend in that story. I'd be playing the ex-wife or something like that.
"They don't write as many roles for older women as they write for 20-something www.girls.TV shows like Doctor Foster don't come along very often."
She stops short of branding it ageist or sexist but Tina sounds irritated by the barriers older actresses face.
"It's been there for ever and we're not going to change it overnight," she says. "You'll quite happily cast a 50-year-old man with a 29-year-old girl but you wouldn't do it the other way around.
"But then that's life as well. There are lots of older men with younger women. It's unusual to see it the other way around so I suppose they're just writing about real life."
On the plus side, Tina still has the good looks casting agents crave. But she insists she doesn't have to work hard to stay in shape, even though, as an actress, there is pressure to look her best.
She says: "I'm not worried about that.
If you start chasing everything and trying to keep up with it... I'd stop living. I love the acting but it's only one part of my life, not all of it."
Tina, who was born and raised in North London, played home-wrecking barmaid Samantha Failsworth in Coronation Street in 1996. It was one of her first acting jobs after drama school.
In 1999 she starred opposite Nick Berry, playing WPC Melanie Rush on BBC drama Harbour Lights and had a small role on ITV's The Bill. She landed her career defining role on Holby in 2001, aged 29.
While on the Beeb drama, her character had a string of affairs with married medics, became pregnant after a one-night stand and fell in love with a gay doctor. Tina eventually quit the show in 2013 but there were no hard feelings. "I had my kids all the way through Holby and the BBC was incredibly supportive," she says.
"But you can't do anything else when you work for those big shows, and I didn't get into acting to do just one role.
"It was 12 years and I felt like I did all the storylines I could possibly do around a bed. I just wanted to shake things up and do as many things as possible."
Part of her post-Holby career change is The Jump. Now in its third series, the Channel 4 show challenges a dozen famous faces to compete in various winter sports, ranging from the bobsleigh to speed skating.
After each round a celebrity is eliminated by taking on the live air jump. "It's very dangerous," Tina says. "It's proper extreme. But I'm not worried about getting injured, I could get injured crossing the road, though I wouldn't want to get injured early so I miss any of the events.
"This is an incredible opportunity and I want to make the most of it."
Tina has also had the chance to spend six weeks' training in the Alps with an eclectic collection of fellow stars.
Celebs taking part this time are Made In Chelsea's Mark-Francis Vandelli, socialite Tamara Beckwith and EastEnders Sid Owen and Louisa Lytton. Pop stars Sarah Harding and Brian McFadden, sporting greats Linford Christie, Beth Tweddle and Rebecca Adlington, and James "Arg" Argent, just about complete the line-up.
But the celebrity Tina sounds most excited about is US star Dean Cain, 49, best known for his role in 1990s hit series Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman. Tina recalls: "I grew up watching him on TV. I really wanted to be Lois Lane.
"Dean is very cool. The other day my son was off school and happened to be watching Spider-Man. So I said to him: 'Do you want to speak to Superman?' then handed the phone across to Dean and they had this really long chat.
"It's a brilliant group on The Jump in general. Brian is hilarious and Linford is a real raconteur too.
"So we've been having lots of laughs, lots of singing around the fire and there has been plenty of wine flowing."
The Jump starts tomorrow night on Channel 4 at 8pm.

Murdoch Jr's return to Sky; 
Mogul's son back after hacking scandal

SECTION: FEATURES; Pg. 40

LENGTH: 262 words

THE son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch is to make a shock return as chairman of satellite giant Sky - nearly four years after quitting the firm.
James Murdoch was forced out by the phone hacking scandal that caused the closure of the News of the World. 
The Sunday newspaper was part of News Corporation, of which James was also chairman.
At the time, Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox was on the verge of taking full control of Sky.
James Murdoch's appointment has fuelled speculation that Fox, which still owns 39% of Sky, will make a new bid - rumoured at up to £14billion. Others suggest Rupert Murdoch is more interested in a US takeover deal instead.
However, the appointment was immediately slammed by one of Sky's big shareholders.
OLD JOB James Murdoch Royal London Asset Management, which owns £50million worth of Sky shares, called the move "inappropriate", as James is also chief executive of Fox.
Hamilton Claxton, from RLAM, said: "His appointment is a major concern because the chairman should be independent."
But Sky chief executive Jeremy Darroch insisted Murdoch was "without a doubt the right man for the job".
The news came as Sky revealed it signed up another 205,000 customers in the UK and Ireland in the final three months of 2015 - the biggest increase in a decade.
The rise came despite cut-throat competition from BT, which launched Champions League football coverage as part of its push into TV sport.
But Sky's takeover of sister businesses in Germany and Italy hit the bottom line. Hefty fees for doing the deals saw half-year profits drop by £12m to £524m.

The (EURO)38m Eircode question; 
COMMENT Park House, 191 - 197 North Circular Road, Dublin 7 Tel: 01 868 8600, Fax 01 868 8626, www.irishmirror.ie

SECTION: EDITORIAL; OPINION, COLUMNS; Pg. 10

LENGTH: 217 words

SERIOUS questions are rightly being asked about why the Government plunged almost (EURO)38million into the Eircode system. 
With the public still reeling from the failure of the Banking Inquiry to provide answers as to who was responsible for the financial collapse they learn of another potential scandal.
The Public Accounts Committee has disclosed this postcode system was set up with the help of three consultants who were hired without a proper, open, competitive tender.
It has also emerged one of those hired was a former ESB worker who was paid (EURO)146,000 for his work on the project as well as a former assistant secretary in the Department of Agriculture who received (EURO)158,000.
When the daily rates for some of these retirees were as much as (EURO)1,230 it is hardly surprising the project ran to (EURO)20million more than originally forecast.
This is another case of "here we go again" with retired civil and public servants being hired by other civil servants.
Deputy Patrick O'Donovan's claim that for those involved it was like "winning the Lotto" is spot on and is also right when he said "it stinks".
The mistakes of the past are being repeated by senior public servants who know they face few consequences and can look forward to huge pensions as a reward for squandering public money.

1,200 deaths, filthy conditions, women abused... Unite boss' undercover visit reveals Qatar migrant workers' misery; 
WE EXPOSE SHAM ME OF 2022 WORLD CUP HOST NATION

BYLINE: KEVIN MAGUIRE

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 30,31

LENGTH: 1075 words

ENTERING through an unguarded entrance to the concrete complex, before being led down a corridor littered with shoes outside doors, we are guided into a small room.
Crammed inside are eight bunks - the limit is supposed to be four - as well as migrant workers' clothes, possessions, food and cooking utensils.
With no table or chairs in the overcrowded, squalid rooms, labourers are forced to eat meals on their beds. 
This is reality for many of those working to get Qatar ready for the 2022 World Cup.
Unite leader Len McCluskey is on a secret, after-dark trip to the labour camp in Al Khor, north of the capital Doha, to see the diabolic conditions for himself and speak to the workers.
They complain through an interpreter about low pay and long hours.
All say their passports have been taken by their employers and claim they are paid less than promised when they took loans to pay an agent for work in Qatar.
"Football is a beautiful game turned ugly by the heartbreaking ill-treatment of wave after wave of workers lured to Qatar on false promises, then trapped in a living hell," says Mr McCluskey.
But now international football chiefs are to be confronted by a British coalition over the deadly exploitation of migrants.
Union boss Mr McCluskey will form a united front with MPs and campaigners after witnessing widespread abuse of migrants on his unofficial visit.
He also plans to build an alliance with the Professional Footballers' Association and supporters' clubs to demand guarantees from the five candidates to succeed disgraced Sepp Blatter as FIFA boss.
"Wages agreed in advance aren't paid and they're packed into dirty, hot, crowded rooms, with the inadequate cooking and washing areas a severe health risk because they're so dirty," says Mr McCluskey.
"Every football fan, trade unionist and anybody who cares about decency must protest loudly because we can't stand by and look the other way, letting these workers be tortured like this."
One of the workers refuses to take any money before running to a shop to buy a cool bottle of cola for the delegation, which included Labour MPs Ian Lavery and Naz Shah.
"They are forced to live in a dump but their spirit and pride isn't broken," says union chief Mr McCluskey.
"I wish I could make company bosses, Qatari rulers and the British ambassador see the grim reality. It's shameful."
Qatar is the world's richest country per head, thanks to its vast supply of oil and natural gas, but is subject to strict Islamic law.
Criticising its ruler, the Emir, is illegal while crimes such as adultery and drinking alcohol are punishable by flogging.
Its mistreatment of migrant workers, many from South Asia, adds to the controversy over the World Cup going to a country so hot the matches will have to be played in winter.
Two years ago the Mirror exposed how more than 1,200 workers had died in a construction boom, leading Qatar to announce reforms. Roads, hotels, shopping malls and offices, including infrastructure linked to the World Cup, were a killing zone. Some workers reported that bosses were flouting laws that allow workers to take breaks in sweltering temperatures.
The 250,000 Qatari nationals are vastly outnumbered by 1.8 million migrant workers flown in from India, Nepal, Pakistan, Bangladesh and the Philippines to work in the building and services industries.
But the Mirror found they were paid as little as £120 a month for grafting six days a week.
One worker says he was forbidden to go home after his father had died. And a group of young Filipino women claim their bosses subjected them to humiliating abuse.
The Qataris are keen to stress conditions are better on World Cup stadiums such as the showpiece Khalifa in Doha. But in Al Khor, home to thousands of migrant workers in other roles, conditions certainly haven't improved two years on.
The dirty, sprawling complex houses 50,000 workers, packed eight or 10 to a room, with few facilities for washing, cleaning and cooking. The doors on the toilets have no locks. Another camp has just one toilet for every 60 people, while a new "Labour City" built for workers in capital Doha resembles a prison with its towering perimeter walls.
One labourer on £160 a month shows a photograph on his phone of a worker crushed to death by a road roller.
"We were told by the police it was none of our business," he says. "They moved us away and told us to say nothing, threatening to send us back to Bangladesh."
A group of Filipino waitresses explains how they were forced to work 16 hours a day. After their restaurant shifts, 27 of them were crammed in a 13-seater van and taken to do cleaning jobs.
The women, packed 10 to a room in a house and required to buy their own mattresses, worked in large, Western hotel chains and absconded when they couldn't stand the abuse any longer.
"The Egyptian manager would slap our faces, spit into our faces, if we didn't move fast enough or complained," one claims. "We paid $1,000 [£700] to come here and were promised $400 [£280] as waitresses. We received $275 [£190] a month and made to clean, work in shops, babysit.
"The heat in summer was too much, 50C. We couldn't bear it so agreed together to leave without permission."
The group is taking legal action with the support of the Philippine embassy.
Trade unions are banned in Qatar, where the kafala system gives bosses huge control over workers who must secure permission to switch jobs or leave the kingdom.
Mr McCluskey and two MPs on the delegation, arranged by Building Workers' International, met with the British ambassador in Doha.
The Unite leader said the British Government felt the Qataris were "frightened" of unions but the ambassador expressed willingness to look at grievances.
Labour frontbencher Mr Lavery said: "These people are being treated like animals and the appalling wages and conditions trap them in a nightmare.
"The migrants want to work and aren't afraid of hard work. Most of those I spoke to want to stay in Qatar. But they want the money they were promised and to be put in rooms fit for human habitation."
Fellow Labour MP Ms Shah, who represents Bradford West, criticised the Pakistani and Bangladeshi governments for refusing to publish numbers of their nationals dying in Qatar.
The Muslim politician said: "When national governments stand up for their people, the Qataris will be forced to treat them better. While they keep quiet, the Qataris aren't going to change."

MEN TARGETED IN FACEBOOK SEX SCAM; 
SOCIAL MEDIA SHOCKER Gardai issue warning about X-rated blackmail plot It's extortion, these men are innocent, please be careful... - INSPECTOR LUKE CONLON

BYLINE: PAT FLANAGAN

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1,5

LENGTH: 465 words

MEN are being blackmailed in a Facebook sex sting, it emerged last night.
Two victims, one a teenager, contacted gardai over the Eastern European scam.
The female fraudsters lured the men into having webcam sex but recorded them performing sex acts. The women then threatened to post the clips on their Facebook pages so family, friends and possible partners could see the X-rated footage. 
The pair were told they had nothing to worry about if they handed over (EURO)200 to (EURO)300, but once that was paid, the women demanded more cash.
Gardai in the Bruff district of Limerick confirmed they are investigating two reports of blackmail by women the men met through Facebook.
Inspector Luke Conlon described it as "insidious" and "a totally new phenomenon".
He said: "It is extortion.
We want to make people aware that these things are happening and to warn them about the dangers.
"The person is a completely innocent victim.
"It isn't alone happening here, it is happening around the country.
"I would say there are an awful lot of incidents not being reported out of embarrassment by the person.
"This is a new phenomenon with social media and improved technology - most of the computers have cameras built into them.
"You think you are safe in your own castle and then something like this happens."
His simple advice is if you don't know who you are talking to on Facebook - don't do anything foolish.
The scam starts with an attractive female, usually from Eastern Europe, sending a friend request to a Facebook user. The man accepts and they begin a relationship online.
Webcams are used so they can see each other and over time the liaison develops.
The woman then videos, over the internet, the person she has befriended in a state of undress or performing a sexual act while they both engage in intimate behaviour.
A message is then sent demanding a sum of money or the video of him will be posted for everyone to see.
However, once the first payment is received they often look for more money.
A caller to the Neil Prendeville Show on REDFM earlier this month told how he was asked to pay (EURO)5,000.
The single man told her he would not care if she released the footage, and said he laughed off her attempted extortion.
He rang the popular talk show to alert others of this scam.
The man said: "She didn't catch me but she will catch someone. Even if it's one person, that's five grand."
If you have been affected by this scam you are asked to report it to gardai in complete confidentiality.
Insp Conlon also urged parents to speak to their children about the dangers of social networking sites.
He said: "They should not be engaging with people if they don't know who they are.

13 HOURS: THE SECRET SOLDIERS OF BENGHAZI
Cert 15, Running time 144mins ***
The mercenaries who protected American diplomats from terrorists are given the Michael Bay treatment in a movie both exciting and exhilarating before it all becomes a bit exasperating.
Much like gung-ho US-vs-them flicks such as Black Hawk Down, Act Of Valor or The Kingdom, the director has taken a true story of survival and re-imagined it as a Call Of Duty video game. Visceral and energetic it may be, but thoughtful and intelligent it most certainly is not. 
The setting is the streets of newly liberated, post-Gaddafi Libya where, in 2012, six private security guards are flown in to protect a US diplomatic outpost which soon comes under attack on the anniversary of 9/11.
Having fought off the Jihadists, the soldiers of fortune race through the streets of Benghazi to a CIA base to defend the US ambassador and his staff from a fresh wave of small arms fire. All the while, requests for air support are denied. With lead slamming into trucks, RPGs levelling buildings and mortars exploding, this is safe territory for Bay who, as we learned from his four Transformers movies, knows how to create a spectacle.
Told from street level, the film is a dizzying mix of shaky camera work and hyperactive editing where we're never more than a few minutes from something blowing up or someone being mown down. In fact, the body count is so high and the bad guys so relentless, it's like watching World War Z, with extremists standing in for zombies. But amid such action, Bay squanders the opportunity to meaningfully question the role of private security firms working in the Middle East or query the politics of the War on Terror, aside from a few off-the-cuff one liners.
Just as jarring is the lack of characterisation of the contractors, save to say they're all bearded patriots with loving families at home who, via Skype, tell them how much they're missed.
It all makes for a ferocious but flawed film - but I'd certainly buy the video game.

THE 33
Cert 12A, Running time 127mins
**
The extraordinary story of the rescue of 33 miners trapped in a Chilean mine makes for a deeply ordinary movie that would be more at home as a Channel 5 matinee.
The special effects may be thrilling to behold but the story - starring Antonio Banderas and Juliette Binoche - is formulaic and cornily told. While Spotlight (see above) is an object lesson in how to tell a true story, here's the polar opposite.
Despite fears their gold and copper FORMULAIC Cornily told mine is dangerously unsafe, miners head 2,300ft under the Atacama Desert where, as we all know, a series of cave-ins leave them stranded.
Above ground, rescuers battle against the clock to locate and somehow bring the men out alive. The problem isn't that we all know how it ends. It's that the journey there - with its emphasis on the strength of the human spirit - is laid on with a shovel, complete with endless group hugs and a score that has all the subtlety of a jackhammer.
YOUTH
Cert 15, Running time 124mins
***
Here Michael Caine gives his best performance in years as a curmudgeonly composer in an otherwise unremarkable arthouse effort.
Youth is director Paolo Sorrentino's second film in the English language and, while it's as visually impressive as his last movie - Oscar-winning The Great Beauty - it is one that's easier to admire than to actually enjoy.
The setting is a Swiss health farm whose guests include a fraught film director (Harvey Keitel), a cynical actor (Paul Dano), a retired composer (Caine) and his daughter, played by Rachel Weisz. Also dropping in is an actress (Jane Fonda), a Miss Universe and, in a couple of jarring cameos, singer Paloma Faith and even Argentinian footballing legend Diego Maradona.
Its theme of growing old, memories and regrets of the past are poignant and engaging, but there's not one character here that anyone will be able to relate to.
Still, Caine is on fire, but has been cruelly overlooked by awards committees.
DIRTY GRANDPA
Cert 15, Running time 102mins
***
Robert De Niro's latest lowbrow comedy is being called the worst film of the year - presumably by people who haven't seen Ride Along 2. It may be lewd, crude and in shockingly bad taste, but I defy you not to snort with laughter at least a dozen times.
De Niro plays a badly behaved widower being driven down to Florida by his grandson (Zac Efron). While the lad is a straight-laced lawyer about to marry the boss's daughter, his elderly relative is a foul-mouthed boozer intent on bedding a younger woman.
The story - borrowing elements from Jackass's Bad Grandpa and The Hangover series - is lazy and predictable, while the humour's very much of the lowest common denominator variety, but De Niro's devil-may-care performance with Efron as his foil is a hoot.

A neutered probe from the outset

BYLINE: PAT FLANAGAN

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 5

LENGTH: 310 words

THIS is supposed to be a comment on the Banking Inquiry but it's not really, for there was no real banking inquiry.
What we got yesterday was two years of wasted time and the results can only be measured in the number of trees needlessly pulped to produce the 375-page document. 
In effect it was an anti-inquiry as it was set up in such a way it was impossible to name, never mind hold to account, the people responsible for one of the greatest banking disasters in world history.
Imagine an inquiry into the police which couldn't name officers and you get the idea. This is a banking inquiry without any bankers being named.
Five million euro of taxpayers money and the inquiry informs us the banking collapse was "the cumulative result of a series of events and decisions over a number a years".No one named, no one blamed, no one shamed and that's what was intended.
Labour Senator Susan O'Keeffe's claim that "we were never going to be able to make findings of fact against individuals" is akin to a eunuch explaining why he's employed in a harem.
She and the others on the committee of castratos were there because they could never rise to the task in hand.
There is little in the report that was not already known although there was some light shone on the ECB's rule in lumbering the Irish people with the debts of private banks.
We know the taxpayer was forced by these financial fascists to hand over (EURO)9billion to the bondholders but we are never to know their names of those who got our "Bond Aid".
The then ECB president Jean Claude Trichet was determined we would pay but we can never find out if those who benefitted from our billions were his friends.
The banking inquiry was an Irish solution to an Irish scandal.
Everyone is sorry but not sorry enough to hand back their huge pensions and everyone goes back to the golf course instead of going to jail.

THE RESTORATION MAN
C4, 9pm
There's something rather enthralling about watching people take on a massive, complicated, sometimes ridiculous project. Especially when they're novices. And especially when you can do it from the smug comfort of a stable, fully-standing house, complete with four walls and a roof.
But you will still be cheering them along, hoping they can achieve the impossible.
Our guide in this series is dashing architect George Clarke, who likes to help rescue neglected treasures across Britain.
In this episode, amateurs (hurray!) Mark Hinchcliffe and Laura Rushton have hatched a plan to turn two beautiful but crumbling church buildings into luxury family homes in Harrogate.
The project hangs on them successfully transforming the listed Sunday school building, built in 1896, as all the profits from its sale are needed to turn the cavernous Victorian church into their own home. And there's also a chapel next door to think about.
It's a stunning conversion, and they have the skills to get the job done, but can they keep up their high standards as the hidden costs of modernisation start to spiral?
For them, it's a labour of love, that's for sure...
DRAMA

As she admires her ring by the firelight, romantic thoughts flitting through her brain, you'll be screaming "Noooo! Don't do it!" As this brilliant Victorian soap opera continues apace, Amelia dashes straight down to the dress shop to tell her best mate Honoria the news.
"So you've decided to treat yourself to a new dress? Well magenta is all the rage in Paris," says Honoria. "Maybe something a little lighter," teases Amelia, "perhaps white?"
Of course, Honoria feels slightly sick with envy since she's about to be married off to the old and fat (and rich) Sir Lester. And who can blame her?
But as it happens, Honoria is right that Amelia shouldn't rush things with Compeyson.
"You think he considers the Havisham fortune the real prize and not me?"sulks Amelia. Well, durrr...
Elsewhere, Bucket is running out of reasons to keep Fagin in prison, and Mrs Gamp finally realises she may have overstayed her welcome with Silas.
Trouble & strife
THE GOOD WIFE
MORE4, 9pm
THERE'S more girl power (and dodgy suits) from Alicia Florrick as she takes on the legal world in this US drama, all the while sticking two fingers up at philandering ex-husband Peter.
At the end of the last series, Alicia ( Julianna Margulies) was caught up in a voting scandal and pulled out of the race for State's Attorney.
Meanwhile, Peter (played by Chris Noth) casually announced: "I'm running for Vice President!" As you do.
Season seven kicks off with Canning (Michael J Fox) still trying, and failing, to woo Alicia.
"I don't want to work with you," Alicia tells him after he kidnaps her for dinner. "Why not?" he asks. "You're the devil," she says. Well there's a conversation stopper if ever there was one.
But the problem is, no one wants to give her a job. She's trying to revive her failing career by working in bond court - representing some rather unsavoury blokes who need bail - but the judge won't give her the time of day.
She needs to get attorney Lucca Quinn (British actress Cush Jumbo) on side, but Alicia's never been the best at making friends.
Meanwhile, back at home, Saint Grace is playing secretary, trying to further her mum's career and gain personal clients. So she's delighted when a woman turns up with an inheritance dispute over an £8 million Chagall painting.
It's just a shame Alicia's up against Diane and David, who plan to go for the jugular.
And elsewhere, as Peter launches his VP campaign, he fires Eli (Alan Cumming), who is seething with rage. "Whatever happened to loyalty?" he spits.
But Eli soon comes up with the sweetest revenge of all. He plans to set his sights on Alicia instead... but will she be game? g Pick of the day Ja

RBS sale hit by drop in shares; 
Mis-selling scandal rocks Chancellor's plan

SECTION: FEATURES; OPINION COLUMN; Pg. 42

LENGTH: 306 words

GEORGE Osborne's hopes of selling Royal Bank of Scotland suffered a setback yesterday as it revealed another £3.6billion of costs.
The sum included £2bn for two different mis-selling scandals. 
The lender, still 73% owned by the taxpayer, warned it would result in a loss for the eighth year in a row.
The latest blow will make it even harder for the Chancellor to flog the Government's stake in RBS, as planned, over the course of this Parliament.
Osborne kicked off the process last August by flogging a 5.4% chunk at a £1bn loss. He gambled on making a profit in subsequent sell-offs by triggering a jump in the bank's share price.
But a stock-market meltdown since has seen RBS's shares plunge, dropping to 255p after yesterday's update - half the 502p break-even price when taxpayers bailed out the bank at the height of the financial crisis.
Chris Beauchamp, a senior market analyst at City firm IG said: "Any further sales are essentially off the table."
City commentator David Buik added: "I doubt it will be sold for two years."
The £3.6bn of costs announced yesterday included an extra £1.5bn towards the expected bill for the alleged mis-selling of mortgage-backed wheelerdealing in the US prior to 2008. Another £500million was set aside for the payment protection insurance scandal here, taking its bill to £4.3bn.
RBS is also speeding up plans to plug a £4.2bn hole in its pension fund for 220,000 workers, resulting in an initial £1.6bn accounting charge.
RBS boss Ross McEwan confirmed it would announce another annual loss next month, after it plunged £3.5bn into the red for 2014. He added: "I am determined to put the issues of the past behind us and make sure RBS is a stronger, safer bank."
David Hillman, Robin Hood Tax campaign spokesperson, said: "Try as it might, the banking sector is incapable of shaking off its past sins."

Santander feels true cost of PPI

The ongoing payment protection insurance scandal cost banking giant Santander £450million last year.
The extra money set aside for compensating victims meant profits fell 4.1% to £1.3billion.
Excluding the provision, UK profits jumped 20% to £1.8bn.
Santander and RBS are the first UK banks to reveal the latest hit from the ongoing PPI scandal, with reports that industry bill could jump by £5bn.
Santander's Spanish parent, Banco Santander, saw annual profits rise 12.5% to £8.3bn.
The results come just months after the bank hiked the fees on its popular 123 current account to £60 a year.

During a recent episode of the popular daytime TV series, a man mocked the 50-year-old about his wife's alleged infidelity last year.
Kyle told Good Morning Britain: "If you put yourself out there and stick your head above the parapet and you have an opinion, you'd be pretty stupid to say that it's never gonna happen.
"I dignified it by listening to what he had to say and moving on because my private life is my private life, and my kids are what sustains me and what it's all about.

Rio ban plea over Russian dope scandal

LENGTH: 120 words

RUSSIA should be banned from the Rio Olympics over its athletes' doping scandal, the chairman of UK Athletics told MPs yesterday. 
Ed Warner also called for British drugs cheats to be barred from representing their country if caught.
Giving evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, he said: "The benefits of long-term performance-enhancing drugs exist for a very long time, for years."
He also wants a register showing when UK athletes are tested for drugs. But UK Anti-Doping chief Nicole Sapstead rejected the idea, saying "wrong inferences" could be drawn.
Governing body IAAF has suspended Russia from competitions following claims last November by the World Anti-Doping Agency of "state-sponsored doping".

Code breach rap for Tesco; 
Suppliers waited years to be paid

BYLINE: RUKI SAYID

SECTION: FEATURES; Pg. 44

LENGTH: 344 words

TESCO ripped-off suppliers to make its own profits look good, a watchdog has found.
Supermarket Czar Christine Tacon yesterday hammered Britain's biggest supermarket for the underhand tactic of delaying payments that "seriously breached" a legally binding code of conduct. 
But it escaped a multi-million pound fine as her power to impose a hefty financial penalty was only granted after her investigation into Tesco's dodgy practices was launched.
In an 11-month probe, which examined documents from June 2013 to February 2015, Tacon - the Groceries Code Adjudicator (GCA) - uncovered a culture of Tesco bullying suppliers, charging them twice for money they owed, yet refusing to pay them on time. In one case, a supplier owed millions was forced to wait more than two years before the chain coughed up.
Tacon said the supermarket was slavishly driven by profit margin targets and rode roughshod over suppliers to meet them.
"I was troubled to see Tesco at times prioritising its own finances over treating suppliers fairly," she said.
"The most shocking thing in the investigation was how widespread the company's behaviour was. Practically every supplier I spoke with had evidence of delays in payment."
The investigation came in the wake of an accounting scandal into a £326million black hole in the company's books, which is in the hands of the Serious Fraud Office.
Tacon has ordered Tesco to clean up its act and laid down a fivepoint plan that includes a ban on Tesco making "unilateral deductions from money owed for goods supplied" and retraining finance teams and buyers.
Tesco boss Dave Lewis apologised to suppliers and said he has overhauled practices and changed the focus to customer service over targets for margins. He said the supermarket had implemented 14 changes above the 84-page report's recommendations and added: "Tesco is a very different business to the one the report refers to."
But the supermarket faces more turmoil as shareholders are planning a £100m damages claim over the accounting scandal in which Tesco admitted it had overstated profits

Ex-Tory MP Knight headed industry body the British Bankers' Association from 2007 to 2012 when the Libor and PPI scandals erupted.
After leaving in 2012 she took another highly paid post lobbying for the Big Six energy firms. She will now advise Mr Osborne on how to simplify the tax system.

Top Tories met Google execs 25 times in run-up to sweetheart tax deal; 
SCANDAL OVER MULTINATIONAL FIRMS Fury at cosy meetings before cut-price payoff Labour slams special terms for Osborne chums EXCLUSIVE

BYLINE: JACK BLANCHARD

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 4,5

LENGTH: 753 words

THE fury over Google's cut-price tax deal with HMRC last night intensified as it was revealed Tory ministers had been cosying up to bosses at the internet giant during the talks.
George Osborne, policy chief Oliver Letwin and ex-chairman Grant Shapps were among 17 who held meetings with executives at the multi-billion firm in the run-up to the "sweetheart deal".
The cushy arrangement with the Treasury allows Google, which has been outspoken against government internet snooping plans, to pay backdated taxes of just £130million for the past 10 years and a future rate estimated at 3% of its vast profits. 
That is in contrast to the 20% corporation tax paid by small businesses. And it emerged yesterday France is negotiating a tax deal with Google worth three times as much.
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, writing in today's Mirror, said: "We can't have mates' rates when it comes to taxes. But that's what Osborne's cosy deals are offering to giant firms.
"Government should be there to stand up to the corporate giants, not cuddle up to them."
Labour MP John Mann added: "It is outrageous that such sweetheart deals are being agreed. This looks very much like lobbying for tax rebates."
Colleague Angela Smith said: "British taxpayers pay their dues, so should companies like Google." Even some of Mr Osborne's colleagues turned on the Chancellor after he laughingly hailed the tax deal a "major success".
Senior Tory backbencher David Davis said: "HMRC has 101 different measures that are punitive for small businesses or normal citizens, but not companies like Google. You shouldn't allow big businesses to negotiate a lower tax rate because they create jobs. Corner shops could not do that, so why should they?"
Tory London Mayor Boris Johnson dismissed the deal as "derisory" and Downing Street distanced itself from Mr Osborne's boasts. The Mirror has ascertained that ministers held at least 25 official meetings with Google in the 19 months between January 2014 and September 2015, as the firm negotiated with HMRC. Data for the last six months has yet to be published.
Other senior Tories who held talks with Google included Home Secretary Theresa May, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Business Secretary Sajid Javid.
There is no suggestion any rules were broken, and it is understood the meetings covered a broad range of topics.
But the talks held every three to four weeks over such a long period raise fresh questions about the close links between the Tories and the US tech giant. The party lavished £312,000 on Google ads in the run-up the election. Labour spent just £371. Chairman Eric Schmidt spent five years as a business adviser to the PM. He previously gave the keynote speech at the Tory conference - where he was introduced by Mr Osborne.
Mr Cameron has twice spoken at Google's conferences. He accepted a £14,000 trip to its HQ in 2007 and met with bosses three times after becoming PM. His former chief of staff Steve Hilton is married to a Google exec. CCHQ spin doctor Amy Fisher is a former press officer at the firm, while MP Nigel Huddleston only quit his job there in May.
Mr Osborne faced a storm of criticism over the tax deal. But the PM's spokesman denied there was any split with the Chancellor. He insisted: "There is no difference in the position. This is a good deal." But Number 10 tried to shift responsibility for the deal on to the taxman. It said: "No ministers were involved. It is done by HMRC."
Revenue tax director Jim Harra defended the deal. He said: "We have collected the amount of tax that is due under the law."
It is rumoured to be negotiating similar deals with other major firms including Facebook, Amazon and Starbucks.

The Tax Justice Network says the firm should be paying £200million a year in the UK, not £130million for a decade's back taxes.
And critics reckon taxes on profits should be paid where the business takes place, rather than where the firm is "domiciled", which Google has been doing.
The Diverted Profits Tax (or "Google Tax") which came in last year will mean when you sell web adverts in Britain, you can't book the sale in Dublin, Amsterdam or the British Virgin Islands.

DON'T GIVE LATE LATE SHOW LAMB THE CHOP; 
Animal rights group calls for TV shocker's Dynamo to be saved

BYLINE: ADELINA CAMPOS

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 7

LENGTH: 446 words

A WELFARE rights group has called for a lamb that appeared on a controversial segment of the Late Late Show to be saved from the dinner table.
Animal Rights Action Network yesterday wanted Dynamo's life to be spared, as well as his sibling and mum, after they helped to highlight a tagging system last Friday. 
John Carmody from the charity said: "ARAN may not see eye to eye with some farmers, but we hope in this case we can meet and come to an agreement to save the lives of the two lambs and their mother, before they end up on someone's dinner plate in the coming weeks."
Host Ryan Tubridy defended the show which showed an invention simplifying the process. The presenter insisted while the carousel contraption might have seemed "odd" to city dwellers, it was viewed differently by those in the rural community. His remarks come as dozens of viewers took to social media to criticise the show for featuring entrepreneur TJ Gormley of Cormac Tagging demonstrating how the device works.
Speaking on RTE Radio One, Tubridy commented: "Visually it certainly was very odd looking to city, urban types.
"If you're from a farming background the feeling would have been that's how it works.
"In fact if you spend your time on your hands and knees chasing lambs around it's very difficult to try and tag them and care for the lamb a humane way."
Ear To The Ground presenter Darragh McCullough also pointed out the animal didn't seem to be in any pain. The farmer, who was speaking yesterday on RTE 2fm, said: "To most farming folk out there what happened on the show looked pretty OK.
"The lamb wasn't struggling, the farmer in me went, 'that's a pretty good gadget.' "I spent plenty of days trying to tag calves and lambs and pin them down, and there's nothing more distressing for an animal and for the farmer than a squirming animal.
"If you want to avoid scandals like foot and mouth and BSE and you want traceability in your food, you have to have a system, there is no other way around this."
Meanwhile, actress Rachel Pilkington who is a vegetarian, revealed she was "upset by" the segment.
She added: "People have been very protected from the reality and suddenly you're sitting in on a Friday night to watch an entertainment programme and it's there in front of you.
"If people had that aversion to it there is something they can do, they can withdraw support for any industries which exploit or profit from the use of animals."
The Late Late Show posted a photo on Twitter of Dynamo, adding he was "in great form" after his appearance.

No10 FAILS TO BACK OSBORNE GOOGLE BOAST

BYLINE: JACK BLANCHARD

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 2

LENGTH: 321 words

FURIOUS Tories have turned on George Osborne over his "sweetheart" tax deal with Google. The Chancellor was hung out to dry by his own backbenchers yesterday as they savaged the agreement to let Google pay just £130million in back taxes for the past decade - despite raking in £4billion every year in sales. 
Wycombe's Tory MP Steve Baker labelled it "derisory", while fellow backbencher, Ealing North MP Steve Pound, branded it "unsatisfactory".
Mayor of London Boris Johnson said: "Everyone is complaining that it isn't enough, that it still amounts to a tax rate of only about 2% on earnings."
Even David Cameron tried to distance himself from the agreement, which was lauded by Mr Osborne as a "great victory" at the weekend following a six-year inquiry by HM Revenue and Customs. Downing Street refused to back the Chancellor, saying only that the deal was a "step forward".
Under pressure Mr Osborne refused to attend an urgent House of Commons debate on the scandal called by Labour yesterday, sending junior Treasury Minister David Gauke in his place.
Mr Gauke denied Google will be paying a tax rate of less than 3% on its profits but he refused to reveal the true figure, saying: "The position is because of taxpayer confidentiality."
Labour MPs said the deal was hypocritical at a time when the Tories are clamping down on small businesses.
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said: "It is important everyone is treated equally and fairly, whether they be a large multibillion-pound corporation or a small business."
Ilford North MP Wes Streeting said: "Constituents filing their tax returns don't have the luxury of negotiating their own sweetheart deals."
And Scunthorpe MP Nic Dakin said that it comes as the Tories refuse to support the UK's ailing steel industry.
He said: "Why is the Government so supportive of sweetheart deals for companies like Google, but so slow to act on the steel industry?" jack.blanchard@mirror.co.uk

Sam Cam: If kids say oink, oink try not to get in a fight; 
Advice to her children over 'pig-gate'

BYLINE: TOMY BRYANT

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 7

LENGTH: 262 words

SAMANTHA Cameron warned her children they could be the butt of playground jokes after their dad was embroiled in the pig-gate scandal.
David Cameron's wife told Nancy, 12, Arthur, nine, and five-year-old Florence they could expect some "oinking" over claims about the PM and a dead animal when he was a student at Oxford. 
She mentioned the advice to Jason Manford when they appeared on The Great Sport Relief Bake-Off together just a week after the shocking pig allegations were made by former Tory donor Lord Ashcroft, the comedian revealed.
Jason told listeners on his Absolute Radio show he was chatting to her and thought "I'm just gonna mention it". He added: "I asked, 'Has it been all right this week at home?' Quite a strange conversation to be having with the PM's wife.
"She told me, 'Yeah, I just said to the kids that you might get a few oink oink noises at school but just try not to fight with anybody.' I thought, 'That is good parenting advice.'" Jason said the conversation "really endeared her more to me".
He added: "You can probably guess from my accent that I didn't vote for her husband but I'm surprised they don't roll her out more. She's charming and just lovely, really nice, really chatty. She did very well on Bake-Off. She was very good. She's obviously got a nice kitchen."
Mrs Cameron stars alongside a host of celebs on the Sport Relief show including Will Young, Louise Redknapp, Alison Steadman and television journalist John Simpson.
The pig-gate claims, which the PM denies, were made in Lord Ashcroft's book Call Me Dave.

A hero to Tories... a missing dad to girl he wouldn't love; 
Cecil Parkinson dies of cancer at 84

BYLINE: JASON BEATTIE

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 22

LENGTH: 455 words

LORD Parkinson, described by allies as a "towering Conservative" but reviled by others for his shameful refusal to acknowledge his daughter from a 12-year affair, has died at 84. 
A key architect of Margaret Thatcher's 1983 election victory, he was tipped to become the next party leader until his spectacular fall from grace.
Although one of Thatcher's "golden boys", even she was unable to keep him on board after he got secretary Sara Keays pregnant, before trying to force her to have an abortion and subsequently refusing to have anything to do with daughter Flora.
When she turned 18 in 2002, Flora said she had never met her father.
She said: "I would like to see him. If he loved me, he would want to see me and be in my everyday life.
"I think my father has behaved very badly towards me. I feel jealous that my mother has known him but I haven't, and jealous of other people who go on holiday with their fathers, when I don't."
Prime Minister David Cameron said he was "deeply saddened" by Parkinson's death and added: "He was one of the towering Conservative figures in the 1980s.
"He was the first big political figure I worked for and I will never forget his kind words of support and encouragement."
But Parkinson will be remembered by most as a controversial figure.
When news of his affair broke, he fought to stay in post but quit after it emerged Ms Keays was pregnant. In her 1985 memoir A Question of Judgement, serialised in the Daily Mirror, she claimed he had "begged" her to have an abortion and that he had "haggled over every pound" of child support - an accusation he contested.
Parkinson also took out a court injunction that forbade Flora, who was left severely disabled by a brain tumour, from speaking publicly until she was 18 or doing anything that might identify her.
This meant she was never photographed alongside classmates or allowed to take part in school activities.
Sara once said his vow never to see his daughter was "the one promise to me he ever kept, I'm afraid".
Former Tory Cabinet minister Michael Portillo said the Keays scandal had "definitely held back his career".
Lancashire-born Parkinson was a successful businessman before being elected as an MP in 1970.
He was talent-spotted by Thatcher who promoted him from Paymaster General to Party General in 1983.
Correspondence between the pair shows she continued to support him after his resignation and she brought him back as Energy Secretary in 1987 before he briefly became Transport Secretary.
In 1992 he was made a peer and in 1997 returned as party chairman.
Parkinson, who was married to Ann since 1957, had three other children Mary, Emma and Joanna. A family statement said he lost his cancer battle on January 22.

It's moving day for Ashley and Laurel, but disaster strikes when she falls off a ladder. Then there's a bigger shock when Emma checks her blood pressure and suggests Laurel might be pregnant. She descends into a panic about how she would cope with a baby as well as Ashley's illness.
Meanwhile, Paddy is alarmed by Marlon's interest in Tess and warns him off, telling him she's a married woman. Slightly hypocritical. And elsewhere, Vanessa suggests Kirin takes paternity leave.

Kush arranges a surprise birthday party for Shabnam, forcing her to paint a smile on. Just what she doesn't need.
She tells Kush she's fed up with questions about Stacey and leaves. Later at the hospital, Shabs tells Martin they need to find a mum and baby unit for Stacey and Arthur.
Elsewhere, Nancy and Whitney have a massive fight over a decision made at The Vic. And a drunken Phil makes a fool of himself... again.
DOCUMENTARY
THE MAD WORLD OF DONALD TRUMP
C4, 9pm
To say presidential hopeful Donald Trump has courted controversy would be the understatement of the century.
The multi-billionaire tycoon, 69, has been embroiled in a number of scandals after making disparaging comments about women, such as calling one a "fat pig" and another "extremely unattractive".
Not to mention the fact he plans to ban Muslims from entering America and wants to build a wall across the Mexican border. But most worrying of all?
Trump is leading the polls for the Republican nomination.
Yes, the celebrity businessman has built an army of fervent fans in America, while us Brits are just watching him bewildered from across the pond.
In this documentary, reporter Matt Frei hits the Trump campaign trail, speaking to the supporters, critics and those who have personally dealt with him - such as former Scottish leader Alex Salmond (who says he now regrets supporting Trump's luxury golf resort plan), and broadcaster Selina Scott, who accuses him of being "extremely abusive".
"What's amazing is that people genuinely believe Donald Trump is the guy who is going to save their country," says Matt.
But can 'The Donald', as he is known, really make it all the way to the White House?
REALITY
THE REAL MARIGOLD HOTEL
BBC2, 9pm
In the movie The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, an eccentric bunch of pensioners, played by Judi Dench, Bill Nighy and Maggie Smith, skipped off to India looking for a happy retirement.
And here, eight famous senior citizens do the same thing for this show - all waxing lyrical about spending their golden years there.
"I would love it - a different way of life and a warm climate," raves dancer Wayne Sleep.
And although I don't believe the intention is serious - it's more a travel documentary - this is an amusing take on the norm. Arriving at their private mansion in Jaipur are Wayne, 67, chef Rosemary Shrager, 65, darts champ Bobby George, 70, gameshow host Roy Walker, 75, ex-Doctor Who Sylvester McCoy, 72, actress Miriam Margolyes, 74, singer Patti Boulaye, 61, and former newsreader Jan Leeming, 74.
And they are immediately thrown into the realities of living in India - chaotic roads, animals wandering in the street and hole-in-the-ground toilets - not to mention the heat.
And some are finding it tricky to live with their travelling companions.
"I'm not sharing my Vegemite," insists Miriam.
Will it be a challenge too far?
Sweet nothings
SUGAR FREE FARM
ITV, 8pm
SIX famous faces go cold turkey, giving up sugar for two whole weeks, in this fascinating, sometimes scary, sometimes hilarious, dietary experiment. It should come with a warning: Do not try this at home!
But if you've ever contemplated shunning the sweet stuff, it's certainly better to see how it plays out on a bunch of celebs first, right? Here are the rules: No cakes, no biscuits, no fizzy drinks, no processed foods, no fatty foods, no alcohol ("I'm sorry, what?").
The guinea pigs are definitely bemused by the extremely long list given to them at their new country farm residence.
Embarking on the radical regime are Loose Woman Jane McDonald, comedian Rory McGrath, Chaser Mark Labbett, ex-Coronation Street actress Tupele Dorgu, TOWIE's James 'Arg' Argent, and dancer and actress Jennifer Ellison.
And at first they are all rather cheerful, toasting each other as they tuck into a 'last supper' of yummy treats. This is because they have no idea what's coming.
The next meal is a green smoothie (you know the sort, probably has kale in it), presented by their on-site nutritionist Angelique Panagos, AKA the mean lady who frisks them for chocolate.
"It tastes like soil," says Jane, as everyone's smiles start slipping.
From then on, it's like watching the gradual breakdown of the human mind, body and spirit as the detox takes its toll and they start dropping like flies.
Jennifer takes to her bed with a whopping headache (the medic is called) and Jane feels sick.
"You think your body should be saying thank you," says Jane.
"But all mine is saying is 'Get me a Mars bar'."
As morale plummets, Angelique bangs on about reaching the "promised land".
But I'm fairly sure they just want to punch her in the face and head to the nearest pub...

SEB COE'S hopes of stopping the rot in athletics have suffered yet another blow with the sport's biggest sponsor terminating its relationship. 
Adidas has pulled the plug on its 11-year deal, worth £23million, with four years still to run, according to the BBC.
They claim the decision has been taken as a direct result of the doping scandal and will cost the sport tens of millions of dollars.
Adidas are said to have informed the IAAF of its intentions in November. The move is a savage indictment of the state of athletics, given Adidas remains crisis-hit FIFA's oldest commercial partner.
Olympic medallist Kelly Sotherton tweeted: "I suppose corruption within #fifa is ok according to #adidas."

OSBORNE QUIZ OVER GOOGLE TAX SCANDAL

BYLINE: JACK BLANCHARD

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 2

LENGTH: 197 words

GEORGE Osborne faces being hauled to the Commons today as fury grows over his "sweetheart" tax deal with Google. 
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell will table an urgent question over the backdoor deal to let Google pay just £130million in back taxes for the past 10 years, and an estimated 3% rate on future profits.
If Mr McDonnell gets the go-ahead from Commons Speaker John Bercow, Osborne will face an hour-long grilling from MPs this afternoon.
Mr McDonnell said if his opposite number didn't explain the deal to Parliament "we will drag him there kicking and screaming". He added: "He should be ashamed that the person cleaning his office pays a higher effective tax rate than a big firm making profits of £35billion in this country."
Google's financial structure means cash is channelled through Ireland and Amsterdam to a tax haven in Bermuda.
Meg Hillier, chair of the Commons public accounts committee, vowed to summon Google and HM Revenue and Customs for a grilling on the "cosy deal", which was unveiled on Saturday.
The Chancellor has claimed the agreement is a "major success". It understood HMRC is preparing similar ones with other corporate giants.

ROMAN'S KEEN ON DIDI MAN; 
OLD BOYS FOR BLUES EXCLUSIVE

BYLINE: STEVE STAMMERS

SECTION: SPORT; Pg. 52,46

LENGTH: 273 words

DIDIER DESCHAMPS has emerged as a shock contender to be the next Chelsea manager.
The France coach, who will lead the host nation into this summer's Euros, is under contract until the 2018 World Cup in Russia. 
Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich is determined to appoint a new boss who can offer a long-term strategy.
The Russian billionaire has been forced to bring in short-term managers like Guus Hiddink, Rafa Benitez and Avram Grant in recent seasons. Abramovich wants no more quick-fix solutions and is consulting his trusted advisor Marina Granovskaia and technical director Michael Emenalo to find the right man.
Deschamps, 47, is under consideration and has been joined on the shortlist by Mark Hughes (above). The Frenchman also speaks good English, played for Chelsea for one season in 2000. He had an illustrious playing career as part of the France team that won the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000.
But it is his impact as a coach that makes him attractive. He guided Monaco to the French title in his first season as boss. He won promotion in his first season with Juventus in the wake of the match-fixing scandal. Then, in his most successful reign, he led Marseille to instant success by winning the title in 2010.
Hughes, 52, is another Chelsea old boy. He has transformed Stoke since his arrival at the Britannia.
He has changed the club's philosophy to become a passing team with more creative players like Xherdan Shaqiri, Bojan Krkic and Marko Arnautovic.
The Welshman also had successful spells at Blackburn and Fulham and was on the Chelsea radar before he took over at Manchester City where he signed, among others, Vincent Kompany.

Alarm as banks 'wipe out emails to prevent spying'

BYLINE: KEIR MUDIE

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 24

LENGTH: 216 words

BANKERS are using special software to keep their communications secret, a leading Tory MP claims.
Instant messaging and emails can be deleted without a trace. 
And MP Andrew Bridgen fears if there is another banking scandal authorities will have no evidence to investigate. Mr Bridgen, chairman of the Regulatory Reform Select Committee, wants a clampdown on the Symphony interbank software.
He raised concerns over developer's claims it could "prevent government spying, guarantee data deletion is permanent" and help address the risk of "billions of dollars in fines".
Mr Bridgen, who believes some UK banks use the software, said: "If there are no records then there will never be another banking scandal because we'll never be able to prove it.
"The marketing is scary and sets alarm bells ringing. It suggests to me the only culture change in banking is that they don't want to get caught."
He wants Britain to follow US authorities which ordered Symphony to keep records of four big banks for seven years. Treasury Minister Harriet Baldwin has asked the Financial Conduct Authority to investigate.
Symphony was launched with £40million in 2014 by a consortium headed by Goldman Sachs and including JP Morgan, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank.
It is now believed to be worth in the region of £600million.

JEREMY Corbyn yesterday slammed the taxman's £130million "sweetheart tax deal" with Google.
The Labour leader said: "It doesn't sound enough. I have a large degree of scepticism when a multinational company comes to a voluntary agreement with the Treasury. 
"If you or I owe tax it would just be collected. When Google owes tax a voluntary agreement is reached."
Google turns over £4.6billion in the UK alone.
Shadow chancellor John McDonnell branded the amount, which covers tax backdated to 2005, "derisory". But the firm's Europe boss Matt Brittin said: "We want to ensure that we pay the right amount of tax."

NHS's £28bn bill for botched ops; 
Negligence costs rocket by 70% EXCLUSIVE

BYLINE: ANDREW GREGORY; WINNIE AGBONLAHOR

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 2

LENGTH: 315 words

THE NHS believes it will need £28.3billion to cover damages for botched care over the next few years.
The vast estimate, which has risen 70% in five years, comes as the NHS is trying to make savings of £30billion. 
It includes £12.3billion for outstanding claims and £16billion for claims expected over the next five years and beyond.
We can reveal the figure after studying the NHS Litigation Authority's accounts for 2014/15.
The Patients Association said the rise showed that hospital trusts "are not learning from their mistakes".
But Shadow Health Minister Justin Madders MP said the figures point to the decline of the NHS under Tory Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt. He urged ministers to take action to improve safety in hospitals.
Ruth Braddock, 59, whose daughter Danielle Stretton died in December 2014 aged 24 following a missed diagnosis of kidney failure at Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre, called the sum is truly shocking. Mrs Braddock said she and Danielle had found hospital staff to be "overstretched, working for hours without a break" and said that "if they are that tired, they are going to make mistakes".
The litigation authority cites several reasons for rocketing costs, including a rise in the number treated.
Over five years to April 2015, NHS England paid out £437.5million for 3,507 deaths; £29.5million on cases involving items left in people after surgery, £12.8million on cases in which doctors operated on the wrong part and £35.7million on compensation for pressure sores.
The Department of Health insisted: "Safety is our priority. It is why we have invested in thousands of new staff after the tragedy of Mid-Staffs."
The Stafford Hospital scandal centred on sky-high death rates at the hospital in the late-2000s.

AUSTRALIANS have been shocked by the latest racing scandal to hit its shores and Aussies aren't the type to be shocked easily - apart from the ones who come over here expecting it to be sunny. 
Two of the country's best-known and most successful racehorse trainers have been banned from racing for a total of seven years.
Mark Kavanagh and Danny O'Brien have made millions from the sport but that is where their similarities to me end.
Drugs tests by Racing Victoria (not Pendleton) revealed the presence of cobalt chloride in a number of horses trained by both men.
Cobalt chloride makes the horses think they are less tired than they really are but the side effects can be extremely dangerous to them.
There must be zero tolerance to drugs in horseracing and the only way to enforce this is to dish out lifetime bans to anyone caught flouting the rules.

THANKS to uncle Oscar it's time to catch up on all the realistic stories Hollywood has been telling during the past year.
Like The Martian, in which an American stranded on Mars survives for months by "making" water, growing potatoes and listening to disco music before finding a piece of NASA machinery that can hurl him back into space where his passing mates pick him up. It's called keeping it real, guys.
The Best Picture category does not totally comprise stories plucked from a Ronnie Reagan wet dream though. There's Spotlight, the story of how Boston journalists exposed paedophile priests, and the film I hope wins, The Big Short, which is a superb, biting attack on the banking crash. 
This is how it summarises the man-made disaster that has affected all of us since 2008: "Five trillion dollars in pensions, real estate, savings and bonds disappeared. Eight million people lost their jobs and six million their homes. And that was just the USA. Banks took the money the American people gave them, used it to pay themselves huge bonuses, lobbied Congress to kill big reform then blamed immigrants and poor people. And only one single banker went to jail. Some poor schmuck from Credit Suisse."
It's a timely film. What with news sneaking out during New Year hangovers that George Osborne was ceasing all inquiries into banking malpractices.
How, instead of seeking justice for the British taxpayer, Osborne held more than 90 meetings with top bankers since becoming Chancellor, pecking them on the cheek as they left his revolving door with goodie bags full of tax cuts and lighter controls.
Funny, isn't it, how our government is happy to see a disgraced banker given a Golden Goodbye while a lifelong steelworker gets a Wooden Tata? As we head for another global crash, bamboozled by the same language that we were back in '08, those bankers are poised to fill their boots again, speculating, hedging their bets, letting stocks fall so they can buy and then profit, while our pensions and savings get hammered, company profits shrink, jobs go, houses are repossessed, pay drops. And, as they say in The Big Short, immigrants and the poor take the rap.
Not that this looming global crash should interfere much with the five-star shindig taking place in Davos right now as the planet's rich elite gather to swap notes. Because all evidence points to them hitting the jackpot as inequality soars.
Less than 1% of the wealth created since 2000 has gone to the poorest 50% of the world's population.
Last year in Britain, FTSE 100 chief executives earned more than 180 times as much as the average worker. Yet for most of the past 15 years, during which there has been the worst crash since the 1920s, those companies have been less valuable than they were at the turn of the century. Go figure.
An Oxfam report this week showed that if you put the world's richest 62 people on a coach, that coach would have more wealth riding in it than the poorest 3.6 billion on earth.
In 2010 the figure was 388, meaning if the inequality carries on at the same rate, in five years you could seat the world's richest 11 on a minibus and they would be wealthier than half the planet.
And in a decade's time that number will have fallen to two. They could be lifted on to a gold-plated speedboat. Leaving four billion people drowning in their slipstream, the last noises they hear being champagne corks and laughter.
What a wonderful world.
Less than 1% of the wealth created since 2000 went to poorest 50%

SOLD DOWN THE RIVER; 
CAMERON'S BETRAYAL OF BRITAIN'S STEEL Tories to use cheap imports to build Royal Navy ships EXCLUSIVE

BYLINE: BEN GLAZE

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 4,5

LENGTH: 647 words

BRITAIN'S battered steel industry will be plunged deeper into crisis if the Tories build the Royal Navy's new frigates with cheap imports, experts have warned.
And revelations heartless David Cameron may snub UK firms in favour of foreign products make his pledge to "buy British" when it comes to major public projects look like yet another empty promise.
Furious union leaders rounded on the Government after Defence Minister Philip Dunne let slip steel for the fleet of Type 26 frigates could be supplied from abroad with multi-billion pound contracts - denying our own foundries the sort of vital cash that could secure their futures. 
Unite's Tony Burke branded the move a "betrayal" of staff who have worked in a proud and historic industry that was once the envy of the world.
It is still reeling from the announcement Tata will shed 1,050 jobs at its plants in Port Talbot, South Wales, Corby and Hartlepool. That is on top of the 1,200 posts it axed last year in Scunthorpe and Scotland- along with 2,200 workers fired at SSI's foundry in Redcar, Teesside.
SCANDAL
Steelworkers' union Community president Alan Coombs said: "Britain's warships should be built using British steel. The current steel crisis is a result of unfair trading by China, but this government could do a lot to help.
"Big projects like the new Type 26 frigates are the perfect opportunity for Cameron to put his money where his mouth is.
"We make some of the best steel in the world. There is no question over our ability, just over our government's willingness to support this vital industry.
"Just this week, David Cameron said he wanted a strong British steel industry, if he really meant it then he must ensure the Type 26 frigates use British steel."
Unite assistant general secretary Mr Burke added: "It would be a national scandal if British steel wasn't used to build the Navy's new frigates.
"The warm words from ministers on using British steel in major government projects would turn to dust and be nothing more than empty rhetoric."
Lib Dem leader Tim Farron accused the Tories of "utter hypocrisy". He said: "Despite the crisis, the Government is not committing to supporting UK industry by building these ships with homemade steel. This is a small announcement that would make a massive difference.
"They could say they would use British steel on British ships. They are not." Making the announcement the Tories were looking elsewhere, Mr Dunne said: "Steel is sourced by our contractors from a range of UK and international suppliers, reflecting the need to ensure a competi tive price and delivery at the required time and www.quality.No suppliers have been selected or any orders placed for the Type 26 Global Combat Ships."
But the sneaky Tories then tried to deflect blame for any future deals signed. Responding to a Freedom of Information request from the Mirror, the MoD said: "As for all major defence equipment projects, it is the responsibility of our contractors ... to buy the steel on the basis of cost, time and quality." The Mirror is campaigning to Save Our Steel, and the PM has vowed to "buy British".
But we revealed in October the Tories were spending tens of millions of pounds on Swedish steel for two defence projects worth almost £3.9billion.
We also discovered a quarter of design and manufacture contracts for the ships have gone to foreign firms. British defence giant BAE Systems is awarding sub-contracts. But only six of the eight deals worth £187.4million have gone to UK companies. MoD officials also said just seven of 13 design development agreements had been struck with British firms.
The Type 26 frigates, which can each carry 185 sailors and sail for up to 7,800 miles without refuelling, will be built on the Clyde in Scotland with work expected to begin this year. The first is due to enter service in the early 2020s.

STAN LEE'S LUCKY MAN SKY1, 9pm
WE are overrun with detective dramas at the moment as a troubled cop with a dark past solves crimes, usually with a super-keen sidekick.
But we've quite honestly never seen one like this. From the mind of Marvel genius Stan Lee, there is inevitably a comic book element that sends this series into the realms of the supernatural.
However, James Nesbitt isn't day running around in red pants or scaling walls like Spiderman or anything, but he does have an ancient, magic bracelet.
SAnd not even Luther has a magic bracelet.
Let's rewind a minute. Nesbitt is cop Harry Clayton, a compulsive gambler with huge debts.
Having been given only three days to pay it off ("a completely insane request"), he walks around with a furrowed brow giving everyone plenty of attitude. And then, of course, he heads to the casino, a beautiful woman wanders over, touches his arm with her bracelet while muttering something about luck and, before he knows it, he's winning.
"What if luck was something you could own?" she asks, before seducing him.
Harry then wakes up with the weird bangle stuck fast to his wrist.
And every time something lucky happens, there are lots of comic book noises, whooshes, whizzes and plinky-plonky music. Something strange is definitely afoot.
But being endowed with this kind of luck appears to come with a price and Harry soon finds himself caught up in a sinister crimewave that is sweeping London.
Naturally, there's also a little personal backstory. He's still in love with his ex Anna, and has a daughter Daisy. He wants his family back, but will luck alone be enough?
It's a rollicking ride through the forces of good and evil.
DOCUMENTARY
BRITAIN'S TRILLION POUND PARADISE: INSIDE CAYMAN
BBC2, 9pm
While we're all shivering half to death in the cold, there is a piece of Britain four-and-a-half thousand miles away where everyone is enjoying glorious sunshine, beaches - and no taxes.
The Cayman Islands (about the size of Bognor Regis) is well and truly British, apart from the lack of corporate or income tax. As a result of its offshore finance industry, it has one and a half trillion pounds in the bank, and there are twice as many companies as people.
So what's going on? With access to the movers and shakers of the Caribbean dependency, Jacques Peretti asks: "Is this the biggest ever scandal or is it just how the world does business?"
He meets the likes of millionaire businessman Marcus, who whizzes up in his bright red Ferrari and takes him swimming with stingrays, all the while flanked by two bikini-clad beauties, because presumably that's what you do in the Cayman Islands.
But not everyone is loaded. Duty tax on supermarket food costs British expats Paul and Paula from Manchester an absolute fortune - a packet of fish fingers is £8.50. Even Captain Birdseye isn't worth that much...
DRAMA
MR SELFRIDGE
ITV, 9pm
After his mother kicked the bucket rather quietly at the end of the last episode, Selfridge (Jeremy Piven) is a bit worse for wear.
All he wants to do is hole up in bed with annoying giggly blonde Rosie Dolly, or go out drinking.
"You're out every night and the gossip columns are full of stories," scolds disapproving daughter Violette.
"I don't need my children telling me how I should behave," he retorts.
Meanwhile, Kitty is beside herself to meet cosmetics icon Elizabeth Arden, who is opening a concession in the store. "Without her we'd all still be washing our faces with soap," Kitty declares. God forbid.
She soon finds a kindred spirit in the legendary Arden, who never wanted children, but when the businesswoman makes her an unexpected proposition, Kitty is faced with a dilemma.
Elsewhere, Grove takes a nasty fall up the stairs (yes, up), and Crabb packs him off kicking and screaming to see a nurse.
Forced to rest up at home, Grove considers retirement so he can be with his family, but there's some bad news that turns everything on its head.

MIKE CATT could return to rugby this summer as part of the Italy coaching team put together by Conor O'Shea. 
Catt (right) lost his job as England skills coach when Eddie Jones took over after the World Cup and began a managerial clear-out.
But it is thought he may team up with O'Shea, who is expected to succeed Jacques Brunel as Italy boss at the end of the season.
Former Ireland full-back O'Shea, 45, said yesterday he would not renew his Harlequins contract this summer.
Having taken the job after 'Bloodgate' scandal, O'Shea turned the club into Premiership champs in 2012. He said: "The end of the season is the right time for me to move."

Snooping on phones is so out of order

SECTION: EDITORIAL; Pg. 10

LENGTH: 201 words

FREEDOM of the press is one of the most fundamental liberties in any democratic society.
So it was deeply worrying when it emerged the Garda watchdog has been snooping on journalists' phones. 
The decision to access anyone's phone records should only be taken in the most serious situations.
If national security is at risk, for example, then arguably, it's justified.
But to snoop into the personal phone records of two journalists just doing their jobs and going about their daily lives is nothing short of chilling.
The Cabinet's decision to appoint an independent expert to assess if the current law needs to be changed is a positive step forward in this murky affair.
But the only possible finding is that this power is a step too far, and one which has to be reversed immediately.
It would have been a scandal to let GSOC decide if they are the right people to do the snooping.
The only way anyone could have any faith in the State and our freedoms is if a judge or senior legal expert makes the assessment, so the Cabinet's vote is welcome.
It is up to the Justice Minister to clear this issue up fast and reassure us all we are not living in a Big Brother state where the right to privacy can be trampled on.

Murray: I have watched some dodgy matches; 
Tennis ace hits out over fixing

BYLINE: NEIL McLEMAN; ANDY LINES

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 11

LENGTH: 254 words

ANDY Murray has been scouring replays of tennis matches in the wake of the fixing scandal, and says some points look suspicious.
The ex-Wimbledon champ, 28, said the issue had worried him for years, but that no sport was clean of cheating. 
He said: "I've heard about certain matches where something might have been going on.
"I've watched them and watched replays, and I've thought, 'That doesn't look right'.
"We as players can see if something was going wrong. I would actually like to know if there was any match I was involved in that had irregular betting patterns."
The Scot insisted he had never been approached to rig a match but admitted he was not surprised Grand Slam winners could be involved. He said: "No sports are clean of doping and none are clean of fixing... When it does happen, you want people to be found out."
On Monday, world No 1Novak Djokovic said he rejected £110,000 to throwa match in 2007. He spoke out after a probe began into unusual betting patterns involving players who under-performed.
Roger Federer, a Grand Slam winner 17 times, has called for those involved to be named.
World No 2 Murray eased into the Australian Open second round yesterday, beating Alexander Zverev in straight sets. His wife Kim, 28, is heavily pregnant and Murray said he would quit the Open to be there if she went into labour. He said: "My child is more important to me than a tennis match."

I'm the Sultan of South Wales..; 
Retired coalman Keith is 'heir'to billionaire Malaysian royal

BYLINE: RICHARD SMITH

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 6,7

LENGTH: 1099 words

AS Keith the Coal he lugged backbreaking sacks of fuel and lived in the modest South Wales bungalow he thought of as his family home.
Yet unknown to him, he was the firstborn son of a sultan living in a gilded hilltop palace thousands of miles away.
By the time Keith Williams discovered his connection to Malaysian royalty it was too late to meet his father, the 33rd Sultan of Perak, who died 32 years ago.
I wonder he'd put aside But now, having made a pilgrimage to the palace to see the Sultan's mausoleum and meet some of his wealthy relatives, he says it is like a fairy tale to him - and he is happy for it to stay that way.
Keith, 64, said: "The whole thing is a fairy story. It's like a story from a Disney film. If someone had told you this story in the caf or by the bar you'd tell them to get out." 
The retired coal merchant of Penygroes near Llanelli fears some of the family think he wants to stake his claim on their riches, far beyond anything he has known.
"It took us two-and-a-half minutes to drive around the Sultan's palace - it would take two-and-a-half seconds to drive round my place," he said.
"I'd imagine they are fabulously wealthy because they wield a lot of power.
"The Sultan of Johor is married to one of my sisters and from what I was told, his family are billionaires. The family have got to be right up there - oh God yes."
"But his only wish was to learn what he could about the dashing Malaysian prince who swept a besotted young student nurse off her feet all those years ago.
Elizabeth Rosa was a 17-year-old trainee at a children's hospital in Carshalton, Surrey, when she had a if he Iw whirlwind affair with student Idris Iskandar Al-Mutawakkil Alallahi Shah, who was studying in London.
Elizabeth fell pregnant and went home to Swansea, where she gave up her baby boy for adoption when he was four months old. Meanwhile the prince was sent back to Malaysia to avoid a scandal.
When Keith was 12 his dad, unknown to him, became the 33rd Sultan of Perak - one of nine ruling across different regions of Malaysia - and moved into the magnificent Istana Iskandariah palace in the royal town of Kuala Kangsar. There he ruled until he died from a heart attack in 1984.
Life was rather different for Keith back in Penygroes. But while lacking the splendour of the domed palaces, he grew up happily in a loving family who told him when he was 13 that he was adopted.
He left school at 15 and joined his adoptive dad's coal delivery business.
"We delivered 112lb sacks of coal to several hundred houses every week," he said. "I did that for 20-odd years and I'm suffering chronic back issues now."
It was not until much later, when he had married wife Vanessa and had a family of his own, that he began to track down his biological parents.
After two years' hard work, he finally found his birth mother in Peterborough, Cambs. She told him of her young love, and he learned his father had been the 33rd Sultan of Perak - and that he, as his oldest son, would have been the 36th.
Despite growing up with jet-black hair and dark skin, his heritage was a shock.
Keith said: "I was in my late forties when I found my mum.
"It was a shock really, a bit upsetting - to find out you are the son of a Sultan is just something you wouldn't expect. They were seeing each other regularly - it was a real love story but I don't think they ever lived together."
However, after he moved back to Malaysia she lost all contact with him.
"She had all the paperwork to do with my father," he said. "Although my mother wrote to him care of the royal palace, he never got the letters and he was never able to find her. She kept all the correspondence and everything he gave her until her death at the age of 81."
So Keith did some detective work to track him down. "After finding my mum I obviously went a step further and tried to contact my dad but it wasn't easy because of his royal connections. I discovered my dad died in 1984 and tried to get in touch with his 10 children.
"I made contact with one or two on Facebook and they could see the family resemblance from my photo - but because of the sensitivity it was all quite low profile. I didn't speak to any of them."
Keith and one son travelled to Malaysia to visit his dad's tomb and the old palace where he once lived - but they were not invited to the new palace occupied by the current 35th Sultan, who Keith believes to be a cousin. He met his half sister during his visit to Malaysia in September, when she visited him incognito at his hotel.
He had built up a rapport with one of his half brothers who died suddenly shortly before Keith's visit.
But he fears other relatives may have believed his motive was to claim his inheritance as the first born son of the former sultan.
Keith, who retired six years ago on health grounds from his job as manager of a delivery firm, said the young prince had given his mum several photos which showed him, his parents and their palace with the address written on the back. Keith said he also had a local authority document - dating from the time he was put up for adoption - which stated his father was Malaysian.
Talking of the moment he finally saw his father's resting place last year, he said: "It was fantastic but very emotional. I'd have loved to meet him - but we can all say 'I wish'. That's just the way it is.
"I know my half-brother would have given me a warm welcome and a tour of the palace, but I never got to see inside. I have a funny feeling my dad knew I existed but he was unable to contact me because my mum was a commoner.
"You ask yourself if he would have put something aside in terms of money if he knew I existed. You would have thought in that position with so much wealth he would have wanted to ensure all his children were looked after."
But he has no regrets. "That's not why I wanted to contact my dad's family," he said.
"I've worked all my life and never wanted for anything.
"I got married when I was 21 and me and Vanessa will celebrate our 43rd wedding anniversary in April.
"If I had wound up living with Malaysian royalty it would have been a totally different culture - you can't compare it and I don't look at it like that.
"My natural mother had a rough time. She was in care and her mum died of TB when she was young.
"Apparently I'm a bit of a celebrity out in Malaysia now - it's been in the papers out there."
But he is happy as he is. "I'm still Keith y Glo - Keith the Coal," he said. "It's not going to change who I am."

Players paid to throw games at Wimbledon; 
'Three cases at Championship' Djokovic reveals 2007 offer

BYLINE: ANDY LINES

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 468 words

THE probe into alleged match-fixing in tennis includes at least three cases at Wimbledon, it has emerged.
It is unclear which players are involved and current champ Novak Djokovic yesterday slammed bung-takers as he said he was once offered (EURO)143,000 to throw a game. 
The investigation into the scandal rocking tennis was sparked when researchers found suspicious betting patterns on players who then under-performed.
Gambling syndicates in Sicily, Italy and Russia are suspected of targeting top stars and at present 16 players are being probed.
Djok-ovic, 28, who is also world number one, said he felt "terrible" when he was approached in 2007. He said: "That's an act of unsportsmanship, a crime in sport. I think there is no room for it.
"I was not appr but through peop "I was not approached directly but through people working with me, with my team. We threw it away right away. It didn't even get me. There were in those times rumours, people going around. In the last six, seven years, I haven't heard anything similar."
Seven-times Wimbledon cham Roger Federer, 34, called for calm until offenders were identified. He said: "I'd love to hear names. Then it's concrete stuff and you can debate it. It's nonsense to answer something that is pure speculation.
But he added: "We need to make sure the integrity of the game is maintained. Without that, why do you watch?" In 2007, tennis authorities were allegedly handed a study on match-fixing with enough evidence to ban offenders - but did not act. The current probe comes after experts used a computer algorithm to analyse betting on 26,000 matches from 2009 to last autumn across seven bookies.
Chris Kermode, president of the Association of Tennis Professionals, said last night that the sport's authorities "absolutely reject" the suggestion that evidence of match-fixing has been suppressed.
And Nigel Willerton, director of the Tennis Integrity Unit set up in 2008, refused to confirm whether any players at the Australian Open are under investigation.
Meanwhile, Michael Franzese, a former boss in New York's Sicilian mafia, said tennis was compromised as far back as 2007 and stars fixing matches risk "blackmail, raids and even their life".
Franzese, who supervised bookmakers and athletes in the 1980s, said: "Illegal betting is the biggest business there is.
"Tennis is very predictable and very easy to fix - you only need one person. Once I hooked one, I never let him go."
A spokeswoman for Prime Minister David Cameron said: "It is deeply concerning that another sport is facing such serious allegations."

LENGTH: 113 words

KHLOE Kardashian has admitted she made a sex tape with her former husband Lamar Odom.
The 31-year-old's sister Kim first shot to fame after footage of her and her singer ex Ray J was leaked. 
But even after the scandal, Khloe seemed to have no issue with recording herself and Lamar.
Speaking on US show Watch What Happens Live on Sunday, Khloe said: "I've definitely recorded myself having sex with my ex-husband, but not like talking to camera.
"Do you remember those little cameras... they were little video cameras that you put in your pocket? "That was my jam for a moment."
When asked if she still has the recordings or destroyed them, the reality star replied: "I do. In my safe."

SCANDAL OF FAMILIES MOVED INTO SQUALOR; 
Children living among drunks and rats

BYLINE: DAVID MAHER

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 25

LENGTH: 340 words

RATS, cockroaches, bloodstained mattresses, mould and anti-social behaviour were among the things people in emergency accommodation had to put up with in 2015.
The Dublin Regional Homeless Executive received more than 100 complaints last year, with awful conditions leaving families living in fear every night. 
Papers released under the Freedom of Information Act to RTE showed health and safety, anti-social behaviour and child welfare were the chief concerns of parents d r e ts forced to take refuge in emergency hotels and B&Bs.
Many families found themselves sharing apartments with rodents, cockroaches, mites and bed bugs as well as having to contend with mould, leaky ceilings, faulty electrics and blood-stained mattresses.
Smoking, including of cannabis and heroin, late bars, locks-in and anti-social and intimidating behaviour by other residents also feature among the complaints. Other families complaints emergency hit out at their treatment by staff, including being removed with no reason given.
A nurse, who said she has seen her fair share of poor accommodation, also cited a case where two families went into the kitchen of their accommodation to make breakfast and found someone had defecated on the floor.
Dublin Simon living in emergency accommodation Community boss Sam McGuinness described the situation as "sickening." He said: "The difficulty now is because there is such a scarcity of accommodation, conditions people take accommodation in are being compromised.
"People are having great difficulty finding accommodation because the numbers looking for it have increased significantly.
"In the past year the number of families with children has doubled.
"There are now more than 700 families and 1,500 children in emergency accommodation.
"We have a serious housing issue in this city and it's spreading to the rest of the country and so far none of the initiatives have made a difference."

IT is heartbreaking to hear a working mum was forced into homelessness with her nine-year-old daughter because of the huge cost of rent. 
Erica Fleming works 29 hours a week, but the housing crisis means private accommodation is no longer an option for her.
It is senseless for the Government to place people like Erica and her daughter Emily into costly emergency accommodation when they could have simply increased the family's rent supplement.
According to Fr Peter McVerry, a long-time campaigner for the homeless, it costs the State (EURO)30,000 a year to provide someone with a room in emergency accommodation, more than five times the cost in a privately rented flat.
Not only are rooms in hotels and B&Bs costing the taxpayers a fortune, they are also wholly inadequate. It emerged last night some accommodation units are overrun with bedbugs, rats and disease-carrying pests.
Data given to RTE on the number of complaints made about the homeless scandal showed kids being placed in overcrowded hotels next door to pubs, exposed to street fighting, verbal abuse and other dangerous situations.
Erica, meanwhile, has been raising her daughter while working almost full-time and she is more than entitled to a safe home.
It's about time the Cabinet stopped kicking the bucket down the road and leaving it for the next Government to solve.

TRAGEDY When Susan Matta, 53, met old flame Stephen Keen, 54, on Friends Reunited she decided to leave her husband Francesco Matta and move to Devon with her new man. 
But in 2006, 56-year-old Francesco, right, unable to accept his marriage was over, went to their Devon home and stabbed his love rival to death. He got 13 years, six months' jail after being convicted of murder.
PAEDOPHILE PRIEST In 2008, Catholic priest Father Peter Carr, then 73, was convicted of child abuse after two women posted memories of their ordeals on the site.
The women recalled how he made them strip naked before applying make-up to their bodies between 1969 and 1975. They reported him to the police and Carr, by then a priest in Gloucester, was jailed for one year.

We are like a married couple but never row. We've got stronger over time; 
TV'S PHIL AND HOLLY SPILL SECRETS OF SUCCESS EXCLUSIVE

BYLINE: CLEMMIE MOODIE

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 14,15

LENGTH: 1363 words

THEY'RE the king and queen of daytime television.
Seven years into their reign on ITV's This Morning, Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby are still going strong and still making one another laugh, often inappropriately, on a daily basis.
Now nominated for a National Television Award at tomorrow night's ceremony - after years of regularly scooping up the prizes - we catch up with the duo for a chat about dogs, dragons, drunken mishaps and naked Fridays.
You describe yourselves as one another's TV husband and wife - does that mean you bicker like an old married couple?
Phil: I don't think we've ever had a row. Holly: It's really weird, isn't it, because the amount of time we spend with each other you'd think we would, but it just hasn't happened. We're very much on the same page with most things, we think about things in the same way, which is really helpful when you're live. I know how he's thinking and how he's going to react to things. And that's just grown stronger and better over time. 
Phil: We have never, ever bickered. Or even come close to bickering.
What's guaranteed to make one another laugh?
IPhil: We've got a very similar sense of humour, and I like attempting to set Holly off.
with Holly: I know what he's doing, because I'll feel this elbow nudging me to tip me over the edge.
and 'Phil: I think having one foot over the line is fun. I like being nicely naughty.
I'm Holly MAKING Holly: There was that time I was eating mussels with Gino [D'Acampo] and I don't like to look at them, so I closed my eyes and said, "Once it's in I'm fine"...
Phil: It is like we're all 10 sometimes.
So what is the secret to your chemistry?
Holly: It's got to be our friendship. We've known each other a long time, we've been through a lot - and not necessarily on screen but off screen as well, with babies and life. So when we come into work we talk about everything.
Phil: We also trust each other completely, so if we go out and sit down, we'll have a chat, unburden ourselves for whatever reason if we need to and it's completely trusting. That's a lovely part of any friendship.
Are there things you know about the other that even your partners don't?
Holly: I wouldn't say that, but Phil knows more about me than most of the people in my life, definitely.
Phil: Yes. I can't think there's anything that Holly knows that I haven't told my wife Steph.
Gino said, Holly: Except maybe what she got for Christmas before she opened it.
Once it's in fine' Phil: Yeah, that sort of stuff. And I always drop hints to Holly so Holly can tell Steph.
WILLOUGHBY ON Phillip LAUGH Holly: It is a good idea.
Phil to Holly: In fact, it's your fault that I hurt my knee. Because I said I would like a drone for Christmas, and if you hadn't told Steph then she would not have bought it.
Holly: Did you see what happened there?
I'm now being blamed for you getting too p*****. There was nothing wrong with the drone, it was something wrong with the man handling it.
What is the first drink the other will order?
Holly: Well, it depends where we are and what we're doing.
Phil: Well, Holly has an incredible knack of picking what I'm going to order in restaurants. She'll pretty much guess what I'm going to have.
Holly: Because it's always the slightly weird thing on the menu, like the partridge or something that you wouldn't normally cook at home, I've noticed. But drink-wise, I don't know. Start at A?
Phil: We often order the same and work our way through.
Holly: It used to be tequila, tequila, tequila all the time and then you ruined me, but I'm trying to get back into it.
Phil: You make it sound like it's running or something healthy.
What's the worst thing you've ever seen the other do?
Holly: When we had that guy on who was talking about eating insects and you ate them. There are a few, actually. You ate a fox when we did that roadkill item, too.
Phil: Oh yes, and the dog food. Yeah, you've seen me do quite a lot of horrible stuff. And I can't say that I have seen Holly do anything horrible because she makes me do it.
If you had to swap each other for a dream presenting partner, who would it be and why?
Phil: Daenerys Targaryen from Game of Thrones because she's got dragons, and I've never presented with anyone who's got dragons. I've presented with a couple of dragons, but never with anyone who's got a dragon.
Holly: I would probably swap you for someone out of Scandal, which I'm obsessed with at the moment, so it would have to be Kerry Washington. She fixes everything, she'd have all the gossip and she knows the President, so we would be able to get him on as a guest.
Do you have any annoying habits?
Holly: Yes. I say, "Umm..." and then say nothing. My mum does it, too.
anyone has Phillip ON THRONES CO-Phil: Yeah, Holly does do that quite a bit. Out of nowhere she'll just go "Umm", and everything stops and you look at her and wait and she'll just carry on doing what she's doing and has nothing to say.
Holly: I obviously panic when it's silent for too long, so I feel like I have to make some sort of noise.
Phil: I've got used to it now, so I just ignore it. What's my annoying habit?
Holly: You're very tidy. You tidy up my stuff quite a lot on the table, but that doesn't annoy me, I quite like it.
Do you have any unfulfilled ambitions?
Phil: I want to be Tim Peake. I'd love to look back from out of space.
Holly: I would like to step in for Victoria Beckham if she doesn't do the Spice Girls reunion - and I'd lip sync. I have frequently spoken to Emma Bunton about it and she said, "You can't fill in for her because you're too similar to me". Because we're both blonde, she said it would not work, but I am willing to dye my hair.
Phil: And I will be on the front row.
who If you were Prime Minister for the day, what law would you enact?
dragons Phil: I would scrap Inheritance Tax.
GAME OF HOST DREAM Holly: I would introduce a three-day weekend.
t Phil: And naked Fridays.
As household names, and being on our TV screens daily, you must both get recognised all the time. Where is the strangest place anyone has asked you for a selfie?
And how do you feel about them?
Phil: A guy once asked me for a selfie when I was having a pee. We were peeing beside each other and he said, "Can I have a selfie?" I replied, "Well, not here". I washed my hands and he said "Shall we do it now?", and I said, "No, not in the loo. Let's go back in the restaurant". That was quite recent.
Holly: I've done selfies with people in the loo. Not while I was on the loo, of course, but by the sink.
Clover the puppy is a new addition to This Morning - how is she settling in to the show?
Is the old adage true that you should never work with children or animals?
Holly: Clover has been great. I had been trying to get a dog on the show since I started, really, and the answer was always "no", mainly because of Phil. And he does make a good point.
Phil: Who would have it at the bloody weekend?
If we had a This Morning dog that was ours, who looks after it?
Holly: But whoever's genius idea it was to get a guide dog puppy in training and see how we could be part of its life, rather than it being part of the show, was a much better idea. She's training, and we can watch her progress.
Congratulations on the NTA nomination. How does it feel to be nominated for Best Live Magazine Show by the public?
Phil: It's a huge honour that we're nominated, and the night is always great because the team all get together.
Holly: It's one of my favourite nights of the year because, regardless of the awards - which are wonderful and nominated by people who enjoy the shows, and that's lovely - it's just so nice to see everybody and have everybody in one room at the same time celebrating. It's brilliant fun. Too much fun, sometimes. The next day is not so fun.

The Guv'nor was disgusted by the sick photos they found... & shocked it was all hushed up; 
HATTON HEIST & TORY CHILD ABUSER

BYLINE: TOM PETTIFOR; NICK SOMMERLAD

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 4,5

LENGTH: 935 words

BRIAN Reader was horrified when his gang broke into a bank vault and found sickening photos of a leading politician abusing children.
But the notorious crook was shocked further when the thieves left the pictures for police to find - only for the Tory Cabinet minister's crimes to be hushed up.
Reader, known as The Guv'nor, is facing jail for planning last year's £14million Hatton Garden raid and claims about his previous high-profile break-in can now be revealed for the first time. 
The images are said to have been found stashed in a safety deposit box in 1971 when the gang tunnelled into a branch of Lloyds in Baker Street, Central London, and escaped with a £3million haul.
A close confidant of 76-year-old career criminal Reader said: "It was a shock for them when they found photographs of a famous politician abusing children.
"The gang were disgusted and left them lying on the floor of the vault for the police to find but nothing was ever done."
The Government of the time allegedly forced the press to stop reporting on the burglary as a matter of national security amid allegations raunchy photos of the late Princess Margaret were found in another safety deposit box in the vault.
But the latest claims, revealed to the Daily Mirror, are more disturbing and further evidence of the Establishment cover-up of powerful paedophiles.
We are not naming the politician, who has since died and was never publicly linked to allegations of child sexual abuse.
But we have passed details to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, which is set to examine claims against Labour peer Lord Janner, who died before facing trial for child sexual abuse, and Lib Dem MP Cyril Smith, whose paedophilia was exposed after his death.
Inquiry chairman Judge Goddard said in November: "We will conduct an objective fact-finding inquiry into allegations of abuse by people of public prominence associated with Westminster.
"The investigation will focus on high-profile allegations of child sexual abuse involving current or former Members of Parliament, senior civil servants, Government advisers, and members of the intelligence and security agencies.
"It will consider allegations of cover-up and conspiracy and will review the adequacy of law enforcement responses to these allegations."
If the images found by Reader had been made public at the time, it would have caused a massive political scandal.
In 1971, he was beginning a criminal career spanning five decades which would involve him in raids worth more than £150million and make him Britain's biggest thief. His gang had spent months planning the Baker Street job. They rented a leather goods shop, two doors up from the bank, and then tunnelled 40ft from the shop basement into the vaults.
Once inside, they ransacked 268 safety deposit boxes - nearly four times the 73 opened by the Hatton Garden gang.
The source said: "Brian was not well when he did Baker Street because he was only a few months out of hospital after falling on his head on another job.
"But he has great stamina and wasn't going to miss the chance of pulling off Britain's biggest ever burglary."
The raid remains the largest in British history despite claims Hatton Garden was larger. In today's money the £3million stolen would be equivalent to about £41million.
Four men were convicted of the crime, including photographer Tony Gavin and were jailed for up to 12 years, but Reader escaped prosecution.
A second source, a gang member, previously told the Mirror in 2008 that child pornography was found in the vaults but did not give further details.
He said: "We were disgusted and left it in their open boxes so police could trace the owners. We didn't want to take anything that might give us extra trouble.
All we wanted was cash and jewels." At the time of the raid, Princess Margaret's marriage to Antony Armstrong-Jones, Earl of Snowdon, was in its final stages.
In the 60s and 70s the Queen's sister was known to party hard on the Caribbean island of Mustique, where she was pictured with lover Roddy Llewellyn, a landscape gardener 17 years her junior.
She is said to have taken snaps of male friends frolicking naked but it is not known if any were ever taken of her.
The ex-raider would only say: "I can't talk about that."
Describing preparations for the breakin, the crook added: "Before we got started, myself and an accomplice dressed up in bowler hats and pinstripes and went into the bank.
"We were able to measure out the distance from the wall to the vault using an umbrella so we could calculate how far we needed to tunnel and didn't end up popping up in the wrong place."
They tunnelled under the Chicken Inn restaurant next to the bank and used explosives to blast through 3ft of reinforced concrete.
The concrete was not wired to the alarm system as it was thought to be impenetrable. Eight tons of rubble were excavated and left behind.
The raider said: "When we finally came up I was unable to fit through the hole and could only stick my head in. But others got in and grabbed the boxes."
Reader was too sick to help with the drilling but was among those who got into the vault to force open the boxes.
The first source said: "He was very good at opening them and soon the vault was piled high with empty boxes."
One of the boxes belonged to Michael X, a drug dealer and Black Power leader who was convicted of murder and hanged in Trinidad in 1975.
The story of the break-in was made into 2008 film The Bank Job, starring Jason Statham and Daniel Mays.

Notes on life by a Notebooker Name: Flavia Bertolini Lives: A Londoner born and bred (despite all those vowels in my surname). About me: I own 99 dresses. I am obsessed with hip-hop and pencils (geek). I think I am well funny. Some days my hair is bigger than me.
? Let us know what you think on Twitter at @notebooklive 
Watching TV isn't as simple as it used to be...
In caveman times, we had five channels and a video tape recorder the size of a single decker bus so you could do the very exciting thing of recording a show while watching another programme that was on a different channel - wait for it - at the SAME TIME. The power was intoxicating! Then Freeview boxes came along and we had 500 channels (450 were shopping channels, but we yay! in until watch were still giddy) and a 12-pack of shiny and high-tech recordable CDs. Then came along fancy pants channel providers that are an anagram of kyS and irginV, with live pausing and recording, and series linking, and now I have lots of good channels I very much enjoy, thank you very much, and TV is my life so don't invite me out because I'm watching Game Of Thrones.
But it doesn't end there. I get excited about a new TV show, and I find it's not on Sky or Virgin, but on Netflix. OK, that's an internet thing, right? So I can subscribe to that. Fair enough. I'll watch House Of Cards and Orange Is The New Black and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt then cancel it. What, you can link your computer to your TV and watch the interweb on your big telly? Really? Oh, sounds complicated, but maybe I'll buy a pipe thing to attach the two and do that. The seven-year-old next door will explain how. Then I'll hear about an award-winning show like say, Transparent, and think, "Oooh, brilliant, I'll watch that, what side is it on?" Amazon, that's what side. HOW CAN THAT BE A THING? Want to watch Fear The Walking Dead? You need BT TV. Have I got that? Is it included in my package? My phone line is BT so surely I have it... oh no, I haven't. How do I get that then? Then there's Talk Talk that lets you see some Freeview, some Sky. So, er, is that better? Worse? Cheaper? Huh? Then there are people telling me I'm a dang fool to bother paying for Sky/Virgin, but just to buy a Now TV box, a little cube that you plug in somewhere, maybe next to the fridge, and it magically shows you the best things from all the fancy channels.
It's too complicated. All I want to do is watch six hours straight of Scandal, is that too much to ask? Yay! I'm staying in until 2018 to watch all this telly

Scandal has ruined sport; 
NEWS FILE SPORT AROUND THE WORLD ATHLETICS

BYLINE: RICHARD EDWARDS

SECTION: SPORT; Pg. 62

LENGTH: 110 words

THE IAAF has been slammed as dishonest and wicked by one of anti-doping's most influential figures. 
Don Catlin set up the first anti-doping laboratory in Los Angeles in 1982 and is widely regarded as the father of modern drug testing.
He has watched in horror as the scandal has engulfed the IAAF - and now fears that the sport has been damaged for good.
"This is a governing body athletes completely rely on and they've been let down by an organisation that has proved itself to be dishonest and wicked," said Catlin (above).
"I fear we're now entering a period when young people will be reluctant to go into athletics. That could be hugely damaging."

Phony-ism of Burton is exposed;

THE outcry and outrage over the Tanaiste's appointment of David Begg to a job he did not look for is not going to go away. 
Members of the Independent Alliance have now put down a Dail motion of no confidence in Joan Burton for next week.
It is hard to fathom why the Labour leader would court such controversy at a time when her party could be facing election annihilation.
It is not surprising this has caused grave concern among Labour supporters and prompted two TDs to openly criticise their leader.
Indeed the electorate will question Ms Burton's judgment in light of previous comments about cronyism and lack of transparency.
The Tanaiste recently boasted that her party had changed the law to ensure an end to "cronyism" on State boards.
She said changes brought in by Labour meant appointments "must be publicly advertised".
The public should be reminded in September 2014 the Tanaiste insisted it was her "absolute preference" people apply for State board positions through the public appointments mechanism.
At the time she was commenting on the scandal surrounding John McNulty's bid to be elected to the Seanad which ultimately led to Enda Kenny having to make a public apology, admitting it was not his "finest hour".
While there is little doubt Mr Begg would be an excellent chair of the Pension Authority the manner of his appointment smacks of double standards, cronyism and rank hypocrisy.

Recycling is burnt due to poor sorting

BYLINE: KEITH PERRY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 11

LENGTH: 118 words

HUNDREDS of thousands of tonnes of recycling is being burned or sent to landfill sites - because councils claim it has not been sorted correctly. 
The amount of waste incinerated or going to landfill has nearly doubled in three years, despite councils' green initiatives.
Last year some councils rejected as many as one in five recycling bins as they had not been sorted correctly, with entire loads discarded if they contained a tiny amount of food waste, plastic or fabric.
In 2012, 184,000 tonnes of recycling was thrown away. Last year the number hit 338,000, an 84% increase, the Freedom of Information figures reveal.
The areas with the worst records are the London boroughs of Newham, Hammersmith and Fulham.

Co-op Bank bosses' ban; 
£260k fine for pair after reckless actions CITY DESK

BYLINE: GRAHAM HISCOTT

SECTION: FEATURES; OPINION COLUMN; Pg. 40

LENGTH: 367 words

TWO former Co-op Bank bosses have been given a lifetime ban after the lender's near collapse.
Ex-chief executive Barry Tootell and Keith Alderson, who ran the lender's corporate banking arm, were also fined a total of £262,000 by City regulator the Prudential Regulation Authority. 
"The actions of Mr Tootell and Mr Alderson posed an unacceptable threat to the safety and soundness of the Co-op Bank," said Andrew Bailey, PRA chief and a Bank of England deputy governor.
The move marks the first time the boss of any bank has been formally censured since the financial crisis of 2008.
It comes after the Co-op Bank nearly collapsed in 2013 after a £1.5billion black hole was discovered in its balance sheet.
The bank was rescued by bondholders, including US hedge funds, in a move that saw the wider Co-op group's stake in the bank slashed to 20%.
The PRA said Tootell "did not exercise due skill, care and diligence" in his role as chief financial officer and later chief executive of the bank.
It said Alderson "did not take reasonable steps" to properly assess the risks of the corporate loan book of the Britannia Building Society, which merged with the Co-op Bank in 2009.
Tootell was fined £173,802 and Alderson £88,890, with the pair banned from holding a senior job in any regulated bank or insurer.
The Co-operative Group was also engulfed by scandal after controversial former chairman Paul Flowers, who was a Methodist minister, was filmed buying Class A drugs and later fined for drugs possession.
Britain's other City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, is also believed to be looking at the role of certain Co-op Bank executives before beginning a probe into it's near collapse.
It said: "We don't comment on individual cases.
"While we have previously indicated that work will not start on the review until it is clear it will have no prejudicial effect on any future cases, we are not at that stage yet."
Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors, said: "The Co-op traded on its reputation as an ethical and reliable bank but while senior executives and the board may have believed their own hype, they manifestly failed to embody these principles, with devastating results."

Prison officer arrested over 'affair with killer'; 
Woman suspended after internal probe

BYLINE: CHRIS KILPATRICK

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 7

LENGTH: 359 words

A PRISON officer at Northern Ireland's maximum security jail has been arrested over an alleged affair with a murderer.
The woman has also been suspended from work at Maghaberry Prison after an internal investigation. 
She could face a charge of gross misconduct in public office. The prisoner is currently serving a sentence for murder.
He is understood to have been moved to an isolation unit in the prison.
The pair are believed to have worked together in the kitchen.
A police spokesman said: "PSNI have arrested a female on suspicion of misconduct in a public office. There are no further details."
In a statement, the Department of Justice said: "NI Prison Service can confirm a member of staff has been suspended following an internal investigation.
"This is now a matter for the PSNI and it would be inappropriate to comment further."
Last week an inspection team arrived at Maghaberry for a fortnight-long review after a report branded it "unsafe".
In November, the Mirror revealed how a teacher had been suspended from her job at the same jail after allegedly sending a murderer a birthday card. She was one of two female staff removed from their posts.
One was suspected of sending a greeting card to Louis Maguire who is serving a life sentence for gunning down his wife's former lover in March 2003.
The card was alleged to have said "I love you".
The other teacher was suspended for allegedly racially abusing a rapist.
Maguire, 49, was convicted of murdering David "Digger" Barnes in North Belfast. The 39-year-old was shot as he lay in bed beside his girlfriend after the gunman broke into the flat at Brookvale Avenue.
Maguire, with a previous address at Whinpark Road in Newtownards, Co Down, was said to have carried out the shooting on weekend leave while serving a prison sentence for robbery.
In 2006 he received a 24-year term after being convicted of the murder and a separate arson attack on the home of a relative of Mr Barnes.
Maguire launched an appeal against the guilty verdicts in May by claiming the trial was unfair.
The court heard he was not represented for 54 of the 75 days of his hearing. The appeal process is continuing.

THE scandal of rip-off car insurance must be tackled.
In recent years the industry has been getting away with murder, quoting young motorists outrageous amounts of up to (EURO)9,000.
They can list the reasons for such ridiculous premiums all they want.
But the bottom line is they are in the risk industry - and are still making healthy profits.
The Government's response that it can do little to confront the issue is feeble in the extreme.
It can no longer turn a blind eye as consumers, many of whom have never even made claims, are being ripped off left right and centre.

A government of broken dreams...and promises

BYLINE: PAT FLANAGAN

SECTION: FEATURES; OPINION COLUMN; Pg. 15

LENGTH: 652 words

WE'RE well used to political parties breaking election promises, but it's not often they do it before the actual vote.
Last week Fine Gael said the abolition of the hated Universal Social Charge would be a key promise, but yesterday the Finance Minister said this might not be the case.
Apparently there will be new levies for those on big wages and we know that when times get tough these people see the average industrial wage as big money. 
The Labour party also promised to do away with USC for those earning up to (EURO)70,000 while everybody earning up to (EURO)120,000 will enjoy some level of tax cut.
The USC, which is a second tier of income tax on workers, is such a money-spinner that the Government is unlikely to ever let it go.
What they intend doing is removing it in name and bringing in new levies on high earners which will gradually claw their way down to tap those on modest incomes.
This week the air was thick with election promises as both Fine Gael and Labour desperately sought to get back into power.
They know there's a lot at stake as a TD elected to the next Dail is in line to earn up to (EURO)500,000 and pocket another (EURO)250,000 in allowances and expenses over the next five years.
So when you look at it from that perspective, it's not surprising they are willing to lie through their teeth to get their hands on the equivalent of a Lotto Plus jackpot.
Of course they'll all say the money has nothing to do with it, but you never see the best-paid politicians in Europe complaining they are being given too much.
Last Monday Enda Kenny and Joan Burton thanked the people for their "hard work" and slapped themselves on the backs for their great achievements.
They want their Lotto They promised stability and continued recovery and warned against voting in left-wingers who might upset things, ie deprive their lot of the Lotto jackpot.
When they made even bigger promises before the last election, who would have imagined that exactly five years on there would be 434 people languishing on trolleys in the country's hospitals and up to 1,500 homeless children living in hotels and hostels.
Remember how the Taoiseach promised a political revolution and transparency and openness and how Paddy liked to know what was going on? Such is the contempt the Taoiseach has for the public he couldn't be bothered to even disclose the date of the general election.
Paddy likes to know alright, but he's not going to tell him.
just to get Yesterday it was hands on jackpot impossible to take Joan Burton's promises of childcare seriously when just a few months ago she slashed the benefits of single-parent families which she had earlier pledged would not take place until a "Scandinavian model" of childcare was in place.
But, to be fair, the Coalition was strapped for cash early on in their term of office so I won't bring up breaking the pledge not to raise third-level college fees or cut grants.
I also won't mention the housing crisis, the waiting list scandal, bank repossessions, medical card cuts, child poverty, JobBridge, carer cuts and a few dozen more betrayals.
All of these were motivated by money. But what is unforgivable is the Coalition's failure to fulfil its promises to reform the political system and end cronyism.
In what can only be described as a two-fingered parting salute to the public, Burton goes and appoints former union boss David Begg to a (EURO)20,000-a-year post on a State board without following public appointment rules.
And it's not just me who believes this.
Labour Deputy Ciara Conway admitted Joan is effectively guilty of stroke politics.
She asked: "Why have the rules in place if you're not going to abide by them? "I don't understand that, even as someone in government, even as somebody in my own party. Why set a rule and then break it?" Because this is Ireland, Deputy Conway and nothing ever seems to change.
They just want to get their hands on Lotto jackpot

The French manufacturer confirmed swoops at three sites to probe its vehicle emissions technology.
It stressed they found "no evidence of a defeat device equipping Renault vehicles" - but shares fell by a fifth before closing down 10%.
French energy minister Segolene Royal added: "There is no fraud at Renault. Shareholders and employees should be reassured."
The raids follow the scandal over Volkswagen fitting software to cheat US diesel emissions tests.

MORE U-TURNS THAN A LEARNER DRIVER

BYLINE: DAVE KIDD

LENGTH: 295 words

SO Seb Coe says he didn't know there was a culture of corruption embedded in the IAAF.
Even though Dick Pound's report claims the IAAF Council, which included Lord Coe, "could not have been unaware of the extent of doping in athletics". 
One day Coe insists there was no cover-up into the Russian doping scandal, the next day he accepts there must have been a cover-up.
"We're not in denial," he said, after yesterday's publication of WADA's independent report into systematic doping in Russian athletics.
Even though on Wednesday Coe was denying just that.
Not that Coe was part of the cover-up.
He just didn't know about it. Even though Pound says he couldn't have not known.
And yet Pound claims Coe, despite having been vicepresident to Lamine Diack - his corrupt predecessor as IAAF president - for seven years, is the ideal man to lead the organisation forward. Not even Steve Ovett ever found Coe this elusive.
Pound is surely operating on a gut feeling here.
Coe seems to him an upstanding chap, so keep on running athletics, your Lordship.
After all it's not as if Coe had shown huge reluctance in cutting his lucrative ties with Nike, despite widespread claims of a conflict of interests, after taking up the IAAF presidency in August. Oh, hang on...
It is impossible to know whether Coe was complicit, naive or incompetent.
But it is difficult to imagine he wasn't at least one of those three things. Otherwise what was he doing during seven years as vice-president to warrant the top job? Allegations against his former friend Diack were "abhorrent" admitted Coe. The whole thing was a "horror show".
But he hadn't known about it. Even though Pound says he must have done. And yet Pound says the crisis-ridden sport doesn't need a new broom to sweep it clean. Clear as mud.

FORMER Essendon player Michael Quinn has revealed his disappointment that the careers of many ex-colleagues have been tarnished by the doping scandal which has rocked Aussie Rules. 
A dozen current Essendon players are among 34 in total that have been banned until November, effectively a season, due to doping violations at the club in 2012.
Longford colossus Quinn wasn't implicated as he was delisted by the club before the offences took place.
But he revealed: "I would have played with the majority of those players. I wouldn't have talked to them since but I'd feel for them, a lot of their careers were effectively put on hold, if not ended."
Quinn (left) believes there's no cause for alarm in the GAA regarding the use of supplements.
He said: "The guys at that level in the GAA, they would question everything. Even something as simple as a cold or flu, straight away it's 'ring the doctor and see if it's okay to take this or not'."

Dear Energy Boss,

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 22

LENGTH: 305 words

YOU''VE probably never had to worry about whether you can afford to put your heating on when winter comes.
Sadly, for millions of older people in Britain today that simply isn't the case. Last winter, 43,900 pensioners died in England and Wales from cold related illnesses - the highest number for 15 years. 
This represented 365 deaths a day, or 15 an hour, and there is no doubt that one of the main reasons why people think twice about putting their heating on is because they worry about whether they can afford to pay the bill.
Successive governments have simply ignored the problem of winter deaths among the older population. You too have had a similar approach. But this simply won't work.
More than half of all older people are now worried about the cost of heating their homes, while over two million say they would cut down on food in order to pay their bills.
This is a national scandal.
Older people and others on low incomes need to have a well-insulated, warm home and the income needed to pay the fuel bills.
This is a basic requirement of what a decent society should do.
But making bills affordable also means looking again at how your companies operate.
Over the past two years wholesale prices have fallen by almost 50%.
But the average household bill of more than £1,300 a year has come down by only 14%.
Increases in fuel bills go up like a rocket, but refunds come down like a feather.
It''s clear the energy market simply doesn't serve the consumer, only the shareholders. But it has to stop.
A fuel poverty commission should be set up as a matter of urgency with the task of finding solutions to this problem.
Solution such as rolling out a more effective programme to insulate homes, building more suitable properties for older people, raising the winter fuel allowance... And tackling your excessive profits.
Yours, Dot Gibson

Committee chiefs on gravy train EXCLUSIVE

SECTION: FEATURES; Pg. 2

LENGTH: 344 words

SIX select committee chiefs from the last parliament have now got private sector jobs in industries they used to scrutinise.
The five Tories and one Liberal Democrat are all earning thousands of pounds working as consultants. 
Tory MP Graham Stuart, chairman of the Commons education committee during the last Parliament, now trousers £520-an-hour from education consultancy TES Global.
Fellow Tory Baroness Anne McIntosh, head of the environment committee until May 2015, has set up her own consultancy to offer "strategic advice on food, farming and the environment".
A third, Lord James Arbuthnot, the ex-defence committee chairman, is now a part-time adviser to defence giants Thales Group and Babcock International.
And Lib Dem Lord Malcolm Bruce, the former international development committee chairman, is a senior adviser to global development consultants DAI Europe. He said last night: "I was delighted to take up roles that allow me to stay connected in the development world. These are very much part-time, advisory roles."
All four are pocketing the cash on top of their Parliamentary pay and expenses.
It comes after the Mirror revealed how former Tory health committee chairman Stephen Dorrell had taken a job with KPMG as it bid last year for a £1billion NHS contract. And ex-energy committee chairman Tim Yeo has been criticised over his leadership of AFC Energy. Chairing a select committee is one of the most powerful backbench positions.
Members pick topics to investigate, grill witnesses and write reports.
Labour MP Paul Flynn said: "It is outrageous there is no scrutiny of this. Frankly there should be a ban of at least five years on these people taking one of these 'retirement jobs'. One of the most vital functions of committees is to look at commercial interests without there being any suggestion of bias."
A Mirror probe revealed on Monday at least 25 ex-Coalition ministers are earning huge salaries in the industries they were paid to www.oversee.No 10 said the system has been "tightened up".

THE Government's decision to remove complaints about Irish Water from the remit of the Ombudsman's office has been slammed as political arrogance.
Independent TD Mattie McGrath, who had sought the establishment of a watchdog as part of a Private Members Bill, said the move will only serve to make the hated firm more of a law unto itself.
He added: "It effectively means there is now no independent oversight of this monstrosity and that is an absolute scandal.
"For the Government to say the Energy Regulator will deal with whatever complaints arise is an insult to the intelligence of the Irish people."

Fight to end homeless crisis hit by 'wasted' cash

BYLINE: ADELINA CAMPOS

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 210 words

THE Government is wasting money by tackling the homelessness crisis in the wrong way, it has been claimed.
Campaigner Fr Peter McVerry said while a lot of money has been allocated to the problem the resources are not being used www.well.Fr McVerry spoke out after an independent review of taxpayer-funded homeless charities found they are "not value for money". 
He told the Irish Daily Mirror: "We have the resources to eliminate it, but no political will.
"There is a huge amount spent on emergency and temporary accommodation but that is not a solution."Fr McVerry estimates it costs (EURO)30,000 to provide a homeless person with a room in a hostel or B&B - five times more than providing them with a flat.
He said: "If we provide 10 homeless people with rooms in a hostel, that's (EURO)300,000 a year, and it largely includes the cost to run the hostel.
"If you put them into apartments, you can have one staff member who could support these 10 people.
"It costs around (EURO)5,000 or (EURO)6,000 per person [up to (EURO)60,000 for all 10]."Fr McVerry's view was backed by the Governmentcommissioned report which found some of the (EURO)95.9million received by homeless charities in 2014 may have been wasted by overlapping services.

Scandal-hit VW driven into legal nightmare

SECTION: EDITORIAL; OPINION COLUMNS; Pg. 10

LENGTH: 234 words

VOLKSWAGEN would surely love a fresh start in 2016 after last year was defined by a massive emissionscheating scandal. But any hopes the German car maker had of trying to shake off its troubles came to a grinding halt this week when it was announced the US justice department is to sue. 
In September last year, following an investigation by American regulators, VW admitted fitting the so-called defeat device on 11 million vehicles globally.
The scandal hit sales worldwide with the company setting aside billions of euro to deal with the fallout.
The lawsuit, on behalf of the US Environmental Protection Agency, was filed in a federal court in Detroit, Michigan.
HARMFUL It reads: "The complaint alleges nearly 600,000 diesel engine vehicles had illegal defeat devices installed that impair their emission control systems and cause emissions to exceed EPA's standards, resulting in harmful air pollution."
It also claims VW "violated" clean air laws by selling cars that were different in design from those originally cleared for sale by the EPA.
The move leaves the firm open to action around the world.
The case may still see the death of the diesel car in the US where VW had been promoting the fuel as a clean alternative to gasoline.
The firm entered the States hoping to live the American dream yet it has proved to be their worse nightmare.
If only everything in life was a reliable as a Volkswagen, huh?

NHS whistleblowing tsar works just 2 days a week; 
And part-time anti-bully dame keeps £174k roles

BYLINE: ANDREW GREGORY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 324 words

THE new NHS whistleblowing tsar will work two days a week - and keep her £174,000 job at a busy hospital trust.
Dame Eileen Sills was this week unveiled in the role aimed at preventing another Mid Staffs scandal which cost 1,400 lives. 
The job was a key demand by Sir Robert Francis, who led the inquiry into the deaths, to stop staff being bullied for reporting poor patient care.
But Dame Eileen will work part time on this enormous challenge - while staying as Chief Nurse and Director of Patient Experience and Infection Control at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, which handles 2 million patients a year.
She also remains on the trust's board.
Health policy analyst and former NHS trust chairman Roy Lilley said the parttime approach was "an affront to anyone suffering merely because they wanted to tell the truth about where they work".
He added: "It waves two fingers at anyone reduced to tears by a thug of a boss, a shift from hell or has the misfortune to witness malpractice."
Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said on Thursday Dame Eileen would "inspire the NHS to go even further in improving how staff can raise concerns".
Dame Eileen will be based at the Care Quality Commission NHS watchdog. The only role she has dropped at the London trust is executive lead for Speaking Up Safely to prevent any conflict of interest.
The CQC will reimburse Guy's and St Thomas' £56,800 a year for their lost time. Her duties will include supporting whistleblower guardians in 155 trusts.
Julie Bailey, who exposed Mid Staffs, deaths said: "I want someone independent to challenge and expose NHS bullies."
Dame Eileen has nursed for more than 30 years and helped treat 7/7 terror victims. She was made a Dame last year.
Guy's and St Thomas' said last night: "We have every confidence in Eileen's ability to balance the various demands of these two important roles."
Dame Eileen declined to comment.

HEALTH Secretary Jeremy Hunt's encouragement of NHS whistleblowers is seriously questioned when he picks a gamekeeper to supposedly encourage poachers to report abuses in hospitals. 
Dame Eileen Sills is an esteemed public servant yet her £174,000 job running one of Britain's busiest NHS trusts raises concerns about her suitability to challenge the system.
Devoting just two days a week to the new National Guardian role makes it sound a tick-box exercise by a Government that prefers to keep dirty linen secret rather than wash it in public.
Surely a ferocious independent figure from outside the NHS, dedicated to the task full-time, is more likely to champion whistleblowers than a management insider.
The Staffordshire hospital scandal sounded an alarm. Hunt, facing a doctors' strike, mustn't now muffle concerned medical staff.

Villa are doomed so pick the hungry, young kids and slash prices for next season

SECTION: SPORT; Pg. 55

LENGTH: 609 words

ASTON VILLA'S plight as relegation certainties is not just a scandal. It's a crying shame.
There will be Villans supporters who think I am relishing their desperate situation. Nothing could be further from the truth.
I had a great record going to Villa Park as a player, but I have only respect for the club's heritage and historic ground.
I hate to see them miles adrift at the bottom of the Premier League, so while fans wait for owner Randy Lerner to explain how he is going to lead them out of this mess, I suggest they start planning for life in the Championship. 
Let's get real: Villa (keeper Brad Guzan, right) are going down. Eight points from 20 games is beyond redemption.
First of all they must decide if Remi Garde is the manager to lead them back up at the first time of asking.
If there are signs of improvement in the second half of the season, he deserves a chance - but Garde has yet to win a game and the Championship is a brutal division if you don't know the ropes.
If not Garde, there is a man out there who knows how to win it - Nigel Pearson. He took Leicester up and then worked a miracle to keep the Foxes in the top flight.
Second, there is no point in Villa paying huge transfer fees and massive wages in this transfer window to try and stay up. It's too late for that.
All they would attract is loan players, who aren't good enough to get in their current teams, or old sweats after one last payday - and I should know, because that's why I went to Derby.
From now on, there must be an emphasis on young, hungry players in selection and recruitment.
Give youngsters experience now and they will be more battle-hardened for the challenge ahead next season.
Third, slash ticket prices for 2016-17 - partly as an apology for this season's woeful performances and partly to make sure Villa are not playing in a half-empty stadium every week.
I joined the Derby team who went down in 2008 as the worst Premier League side of all time with just 11 points and it took them years to recover.
It was such a chastening experience, it drove me to the brink of depression. I honestly believe a loan spell at Brighton saved my sanity because it was a horrible, horrible season.
You are questioned by fans and teammates when you are miles adrift at the bottom if you arrive for training showing off in a £150,000 Mercedes or a nice Bentley (even if you earned it through 15 years of hard graft).
You worry about turning up on matchdays with a stereotypical footballer's Louis Vuitton washbag in case that gives the fans an excuse to hammer you.
You are scared to go out in the city at night if you live locally.
You dread turning up for training, knowing the quality is simply not there to stay up.
You get cliques forming in the squad - those loyal to the manager and others who are happy to look after No.1 in the hope of engineering a move away.
You look around the dressing room, identifying the players who will go missing on a Saturday and think, "He's not going to pull us out of trouble, nor him, nor him..."
Basically, you are frightened to play football. It's a nightmare scenario, the worst feeling I experienced in 20 years as a player.
At Derby, we tried everything to lift the pall of gloom around the place, including a 'fun' day at training where winners of novelty races won a bar of chocolate. But there's no fun in being rock-bottom with eight points in January.
That season, we lost 6-0 at home to Villa, with Stan Petrov scoring from near the halfway line. I can scarcely believe that, only eight years later, the boot is on the other foot and a club of Villa's stature is in such a dreadful state.

Many will face severe hardship as a result.
It is testimony to the hard work of the 'WASPI Campaign' (Women Against State Pension Inequality) that MPs from all parties gave such passionate speeches to Parliament over the issue yesterday.
It seems to be finally dawning on the Government that they must rectify the problem or land in court.

Asda boss siphoned £180k from flood-victim charity

BYLINE: LUCY THORNTON

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 14

LENGTH: 137 words

AN Asda boss and ex-government adviser is facing jail after he transferred £180,000 from the firm's flood-victim charity into his partner's ballet company. 
Shamed Paul Kelly, 55, ex-vice president of corporate affairs at Asda, claimed the money was to help floodhit communities but the cash went into David Murley's dance school.
Kelly was also the chairman of Asda's charitable foundation and a government adviser on food policy and obesity before the scandal erupted.
Mr Murley, 36, has performed with Madonna, the Royal Opera and English National Opera. Mr Kelly left Asda just days before he was due to sit on a panel with then-Labour Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper.
Kelly, who lives in an £800,000 London home, pleaded guilty to seven charges of fraud at Leeds crown court on Monday and will be sentenced next month.

Leo: I would be loath to make a promise to end the hospital trolley crisis; 
(Perhaps this is why..) ; Health Minister's warning solution could take years as nurses group claims 516 wait for beds

BYLINE: DAVID MAHER

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 451 words

HEALTH Minister Leo Varadkar yesterday warned a solution to the hospital trolley crisis could take years.
And he admitted it would be unwise for any politician to promise to eliminate the problem - after he was reminded of Fine Gael's embarrassing 2007 election pledge to do just that. 
He added: "I'd be very loath to make that kind of promise.
"It's almost like promising there would never be a child leaving a school illiterate or that crime would only ever go down.
"I think anyone who makes those kind of promises doesn't understand the true complexities of what we face."
The minister spoke during a tour of emergency departments at St James's Hospital, Dublin, yesterday.
He said the number of patients on trolleys is down 15% but the health service is still nowhere near where it needs to be. Despite the overall number of people waiting for beds falling since this time last year, the sector is still not up to scratch.
There are 516 patients on trolleys nationwide, according to figures compiled by the Irish Nurses' and Midwives' Organisation.
Mr Varadkar said: "This is not a problem that is going to be solved quickly.
"We're in better shape than we were last year but we're still not in good shape. There is no quick fix but the fact we're in a better position than we were last year indicates some of the measures have made a difference.
"These need to be sustained over a number of years, not just over one or two. Other health services do a lot better than we do and we can improve our performance a lot.
"Patients on trolleys are down 15% but the health service is still nowhere near where it needs to be."
Minister Varadkar said improving the situation would take a number of years and it would be unwise for any politician to make a promise to eliminate trolley waits entirely.
Minister Varadkar's words come despite the fact his party circulated an election campaign flyer featuring Taoiseach Enda Kenny making that exact claim.
It reads "I'll end the scandal of patients on trolleys" next to a picture of the Taoiseach.
According to INMO figures, there are 409 patients on trolleys in hospital emergency departments and a further 107 on trolleys in wards across the country. Fianna Fail health spokesperson Billy Kelleher described Minister Varadkar's comments as "quite extraordinary".
He said: "This Government is in office almost five years, we've had two ministers for health and Fine Gael told the whole country they had a costed, credible plan for the health service which they have since been forced to abandon entirely.
"It's simply not good enough for Minister Varadkar to glibly say 'we're nowhere near where we need to be'.
"Perhaps he'd like to do something about it?" david.maher@irishmirror.ie

Constituents support disgraced MP; 
EXCLUSIVE

BYLINE: AMANDA KILLELEA

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 17

LENGTH: 423 words

IS he a pop star? Is he a footballer? No.
The man getting a celebrity reception in Rochdale is suspended MP Simon Danczuk. The disgraced politician is reeling from revelations that he sent sex texts to a 17-year-old dominatrix, Sophena Houlihan. 
Yet shoppers in the town centre stopped to offer their support to Danczuk, 49, as we joined him during his two-hour walkabout to grovel to constituents yesterday.
One woman said: "I think he's been stupid, but what man isn't when he has had a drink? He has got my backing."
Danczuk admitted the last seven days had been "wearing" but, despite their divorce coming through just days ago, he said he only made it through them thanks to his selfie queen ex-wife Karen, 32. Danczuk continued: "If it weren't for people like Karen, I would have probably said I'd had enough. Karen has a heart of gold and I don't think her public persona does her justice."
While Karen yesterday said her ex-husband had worked himself "almost to death" to become an MP. "Politics is his life and the threat of that one thing being taken away from him has really, really shocked him," she told LBC.
"For me, I am glad he has been suspended in a way because he needs that break. I think he can make a comeback."
His first marriage to Sonia Rossington, 39 - mother of his children Marymartha, 13, and George, 18 - is also under the spotlight and it was alleged she advertised herself as an escort after they split in 2007.
Asked about the claims, Danczuk said: "Disgusting. I had heard rumours about it." And on the girl he told by text he wanted to "spank" being outed as a dominatrix, he said: "She is obviously more experienced and knowledgeable in these issues than I am. It is up to her what she does. She is an adult. She seemed a nice person."
He recently split from girlfriend Claire Hamilton, 32.
He said: "I am quite cautious about getting involved in a relationship again." Despite being suspended, Danczuk is convinced his Labour career is not over yet. He added: "I do wonder if there is a class issue.
Boris Johnson has a messy personal life but he doesn't find himself on the Radio 4 Today programme being slated. Why should that happen to me just because I am working class?" Constituent John Ellis agreed. The retired barber said: "I honestly think there are a lot of people out to get him."
While most seemed to be on Danczuk's side, some 20 protestors were outside his office, calling for his resignation.
If it weren't for people like Karen, I would have said I'd had enough SIMON DANCZUK on support from ex-wife

Shamed MP to sue over ex's claim he is a sex predator; 
Danczuk blasts 'malicious' allegations

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 7

LENGTH: 547 words

SIMON Danczuk is set to take legal action over his first wife's claims he is a "predator" who had sex with her while she was asleep.
The MP - suspended from Labour for his sex texts to a girl of 17 - instructed solicitors over "untrue allegations of a criminal nature" by Sonia Rossington.
Ms Rossington, 39, claimed she was "in therapy for years" over her 10-year marriage to Mr Danczuk. 
She alleged the politician, 49, would demand a cannabis joint readily rolled for when he got home and "expected sex morning and night, seven days a week".
Ms Rossington told The Mail on Sunday: "When he came to bed he would have sex with me, interrupting my sleep.
"I would just wake up and it was happening."
She alleged the incidents happened when he was drinking a bottle of whisky a night and lasted as little as 15 seconds.
When she challenged Mr Danczuk, she claimed FRIEND OF FIRST WIFE'S she was told: "You are my wife and it's expected from a wife to give her husband sex whenever he wants it." Rochdale MP Mr Danczuk hit back, claiming Ms Rossington had made "malicious allegations" for cash and asked for a "sixfigure sum" to "dish the dirt".
He said in a statement: "These untrue allegations are of a criminal nature and she has chosen not to take them to police but to sell them to a national newspaper.
"Our marriage ended long before our official divorce in 2010.
"Despite it being nearly 10 years since we've had any kind of relationship, she has not moved on and remains embittered to the point where she has prevented me from seeing or having a close relationship with my children." He added: "She has also become obsessed with trying to ruin my political career.
"Ever since I was elected an MP in 2010 she has been pestering journalists, trying to spread malicious falsehoods and defamatory allegations about me.
"Out of respect for the fact she is the mother to two of my children I have not responded to her continual abuse and hoped people would see her years-long vendetta for what it is.
"But I can no longer allow her to continue to spread hurtful allegations that are totally unfounded and malicious."
A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said the force was not aware of any formal complaint against Mr Danczuk over the new claims. Police launched a probe last week into Mr Danczuk over his steamy texts to student Sophena Houlihan, but said at the time no offence had been committed.
Mr Danczuk was blasted over the sexting scandal by his most recent ex-girlfriend Claire Hamilton, 32, who branded him a "selfobsessed narcissist". But he found support from selfie-loving second wife Karen, 32, who accused his other exes of being "money-grabbing leaches [sic]".
Last night a close friend of Mr Danczuk said: "If some of the allegations Sonia makes were true then why didn't she go to police at the time? Why is she only coming out with this now?"
And despite his suspension from the Labour party, Mr Danczuk, who spent yesterday working in his constituency office, is vowing to fight for his career.
The friend said: "In his view it's not up to embittered ex-wives or partners to decide who is the MP of Rochdale, but the people of Rochdale."

Swansea's quest for Chile boss hotting up

BYLINE: DAVID McDONNELL

SECTION: SPORT; Pg. 43

LENGTH: 249 words

SWANSEA will soon find out whether Chile coach Jorge Sampaoli wants to be their new boss as he enters crunch talks with his current employers. 
Sampaoli, 55, one of the candidates Swans chairman Huw Jenkins met in South America last month, has a key meeting today to discuss whether he remains in charge of his country.
Chile's FA will elect a new president after Sergio Jadue was forced to quit after being caught up in the FIFA corruption scandal.
Once that decision is made, the new man will meet FIFA Coach of the Year nominee Sampaoli (right), who has been in dispute with the association over the make-up of his backroom staff - despite leading them to Copa America glory last year.
Former Argentina boss Marcelo Bielsa was the favourite to become Swans boss following talks with Jenkins in Rosario, but his interest cooled over concerns about a financial package and the length of contract on offer at the Liberty Stadium.
Sampaoli is one of Bielsa's disciples and is believed to have impressed Jenkins as he tries to find the right man to replace Garry Monk and keep Swansea in the Premier League.
Gylfi Sigurdsson (below) hit an equaliser to give the Swans hope against Manchester United, but Wayne Rooney won the game to further increase the pressure on them. Swansea could face competition for the Argentinian from Chelsea and Roma.
Sampaoli has spoken of his desire to coach in Europe, saying, "It is something I would probably like to do, but it would need to be discussed at the proper time."

££He is more interested in being a celebrity than life as an MP; 
DANCZUK'S LOVER ON THEIR THREE-MONTH AFFAIR EXCLUSIVE

BYLINE: GRACE MACASKILL

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 4,5

LENGTH: 1245 words

SEX texts MP Simon Danczuk is today slammed by his former girlfriend as a self-obsessed Jekyll and Hyde who cried like a baby when she dumped him.
Claire Hamilton lifted the lid on their bizarre three-month romance after the disgraced Labour backbencher was caught sending lewd messages to a girl aged 17.
Councillor Claire said he manipulated her for publicity and arranged for them to go on a night out with his estranged wife Karen - then took pictures as the two women kissed.
And Claire, 32, accused the disgraced MP of being more concerned with his own profile than the needs of constituents in Rochdale, Lancs. 
She said; "He craves attention so much from anywhere he can get it, but he's sunk to a new low this time.
"He told me he had come up with a plan for 2016 to make more money out of the celebrity and press side of things than from being an MP."
Claire and Danczuk, 49, met at the Labour conference in September and within a week of their first date he had told her he loved her.
But she says he later "behaved appallingly". He became insanely jealous if men showed her attention.
Claire dumped Danczuk on Twitter only a day after they posted cheerful selfies during the floods crisis.
They had a bust-up after Simon confessed to sending texts to Sophena Houlihan, which led to him being suspended from the Labour Party.
ATTENTION
He had asked Sophena if she "wanted a spank" and told her: "God, I'm horny."
Branding him a "self-obsessed narcissist", quietly-spoken Claire said: "He's not fit to be an MP. Everything is all about Simon. It's all about attention. He doesn't care where it comes from, even if it's from a teenager.
"He's a real Jeykll and Hyde character. You get the public Simon who claims to care passionately about things, then the Simon who drinks too much and doesn't care who he hurts to get his own way.
"He follows loads of random young women on Twitter so who knows who else he has been texting and sending messages to. He's finally pressed the self-destruct button."
Danczuk started messaging Sophena after she asked him for a job, weeks after he split from wife Karen.
Claire, Labour councillor for Leyland Central, claims deluded Danczuk believed he had a shot at a real relationship with Sophena.
It was just days ago that he confessed to messaging the teen.
Claire said: "Simon had been drinking most of the day, he'd had at least a bottle of wine. We'd been out for lunch but he blurted out 'I don't think we should be in a serious relationship'.
"He said he'd been messaging this teenage singer on Twitter when he was up late or couldn't sleep in the early hours about 'life and music and stuff '. I asked if the messages were friendly or intimate and why text someone so young? He wouldn't tell me or show me the messages."
Stunned, Claire told him to leave and find somewhere else to stay. He was saying 'I'm sorry, Claire, I'm sorry.' I packed his bag and gave him it. He was crying like a baby. I went on Twitter straight away and typed 'Danczuk dumped'. I didn't want to give myself any chance to go back - it was over, done.
"I felt emotionally drained that he was in touch with someone so young. He obviously thought he had a chance with her because he essentially wanted us to have an open relationship.
"Having now seen the texts, I feel physically stick to my stomach."
Just hours earlier the couple had Tweeted a picture of themselves enjoying a Boxing Day pub lunch while Danczuk's constituents in Rochdale were flooded.
He faced a barrage of criticism but Claire said he simply laughed it off. "He's a total embarrassment to Rochdale," she said.
"He enjoys being seen to be doing something positive and thrives on the attention it gets.
"He was in no hurry to get back to Rochdale to deal with the flood crisis. In fact, he spent two days doing radio interviews instead of helping."
Claire said Danczuk - who exposed the late Rochdale MP Sir Cyril Smith as a paedophile - knew he was at risk of being deselected by Labour before the texts scandal.
She said he had vowed to stand as an independent if his career was threatened, adding: "He said he would stand as an independent but not do any campaigning.
"He said he wanted to make sure Labour lost the seat he won for them."
Claire recalled the night out she shared with Danczuk and Karen, who is famed for her revealing selfie photos.
She said Danczuk persuaded her to pose for pictures that later appeared in the papers.
But Claire admits she added fuel to the fire - revealing she and Karen shared a kiss.
She said Danczuk took pictures of the embrace and she now fears they will get out. Claire added: "Simon had gone to the toilet and Karen started saying how she was bisexual and just kind of went in for the kill.
"We'd all had a lot to drink and I found myself responding. Next thing Simon was there taking pictures with his phone, laughing.
"I'm really worried those pictures will get out. I begged him to delete them, but he'd just laugh.
CLOSE
"He and Karen are incredibly close still, there's nothing romantic between them but they are kind of co-dependent on each other, probably because they are so similar. But I feel sorry for Karen. He's played both of us to boost his image."
Danczuk was Claire's first serious relationship since her partner left when their daughter, now two, was just four months old.
After meeting at the Labour conference in Brighton, she said Danczuk flattered her looks and bought her expensive gifts. Close to tears, Claire said: "The first month was fantastic. There were times he staged press pictures which made me uncomfortable but he said they would get photos so he might as well get paid for them.
"We were only together a week when he told me he loved me and after that he'd always write 'love you millions' in his text messages."
Claire said their first date was at an Indian restaurant. She said: "He was utterly charming, very funny and very complimentary."
They enjoyed cooking and liked to settle down in front of the TV. Claire added: "He preferred cosy nights in. He would take his contact lenses out, put on his glasses and charming Simon would appear.
"He was much nicer than MP Simon. I used to call him Specs Simon and he'd laugh. When things were great I was on a total high but when they were bad I was so low.
"Simon would get really abusive if stressed or drunk."
Their split followed a series of rows. She said he admitted a clinch with a 25-year-old activist, which she denies at a Christmas party - then accused her of flirting with another MP.
The worst bust-up came in London when Danczuk threatened to abandon her.
She said: "I was chasing him in my heels. I managed to persuade him to get us into a taxi. Next day he said he was sorry, but it was always the same when he'd had a drink.
"He'd be full of apologies and I'd forgive him. Deep down I knew he was being abusive. At the end of the day it was Simon's way or no way. Now he's getting what he deserves."
Claire's revelations came after Danczuk's first wife Sonia Rossington, 39, launched an attack on the MP, threatening to change their teenage daughter's surname to protect her from his "stupidity".
She also hinted she was planning a further bombshell revelation that could end his political career.
Last night Danczuk said of Claire: "She is consumed by bitterness, is susceptible to drinking too much and is telling lies."
He also said he did not wish to comment on Sophena, now 18. But days ago he admitted being "stupid" and acting "like an old fool".

YOU DIRTY OLD MAN!; 
Sexting MP's ex: I'll change child name to spare her humiliation

BYLINE: LAURA CONNER

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 20

LENGTH: 267 words

SIMON Danczuk's first wife has lashed out at the shamed MP for embarrassing their children by behaving like a "dirty old man".
Sonia Rossington, who divorced the MP in 2010 for his affair with Karen Danczuk who became his second wife, is now threatening to change their daughter's surname. 
Mr Danczuk, 49, said he had been an "old fool" for sending lewd messages to a 17-year-old girl. Talking about the messages, in which Mr Danczuk asked student Sophena Houlihan if she "wanted a spanking", Mrs Rossington said: "My God, what is he doing?
"He has a daughter not much younger than the girl he wants to 'spank', and his 18-year-old son has enough problems at university, sharing the Danczuk name.
"Why can he not think of his children and the devastating effect his selfish antics have on them? It has been one thing after another. Will it ever end? Will he ever stop and think about the damage he is doing to his children?"
Mr Danczuk and Mrs Rossington's marriage broke down after the scandal-hit MP fathered selfie queen Karen's child. They went on to have another child.
He is also the father of Mrs Rossington's 13-year-old daughter. story In her first text to Mr Danczuk in several years, Mrs Rossington, 40, of Darwen, Lancs, said: "If you resort to stripping yourself of any further dignity, I will change your daughter's surname, if only to protect her against your stupidity."
She added Mr Danczuk - a campaigner against children's sexual exploitation - will probably plot a "tear jerking TV interview".
He has now been suspended by the Labour Party, pending an investigation.

THE agony Noah Doyle and his family have had to endure since he was born is nothing short of heartbreaking.
And the fact the baby with such serious health issues wasn't automatically given a medical card is shocking and disgraceful.
Leo Varadkar should hang his head in shame after seeing how Adam Doyle was forced to go public about his son's condition and travel to the North on Christmas Day for vital equipment to feed him and keep him alive.
This scandal is not the first of its kind and unless the Government sorts out the shambolic HSE it won't be the last.

Won't be last time Joan gets that sinking feeling

BYLINE: PAT FLANAGAN

SECTION: Pg. 13

LENGTH: 717 words

IT was almost biblical that Labour leader Joan Burton should end up floundering in flood water on the last day of the year.
It was as if God said "let those who have persecuted my people by means of water so be punished by water".
If ever there was an omen it took place in Thomastown, Co Kilkenny, yesterday. 
Luckily the water was almost as shallow as her party's election promises and the Tanaiste wasn't swept away.
All that was damaged was her phone which added to the sense of divine intervention after her jibes about water protesters having smartphones.
Still, there's something karmic about an incident where the Irish water takes revenge on those responsible for creating the hated entity Irish Water with the sole purpose to make people pay for water in a country that's under water.
And so began the great flood of jokes which may have washed away Labour's chances at the next election.
King Neptune and Murph the seal to be charged with false imprisonment... walking the plank a month early... she was after floating voters... out of her depth in three inches of water... where was Alan Kelly at the time?
Apparently Joan moved to one side and the canoe capsized which is unlike her because even when swingeing cuts were imposed on the disabled she refused to rock the boat.
The day had started off so swimmingly for Labour with the announcement of the raising of the minimum wage to (EURO)9.15 - a real achievement for Business and Employment Minister Ged Nash.
But a storm was brewing and within minutes Admiral Burton had to let off a broadside at critics after it emerged she is paying her head of staff Edward Brophy (EURO)144,550 - almost (EURO)52,000 over the cap for advisers introduced by her Government.
He economic advisor Terry Quinn is on (EURO)114,424 even though the Coalition set a (EURO)92,672 ceiling in 2011.
The few cents raise in the minimum wage doesn't look so good when you hear about guys being paid huge amounts of cash to advise Burton as Social Protection Minister on cutting the dole to people under 25.
And sure they were worth every cent for valuable advice on the great idea of slashing the single parent payment to thousands of working women.
If those women were last night laughing their heads off at Admiral Burton politically drowning in three inches of water who could blame them? Mrs Burton yesterday
And therein lies Labour's problem: they are so far removed from the reality of people living ordinary lives they think we owe them something.
In Britain, the Labour party has suspended an MP who threatened to spank a 17-year old student.
The Irish version not only spanked an entire nation, they expect us to thank them for the spanking.
The last year was not kind to Labour which heads into a General Election as popular as a hedgehog in a condom factory and about as useful.
Fine Gael on the other hand have gone from strength-tostrength and, like some dark Star Wars villain, appear to feed off negative energy.
Enda Kenny could only be bothered to visit flood-ravaged communities after #wheresenda began to trend on Twitter but his handlers know it's unlikely to do him lasting damage.
They know this misery will be water under the bridge when he again promises to do away with the hated Universal Social Charge in the run-in to the election.
Party bosses even know his refusal to repeat an earlier pledge to end the trolley crisis doesn't matter because those looking for less USC and income tax have health insurance and won't be affected.
It's not only he broke his promise to "end the scandal of patients on trolleys" his policies made the crisis much worse but who wants to hear about sick people when Enda's offering cash for an extra holiday.
Across the water the Conservative party appear hell-bent on dismantling the National Health Service and hiving off the profitable bits to their pals.
Last week it was revealed top officials from Fine Gael met senior Tories and we're told they talked electoral strategy and didn't look for tips on how to dismantle a health service.
Joan Burton and Labour actually expect us to vote for them so they can go into another coalition with the Irish Conservative Party.
What took place yesterday might indeed have been divine intervention from a merciful God who believes we've suffered enough.
The water was almost as shallow as her promises

FATCAT BANKERS PROBE SCRAPPED; 
'Slap in face' after crash crisis EXCLUSIVE

BYLINE: GRAHAM HISCOTT

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 5

LENGTH: 370 words

A PROBE into dodgy dealing at fatcat banks has been quietly scrapped.
The Financial Conduct Authority's decision sparked fury, and was slammed as "a huge blow for taxpayers" and "a slap in the face for ordinary people". 
Early in 2015 the FCA announced plans to review banking's culture.
But now the idea has been dumped after the watchdog claimed other measures had come into force to clamp down on wrongdoers. The shock about-face comes after Chancellor George Osborne was accused of ousting FCA boss Martin Wheatley for being too tough on banks.
Labour MP John Mann called dumping the review "unacceptable", adding: "As far as we know the culture hasn't changed."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said: "This will be a huge blow to customers and taxpayers who are all still paying the price for the failed culture in banking."
Tory MP Mark Garnier, who sits on the Treasury select committee, questioned what pressure the Treasury had placed on the FCA. But the FCA insisted the Treasury had "no involvement" in its decision.
Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said: "Cosy decisions between the banks and politicians and a toothless regulator led us to one of the biggest financial crashes in living memory."
David Hillman, of the Robin Hood Tax campaign, added: "This is a slap in the face for ordinary people whose interests have once again been tossed aside."
Big banks have been hit with billions of fines for wrongdoing, including £26billion for the PPI scandal alone, and further big penalties are expected.
But only last week it emerged that five of the world's biggest investment banks had used clever accounting to pay no UK corporation tax last year.

FROM Batman v Superman to England versus Wales at Euro 2016; from superstar Adele's hugely anticipated live dates to the 'internet of things', here's everything to look forward to in 2016... It's gonna be a good one!
SOAPS
BY TV Writer SARA WALLIS
After the usual tidings of pain and misery in the soaps over Christmas, the residents of Walford, Weatherfield and Emmerdale will be hoping for some New Year cheer.
In Enders, Phil is knocking at death's door with cirrhosis of the liver, Stacey's postpartum psychosis intensifies, Kat is desperate to track down her long-lost son and there's bound to be trouble with the reappearance of Louise Mitchell. 
On the cobbles, a raid at the Bistro leaves Carla's life in the balance, there is shock and awe at returning old faces (Jenny Bradley and Pat Phelan - remember them?), but Tyrone and Fiz get good news about Hope.
Over in the Dales, Charity looms large as she's due out of prison soon and there'll be no rest for Rakesh and Priya as they struggle to cover up their DNA switch once Vanessa finds out who's the daddy.
SPORT
BY Chief Sports Writer DAVE KIDD
England will be commemorating 50 years of international football failure when they head to the Euro finals in France in June.
After what promises to be the most intriguing Premier League title race in years, Roy Hodgson's men face Wales in the group stage and also meet Russia and Slovakia before their inevitable defeat as soon as they face a worldclass team.
After that, Team GB heads to the Olympics in Rio in August, hoping they can achieve anything close to the modern record of 29 gold medals amassed in London four years earlier.
There's Ryder Cup golf in Minnesota in September and Lewis Hamilton bids for a third straight F1 world title.
British boxing has never been in better shape, with 10 world champs, including controversial heavyweight Tyson Fury - who could face domestic challenges from Anthony Joshua and David Haye.
CHALLENGE Joshua
TRAVEL
Y Travel Editor NIGEL THOMPSON
Fabulous new direct long-haul routes from the UK will give Brits holiday options like never before. My picks include Thomas Cook flying to Boston and Los Angeles from Manchester.
Thomson will also be flying to stunning locations - Sri Lanka and Cuba from Gatwick, and the Dominican Republic from Birmingham.
I'd also expect more adventurous Brits to try Iran now the Foreign Office has relaxed its travel advice and simplified e-visa regulations will make it easier to go to Vietnam and India. In the USA it's the centenary of the National Park Service, so what better time to visit the natural wonders of the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone or Yosemite?
For city breaks on the rise consider Porto, Palma and Reykjavik. Afloat, go with the flow for a boom in river cruising with 24 new vessels due in 2016.
The elephant in the room is terrorism and security.
Brits are generally pretty robust travellers but I suspect some will choose not to go overseas, giving staycations a further boost.
MUSIC
BY Mirror Music Critic
GAVIN MARTIN
The huge album 25 and nearcertain Brits success mean tickets for Adele's live shows in the spring will be the hottest of the season.
Taylor Swift and critics' fave Kendrick Lamar are likely to win big at the Grammys with Lamar playing Hyde Park alongside Florence Welch.
Dave Grohl, whose busted leg is better, will surely make good on last year's Glastonbury cancellation by the Foo Fighters.
And expect festival favourites Radiohead and Coldplay (their farewell tour, apparently/ hopefully) to also feature on the bill. And, if the family Eavis are third time lucky, Prince to finally make his Glasto debut.
Elton John will defy advanced years with an upbeat new album and hit filled summer shows.
Bajan bad girl Rihanna's Anti World tour in late June should be the one to really raise temperatures. And Led Zep legend Jimmy Page promises surprises on his solo return.
FASHION
BY Fashion & Beauty Director AMBER GRAAFLAND
So what's in store for spring/summer 2016? Well, if you thought the fashion pack was done with its 70s love affair, think again. There was an abundance of suede on the runway with Jonathan Saunders, Alberta Ferretti and Olivier Rousteing all showing soft buttery shades in pastels and brights.
Summer's Victoriana trend and Spanish influence will show a softer side with florals, puffy sleeves and ruffles making their way on to the high street.
If you needed any more motivation to join a gym in January then there's still a strong focus on the neck and shoulder area with the halter neck drop sleeve top picking up where the off-the-shoulder top left off. Not a good look if you have bingo wings.
If all this is scaring you, fear not. The white shirt is a massive trend and an easy wardrobe update.
And the flat mule is back too. Comfortable and stylish, we say 'Yes please' to this.
MOTORING
BY Motoring Editor COLIN GOODWIN
The Volkswagen scandal will gradually be forgotten by all but a few bureaucrats. Motorists have known for years that what makers say cars do to the gallon bears no relation to actual consumption. The campaign against diesels will likely continue with talk of a ban in cities and a scrappage scheme.
We'll see more systems paving the way towards selfdriving cars.
But it'll be many years before ones that drive in towns are on sale. However, some that take motorway decisions are on their way, including the Mercedes E-Class with an automatic lane-changing system.
Oh, and Lewis Hamilton will be F1 champ again.
BOOKS
BY Book Critic DEIRDRE O'BRIEN
The book year starts with a surprise - the January release of Pure Juliet by Stella Gibbons - the first of two 'forgotten manuscripts' by the late author of Cold Comfort Farm.
There's also a buzz about thrillers The Widow by Fiona Barton (Jan 14) and February's Palace of Treason - by ex-spy Jason Matthews, billed as "The book the CIA tried to ban". Conn Iggulden's fans will have mixed feelings about War of The Roses: The Final Installment - which ends the epic series in April. The hottest cookbook will come in June from Bake Off champ Nadiya Hussein.
FOOD &DRINK
BY Cookery Columnist NADIA SAWALHA
Spiralising your veg was the trend of 2015 but this year we'll be going loopy for leftovers with the mantra "throw nothing away". Expect a surge in stem-to rootcooking - using every last bit - such as keeping vegetable peelings to turn them into tasty crisps.
There are new superfoods on the block. Thanks to their liberal use on The Great British Bake Off, nutrient-packed golden berries from South America are tipped as a trend. We'll finally get bored of kale, so expect more seaweed.
Frozen ready-made cake batters that go straight into the oven mean even the laziest cook will be homebaking.
And with the Olympics in Rio, expect barbies galore plus a rise in Caipirinhas - Brazil's cocktail made from cachaca, ginger, sugar, limes, mint and loads of ice.
TOYS
BY Consumer Editor RUKI SAY ID
Blockbuster 2016 movies Captain America, Angry Birds and Ninja Turtles 2 will play a big part in this year's top toys. Merchandise from the films, out in May and June, is already tipped to be among the year's biggest sellers.
And of course, the Force will still be strong with Star Wars - especially with spin-off Rogue One out later this year. It's expected to dominate the toy charts with app-activated droid BB-8 and Kylo Ren's lightsaber.
Meanwhile, Toys R Us is gearing up for Lego's Nexo Knights, out in two weeks. The playsets centre on a TV show and app that feature a futuristic kingdom where five knights battle Jesto, the jester turned bad. And if Lego isn't your thing, try the new Barbie Spy Squad secret agent dolls and accessories.
Lastly, retro toys will make a comeback as Teletubbies say "Eh-oh" to a new generation.
TECHNOLOGY
BY Technology Editor SOPHIE CURTIS
2015 was the year the internet started being embedded in watches, lightbulbs and even baby monitors. This will continue with more everyday objects becoming part of the 'internet of things' - allowing you to control them from your smartphone. Of course, that means home security in 2016 will have to start defending against hackers.
This year will also see the launch of Apple's iPhone 7, said to have a sharper display and wireless charging. The second generation of the Apple Watch will also go on sale, with Android rivals including Samsung, Sony and LG also driving the wearable technology market. And with virtual reality headsets like Oculus Rift hitting the shelves, gaming will enter a new dimension.
FILMS
BY Mirror Film Critic DAVID EDWARDS
Fanboys will be in heaven with the release of Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice (March 25), starring Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill. Other superhero outings include Captain America: Civil War (April 29) and X-Men Apocalypse (May 19). At the other end of the scale, supervillains including The Joker and Harley Quinn will have their day in Suicide Squad (Aug 5).
Kids will also be well-catered for with cartoons including Ice Age: Collision Course (July 29), Steven Spielberg's take on Roald Dahl's The BFG (July 22) and the return of unlikely hero Po in Kung Fu Panda 3 (March 11).
Meanwhile, Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig and Chris Hemsworth star in a reboot of Ghostbusters (July 15) while old favourites get a modern twist with the likes of The Jungle Book (April 15), Alice Through The Looking Glass (May 27) and Pride And Prejudice And Zombies (Feb 11) all set to hit the big screen.
Sci-fi fans will get their fix with Independence Day: Resurgence (June 24), Star Trek Beyond (July 22) and the final instalment in the Divergent series, Allegiant (March 11).
And while the dust has barely settled on the seventh Star Wars movie, spin-off Rogue One (Dec 16) will tell the story of the Rebels who stole the plans for the Death Star.
CELEBRITIES
BY 3am Editor ASHLEIGH RAINBIRD
With Cara Delevingne focused on films there's room in fashion for a hot new face and when Kate Moss's sister Lottie turns 18 this month brands will fall over themselves to be associated with her.
All eyes will be on One Direction's solo careers when the remaining boys go their separate ways in March. Zayn Malik should be ready to release by spring, which means he'll pip Harry Styles to it. Expect Liam Payne to get in the studio with other people as he's a handy producer, while Louis Tomlinson is almost certain to be on a revamped X Factor panel. Niall Horan could take a year out.
If Bianca Del Rio enters Celebrity Big Brother, 2016 will belong to RuPaul's Drag Race star, who's already a huge hit on the club circuit.

TRYING to fix the culture of banking is almost impossible. It is something that has been ingrained for decades.
I'm not anti-banks but, having worked in the industry, I've seen how people have tried to change it. But you can't do it unless you rip up the rule book and start again. 
The FCA has simply passed the buck. For banks, it will be business as usual. While some banks are trying to do something about it, not enough is going on.
I was doing some consultancy work at a bank before Christmas. They have the same problems - star traders bossing people around, wanting to get the job done as quickly as possible.
There has been a look at pay packets and clawing back bonuses. It's a great idea but banks will get around it in a heartbeat.
There is a contempt for the regulators, and it's bad as it was back in my day.
You have to conclude that the scandals have worsened in the past 20 years since Barings. But a lot of money is paid to stay one step ahead of the authorities.
The supervision isn't as good as it could be. Banks have been very good at bending the rules for many, many years to ensure they profit as much as they possibly can. That is what the ultimate game is.
It is why, up to now, the finance industry has been able to pretty much write its own rule book.
Fines haven't worked. Perhaps some of the sentences handed out to Libor trader Tom Hayes and others will have an impact.
But you are almost looking for a new generation of bankers who have been brought up differently, then you might see some serious change.
Nick Leeson triggered the collapse of Barings bank in 1995 after losing £826million through illegal trades.

FEW MATRON; 
NHS has lost 1,200 senior nurses since the Tories came to power

A LOSS of 1,205 NHS matrons in five years could have a serious impact on patient safety, say top doctors.
And they fear hospitals now lack the level of experience on wards to cope with unprecedented demand for treatment. 
David Cameron has consistently pledged senior nurses should be at the heart of NHS care. But a Daily Mirror investigation shows that on his watch the number of matrons has plunged by a fifth.
The number of modern matrons - who oversee patient care on wards - fell from 4,802 to 3,919 between 2010 and 2015.
Community matrons - who organise care outside hospital - dropped from 1,536 to 1,214. The total number of NHS matrons in England has fallen from 6,338 to 5,133.
And, as the NHS tries to save £22billion, hospitals have slashed senior nursing posts or failed to replace those who are retiring.
Dr Clive Peedell, a cancer specialist and co-leader of the National Health Action party, said: "David Cameron says we have more nurses, but when it comes to the most experienced nursing staff, once again the real figures prove him wrong."
At Manchester's Salford Royal Hospital three years ago, the PM said: "People want to see a figure of authority on the ward. Call them a matron, a ward sister, or a team leader." And in April, during the election, he was pictured with matron Sandra Allen at Witney Community Hospital.
The public inquiry into the Stafford Hospital scandal also stressed the importance of matrons.
Dr Peedell added: "There's a growing gap between the Government's NHS pronouncements, and statistics and the reality on the ground.
"The Stafford Hospital debacle was the result of financial considerations taking precedence over patient care. We're seeing the same again and it is driven by the austerity ideology of this Government.
"We should have been implementing the lessons of the Francis report and investing in staff. Instead we are repeating the mistakes that led up to it."
Unions say the "big drop" in matron numbers puts "huge pressure" on junior nurses left to cope with more patients.
And The Royal College of Nursing believes senior nursing roles have "borne the brunt of workforce cuts" and led to a "dangerous loss of experience and skills".
Labour say the loss of matrons is "deeply worrying" and accuse the PM of losing control of the NHS "staffing crisis".
The Department of Health said: "There are 24,000 extra clinical staff including nearly 9,000 extra nurses since May 2010, but it is up to hospital leaders to decide for themselves the type of staff they need."
