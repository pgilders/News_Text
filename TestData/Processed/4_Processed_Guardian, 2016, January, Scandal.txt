As the Flint water crisis grows, we must demand more emails from Rick Snyder; 
The public needs to know what his office's role, if any, was in the decision to use the dangerously corrosive Flint river as a water source.

Curt Guyette.

 Governor Rick Snyder wants Michigan's citizens to believe he is being transparent and honest. After his administration shamefully mishandled the Flint water crisis and betrayed the public's trust, the desire now is to repair that relationship. But the steps he has taken thus far are woefully inadequate.
 Snyder, following through on a promise made on Tuesday, has released emails from 2014 and 2015. That, however, is not nearly enough. If he truly does desire to be transparent - in a state where the governor (and legislature) are exempt from the state's Freedom of Information Act law that other officials and state employees are subject to - he must release all  of the emails. 
 The public needs to know what his office's role, if any, was in the decision to use the dangerously corrosive Flint river in 2014 as the sole water supply for a city of 100,000 people, a majority of whom are African American, and many of whom are desperately poor.

 Every time the administration is asked about that role, Snyder's people keep trying to sidestep it. The question is, why? 
 In a videotaped interview with the ACLU of Michigan on 15 September, Howard Croft, who has since resigned from his job as Flint's director of public works, asserted that the decision to use the river came directly from the governor's office.
 If true, it is a damning indictment.
 It is one thing to admit, as Snyder does now, that he was slow to address the lead crisis because he didn't have accurate information when the disaster began to unfold in 2015. It is something else entirely to fully own responsibility by confessing that the tragedy would never have occurred had his administration done due diligence on the Flint river beforehand.
 Until now, much of the media's focus - a focus that is embarrassingly late in coming for the most part - has been on when Snyder first knew that Flint's water supply was contaminated by lead.

 As the result of Foia documents obtained by the ACLU of Michigan and Virginia Tech professor Marc Edwards, we already know much of what was going on over the nearly two years since the fateful switch to the river was made. 
 We know, for example, that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) began raising concerns about lead in Flint's water in February 2015. EPA whistleblower Miguel Del Toral leaked an internal memo, published by the ACLU and reported on by Michigan Radio in early July 2015, sounding the alarm about the potential for widespread lead contamination. 
 The extent of that poisoning was largely established by a research team led by Virginia Tech's professor Edwards. The scientist, who played a pivotal role in exposing the crisis, worked with Flint residents to conduct an independent test of the city's water last summer. They began posting on a newly-created website test results of disturbingly high lead levels in water throughout the city at the end of August 2015.

 Industry was also aware that there were problems with the water. It was reported in October 2014 that a General Motors plant in Flint received special dispensation to stop using river water and return to the Detroit system in October 2014. The reason was that water coming from Flint was corroding the engines being manufactured before they could make it out the door.
 Many residents were aware that the water was not safe. In 2014, people were instructed by city officials to boil their water because of the E coli that was in it; they were also exposed to dangerously high levels of a carcinogenic byproduct of the chlorine used in high amounts to try and kill bacteria in the water. The people of Flint began complaining about the color, smell and taste of their water as soon as the switch occurred nearly two years ago.
 Unless Snyder and his people were inhabiting caves for the past two years, they too should have known all of this as the scandal continued to unravel. At this point, all he is doing is admitting, finally, to the obvious.
 Which is why he needs to provide more information than he has offered so far. It is fine that Snyder shared his 2014 and 2015 emails. It will be interesting to see, what, if anything, they will reveal about events during that time frame.
 But what's crucial at this point is that people be allowed to see what was going on in his office in 2013, when the catastrophic decision to begin using the river was apparently being made. Until Snyder does that, any attempts to regain the public's trust are bound to fail.

BBC staff are still afraid to speak out, four years after Jimmy Savile's death; 
Dame Janet Smith's report shows how silence helped the star get away with abuse - and the continuing scandal is that staff remain afraid to blow the whistle.

Jane Martinson.

In all major sex abuse scandals - from Rotherham to the Catholic church as well as Jimmy Savile - the perpetrators are aided by a culture of silence. And the most searing indictment in the report into the BBC's handling of the Jimmy Savile abuse scandal is that this culture of silence continues. 
Decades after children who spoke out about abuse by Savile were bustled out of the studio, BBC employees still feel too scared to speak out about their workplace in case they lose their job or fail to get promoted, according to Dame Janet Smith's draft report. Extraordinarily, the draft report records that one teenager abused on camera was told it was "just Jimmy fooling about". 
Even after Savile's death, those who chose to talk to the officially sanctioned review did so in the main if they were allowed to remain anonymous. They spoke of their fear that they would suffer the consequences for doing so.
 Related:  Jimmy Savile report must 'stop abuse happening again' - BBC director general
This is the continuing scandal: nearly four years after Savile died and all those people whose lives he ruined were finally listened to, our state broadcaster, our beloved Auntie, still perpetuates a culture in which people are too afraid to speak out.
In the final lines of her draft summary, Dame Janet Smith suggests that while the abuse suffered in the 70s and 80s by children and young women, some of whom worked at the BBC, had at least led to child protection measures and some equality improvements, potential whistleblowers were even now more worried about losing their jobs. Short-term and freelance contracts meant a workforce "with little or no job security", which was even less likely to speak out about the behaviour of colleagues.
"I found that employee witnesses who were about to say something to the review that was even mildly critical of the BBC were extremely anxious to maintain their anonymity," she wrote. "These people were, and still are, afraid for their positions. Even with modern employment protection, people fear that, even if they do not lose their jobs, their promotion prospects will be blighted if they complain."
The BBC did commission the Good report into whistleblowing  which was published last summer and promised to learn the lessons of the past.
But then there remains the issue of celebrity. Savile, along with Stuart Hall, Rolf Harris and a string of other famous men, all behaved, and were treated by the BBC, as though they were above the law.
"A degree of misconduct by members of the talent would be tolerated by, for example, the producer of a programme," the draft report said. "It was important to keep the star of the show happy. The producers of programmes on which Savile worked did not ask him to stop his habit of wet kissing or licking the hands and arms of staff members to whom he was introduced. I am sure they would not have wished to upset the star of the show."
If anything the power of celebrity has become even greater in an age in which the media is struggling to earn as much as it once did as the internet fractures old complacencies. Talking about the perceived importance and power of such men, Smith wrote: "Until a complaint is made such people are likely to enjoy the confidence and approval of all those around them."
 Related:  Jimmy Savile abuse report: key points of the leaked draft
There might not be any suggestion that today's onscreen celebrities are engaged in criminal behaviour like Savile's. But a culture of fear allows all powerful male stars to get away with behaviour in their workplace that would at the very least be regarded as regrettable. 
Jeremy Clarkson may be a talented and charismatic TV presenter and producer. Yet the attack on a producer which eventually led to his unseemly departure last year followed a whole series of controversies mainly involving racist and misogynistic comments. 
The power of celebrity is not just problem for the BBC, and other broadcasters probably face similar issues. But it is the BBC that shielded so many of the abusers who have now made memories of the 1970s so grim.
The current director general has already talked of wanting to learn from the report and ensure that this sort of abuse never happens again. He can take some comfort from the fact that Smith largely exonerates the BBC for failing to uncover Savile's sexual deviancy. She also found that reports that the BBC corporately "knew all about Savile" were "inaccurate or unreliable".
It can only be hoped that, after so many horror stories and so much more awareness of abuse, we will never again as a nation watch a man abuse a child live in the box in our living rooms and think nothing of it. And where once women at the BBC suffered horrific harassment and sexual misconduct at work, Smith says the BBC "has now recognised the need for women to be respected in the workplace".
But if a culture of deference to celebrity is allowed to continue unabated, amid rising job insecurity, of course there could still be predatory child abusers "lurking undiscovered in the BBC". To be honest, they could be in any workplace.

Alexander Litvinenko murder: UK freezes assets of chief suspects - as it happened;

 The Russian embassy has posted this account of what ambassador Alexander Yakovenko told the foreign office during the meeting he was summoned to today:
1. We consider the Litvinenko case and the way it was disposed of a blatant provocation of the British authorities.
2. We will never accept anything arrived at in secret and based on the evidence not tested in an open court of law.
3. The length of time that it took to "close" this case in this way makes us to believe it to be a whitewash for British special services' institutional incompetence. 
4. We also noted that the British government suspended the coroner's inquest which was open for public and media and where the Investigative Committee of Russia took part as an interested person, in favor of the public enquiry, which in fact is secret, at the height of political tension with Russia over Ukraine in July 2014. We view it as an attempt to put additional pressure on Russia in connection with existing differences over a number of international issues.
5. For us it is absolutely unacceptable that the report concludes that the Russian state was in any way involved in the death of Mr Litvinenko on British soil.
6. This gross provocation of the British authorities cannot help hurting our bilateral relationship.

Here's a summary of what we know.

The former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko was probably murdered on the personal orders of Vladimir Putin, the UK public inquiry into his death has found. Sir Robert Owen the QC who conducted the inquiry said: "I have concluded the FSB operation to kill Mr Litvinenko was probably approved by Mr [Nikolai] Patrushev, then head of the FSB, and also by President Putin."
Marina Litvinenko, Alexander's widow, welcomed the report and called for the UK to impose sanctions on Russia. "It is unthinkable that the Prime Minister would do nothing in the face of the damning findings of Sir Robert Owen", she said. She said she was "very proud of British justice."
Ben Emmerson, Marina Litvinenko's barrister, said the poisoning was a "mini act of nuclear terrorism on the streets of London". He said it was inconceivable that Russian agents be allowed to stay in the UK.
Downing Street said the government would have to weigh up any further actions in light of the need to work with Russia on tackling Isis . But it said the report was "extremely disturbing".
Home Secretary Theresa May announced that asset freezes have been imposed on Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun the men found by Owen to have administered the radioactive polonium poison in Litvinenko's tea. She said she had written to the director of public prosecutions today "asking her to consider whether any further action should be taken.
Opposition MPs and some Tory backbenchers said the government's response didn't go far enough. Shadow home secretary Andy Burnham said the UK's response and "could send a dangerous signal to Russia that our response is too weak
Andrei Lugovoi, the former KGB agent turned Russian MP, dismissed the report as "absurd". He said: "The results released to today just show London's anti-Russian position once again".
Russia's foreign ministry said the report was "politically motivated." A spokeswoman said: "We regret that a purely criminal case has been politicised and has darkened the general atmosphere of our bilateral relations."
Russia's ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, was summoned to the foreign office over the inquiry's finding. He said the report was an attempt to "exert pressure on Russia due to differences over international issues."
That's it for now. There will be more news and analysis on Alexander Litvinenko section of the Guardian's site.

The foreign office minister David Liddington met the Russian Ambassador Alexander Yakovenko  to assert that Russia had demonstrated "a flagrant disregard for UK law, international law and standards of conduct, and the safety of UK citizens", writes Patrick Wintour. 
Liddington added the Russian's conduct "would further complicate bilateral relations, undermine trust, and damage Russia's reputation internationally."
Even though there is no prospect Russia will change its stance Liddington insisted it was unacceptable that Russia has not complied with the Crown Prosecution Service's formal request to extradite Lugovoy. 
Russia, Liddington said had "to provide answers to the questions raised by this report, to account for the actions of the Russian intelligence services in this case, and to provide an assurance that a similar crime would not be repeated."
In practice Britain will now be waiting to see if Russia imposes any counter measures, or instead decides to show its contempt for the allegations against Putin by simply ignoring the issue, and focussing on its support for President Assad in Syria. 
block-time published-time 2.11pm GMT 
Shadow home secretary Andy Burnham said the government's diplomatic response did not "go anywhere near enough in answering the seriousness of the findings", writes Patrick Wintou r.
Burham said the UK's response and "could send a dangerous signal to Russia that our response is too weak". He said the report was "one of the most shocking and disturbing reports ever presented to parliament"
He suggested the immediate expulsion of every FSB operative in the UK and strengthened economic sanctions.
The shadow home secretary at the time of the murder, David Davis ,said the report meant that in a civil UK court Putin would be found guilty of complicity in murder. He said "we need to go after the financial assets of Putin in the Bahamas and in Cyprus. Eventually you get to a point when with a dictator you have to draw a line as we did in the Thirties".
The former Labour culture secretary Ben Bradshaw said: "When is the government going to take meaningful action against the dirty Russian money and property here in London that sustains the Putin kleptocracy, and when is the government going to implement the will of this House - passed overwhelmingly in 2012 - in favour of a Magnitsky-type legislation".
Another former Labour shadow minister, Mary Creagh, urged the government to take action at the level of the United Nations Security Council, something that was rejected by May.
The SNP's Peter Grant said "The report I think leads to only one possible conclusion - we now have to regard the Russian government, the Russian state as an organisation actively involved in the commission, funding, supporting and directing acts of terrorism against UK citizens within the United Kingdom."

Shaun Walker in Moscow has more reaction from Russia, on much the same lines as before. 
Russia's ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, who has been summoned to the foreign office over the inquiry's findings, told Russian news agency RIA Novosti he believes the findings were "an attempt to exert pressure on Russia due to differences over international issues".
A statement from Russia's investigative committee, which has been accused of carrying out politicised investigations in a number of high-profile murders in Russia, including that of Boris Nemtsov last February, also lambasted the British inquiry.
"The guilty party had been determined from the start, and the inquiry was just set up to bring up some supposedly secret 'facts'. The very idea of a public inquiry with secret facts which can be manipulated in any way is absurd".
Putin himself has been chairing a meeting of Russia's science and education council this afternoon, and has not made any comment on the inquiry. His spokesman Dmitry Peskov has also not commented.
block-time published-time 1.52pm GMT 
In Sir Robert Owen's report under a section about possible motives for the murder, the QC points out that Litvinenko accused President Putin of being a paedophile.
It says: "Litvinenko made repeated highly personal attacks on President Putin, culminating in the allegation of paedophilia in July 2006."
The report carries this text from the article:
"A few days ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin walked from the Big Kremlin Palace to his Residence. At one of the Kremlin squares, the president stopped to chat with the tourists. Among them was a boy aged 4 or 5. 
"What is your name?' Putin asked. 'Nikita,' the boy replied. 
Putin knee[le]d, lifted the boy's T-shirt and kissed his stomach. 
The world public is shocked. Nobody can understand why the Russian president did such a strange thing as kissing the stomach of an unfamiliar small boy. 
The explanation may be found if we look carefully at the so-called 'blank spots' in Putin's biography. 
After graduating from the Andropov Institute, which prepares officers for the KGB intelligence service, Putin was not accepted into the foreign intelligence. Instead, he was sent to a junior position in KGB Leningrad Directorate. 
This was a very unusual twist for a career of an Andropov Institute's graduate with fluent German. Why did that happen with Putin? 
Because, shortly before his graduation, his bosses learned that Putin was a pedophile [sic]. So say some people who knew Putin as a student at the Institute. 
The Institute officials feared to report this to their own superiors, which would cause an unpleasant investigation. They decided it was easier just to avoid sending Putin abroad under some pretext. Such a solution is not unusual for the secret services.
Many years later, when Putin became the FSB director and was preparing for the presidency, he began to seek and destroy any compromising materials collected against him by the secret services over earlier years. It was not difficult, provided he himself was the FSB director. Among other things, Putin found videotapes in the FSB Internal Security directorate, which showed him making sex with some underage boys.
Interestingly, the video was recorded in the same conspiratorial flat in Polyanka Street in Moscow where Russian Prosecutor-General Yuri Skuratov was secretly video-taped with two prostitutes. Later, in the famous scandal, Putin (on Roman Abramovich's instructions) blackmailed Skuratov with these tapes and tried to persuade the Prosecutor-General to resign. In that conversation, Putin mentioned to Skuratov that he himself was also secretly video-taped making sex at the same bed. (But of course, he did not tell it was pedophilia [sic] rather than normal sex.) Later, Skuratov wrote about this in his book Variant Drakona (pp.153-154)." 
block-time published-time 1.43pm GMT 
Tory backbencher David Davis said the government's response did not go far enough. 
He said the findings of the report were "astonishing." Speaking to the World at One he said: "I do not know of a judicial inquiry which has ever come to the conclusion that a foreign head of state has probably authorised murder on the British streets."
Asked about the government's response he said: "It is in the right direction but it is not enough." He pointed out that Lugovoi and Kovtum were not leave Russia and have been rewarded by the Russian state. "So what we have done so far is gesture. I think we need to expel the intelligence officer at the Russian embassy here. And I think we need to take financial action against  Mr Patrushev and Mr Putin ." 
"You eventually get to the point with a dictator when you have to draw a line. It is a lesson we learnt in the 30s with Hitler."

One of Litvinenko's alleged killers sent a T-shirt bearing the words "nuclear death is knocking on your door" to Britain years after the dissident's death, PA notes. 
Lugovoi was said to have given the T-shirt to an associate in Moscow and asked for it be delivered as a "gift" to billionaire Boris Berezovsky, a friend of the poisoned spy, in 2010. 
The front of the black T-shirt had the words "POLONIUM-210 CSKA LONDON, HAMBURG To Be Continued", while "CSKA Moscow Nuclear Death Is Knocking Your Door" was printed on the back. 
 Sir Robert Owen's report said the writing was "in extraordinary terms". 
It said: "Taken on its own (and without, of course, the benefit of oral evidence from Mr Lugovoi), it would be difficult to know what to make of this T-shirt. 
"On any view, it demonstrates that Mr Lugovoi approved of Mr Litvinenko's murder. It was also, clearly, a threat to Mr Berezovsky. 
"Further than that, the T-shirt could be seen as an admission by Mr Lugovoi that he had poisoned Mr Litvinenko, made at a time when he was confident that he would never be extradited from Russia, and wished to taunt Mr Berezovsky with that fact. "Alternatively, it could, perhaps, be seen as an extraordinarily tasteless joke." 
Berezovsky died at his Berkshire home in 2013.

 Theresa May's statement - Summary  
Here are the main points from Theresa Ma y's statement.
As others have said, in rhetorical terms it was robust. But May's combative language distracted attention from the lack of substance in what she was announcing. The practical measures she unveiled in retaliation against Russia were minimal.
Here are the main points.

May accused Russia of "a blatant and unacceptable breach of the most fundamental tenets of international law and of civilised behaviour".
The Government takes these findings extremely seriously - as I am sure does every member of this House. We are carefully considering the report's findings in detail, and their implications. In particular, the conclusion that the Russian state was probably involved in the murder of Mr Litvinenko is deeply disturbing. It goes without saying that this was a blatant and unacceptable breach of the most fundamental tenets of international law and of civilised behaviour. But we have to accept this does not come as a surprise. The Inquiry confirms the assessment of successive governments that this was a state sponsored act. This assessment has informed the Government's approach to date. 

She said the government was imposing new asset freezes on Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovturn, the two killers.
In light of the report's findings the Government will go further, and Treasury Ministers have today agreed to put in place asset freezes against the two individuals. 

She said she had written to the director of public prosecutions today "asking her to consider whether any further action should be taken, both in terms of extradition and freezing criminal assets".

She said the government was protesting to Russia "in the strongest possible terms".
We have always made our position clear to the Russian government and in the strongest possible terms and we are doing so again today. We are making senior representations to the Russian Government in Moscow. And at the same time we will be summoning the Russian Ambassador in London to the Foreign Office, where we will express our profound displeasure at Russia's failure to co-operate and provide satisfactory answers. Specifically, we have, and will continue to demand that the Russian Government account for the role of the FSB in this case.

She said the government was warning its international allies about Russia.
This Government is clear that we must protect the UK and her interests from Russia- based threats, working closely with our allies in the EU and NATO. This morning I have written to my counterparts in EU, NATO and 5 Eyes countries drawing their attention to both the report and the need to take steps to prevent such a murder being committed on their streets. 

She said today's measures were in addition to action already taken by the government since 2007.
Since 2007 that approach has comprised a series of steps to respond to Russia and its provovation. Some of these measures were immediate, such as the expulsion of a number of Russian embassy officials from the UK. Others are ongoing, such as the tightening of visa restrictions on Russian officials in the UK. The Metropolitan Police Service's investigation into Mr Litvinenko's murder remains open. And I can tell the House today Interpol notices and European Arrest Warrants are in place so that the main suspects, Andrey Lugovoy and Dmitri Kovtun, can be arrested if they travel abroad.

As is their usual dynamic, Andrei Lugovoi has been giving plenty of comment to Russian news agencies on the British inquiry, while the man named as his accomplice in the poisoning, Dmitry Kovtun, has been staying quiet.
Since the murder, Lugovoi has led a public life, as an MP for a nationalist party and outspoken critic of the west, while Kovtun is rarely seen in public. Kovtun told Interfax on Thursday he did not want to comment until he had the chance to read the report thoroughly.

Putin's regime has killed more than 100 opponents, he says. What will be done about Putin and Nikolai Patrushev? Will FSB officers be expelled from London? And what action will be taken to freeze Russian bank accounts around the world?
May says she said in her statement that the findings about Russian state involvement were no surprise.

 Summary  
Here's a summary of what we know:

The former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko was probably murdered on the personal orders of Vladimir Putin, the UK public inquiry into his death has found. Sir Robert Owen the QC who conducted the inquiry said: "I have concluded the FSB operation to kill Mr Litvinenko was probably approved by Mr [Nikolai] Patrushev, then head of the FSB, and also by President Putin."
Marina Litvinenko, Alexander's widow, welcomed the report and called for the UK to impose sanctions on Russia. "It is unthinkable that the Prime Minister would do nothing in the face of the damning findings of Sir Robert Owen", she said.
Downing Street said the government would have to weigh up any further actions in light of the need to work with Russia on tackling Isis. But it said the report was "extremely disturbing".
Home Secretary Theresa May announced that asset freezes have been imposed on Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun the men found by Owen to have administered the radioactive polonium poison in Litvinenko's tea. She also told the Commons that Russia's ambassador to the UK has been summoned.
Andrei Lugovoi, the former KGB agent turned Russian MP, dismissed the report as "absurd". He said: "The results released to today just show London's anti-Russian position once again".
Russia's foreign ministry said the report was "politically motivated." A spokeswoman said: "We regret that a purely criminal case has been politicised and has darkened the general atmosphere of our bilateral relations."

May is responding to Burnham.
She says she would be happy to meet Marina Litvinenko.
On the subject of a Magnitsky Act, she says the government has a number of actions that can be taken. But the government wants Lugovoi and Kovtun to come to the UK so they can face justice. It does not want them to be excluded.
If they travel outside Russia, there are warrants in place that would led to their being arrested.
She says David Cameron will raise this with Putin at the next available opportunity.
The UK has been leading on sanctions against Russia in the EU, she says.
She says she wants to see justice for the family.

 Andy Burnham, the shadow home secretary, is responding on behalf of Labour.
He says this is one of the most "shocking and disturbing" reports presented to parliament. It reveals an "unprecedented act of state sponsored terrorism that must be met with a commensurate response".
He says the government should ask its allies to cooperate with Britain in trying to extradite Lugovoi and Kovtun.
He asks if the security of other Russians in the UK who could be at risk has been reviewed.
He says Marina Litvinenko has a list of people who helped Lugovoi and Kovtun. Will the government consider sanctions on people on this list, affecting their travel, their property and their assets?
Will the government consider the case for a Magnitsky Act?
Has the prime minister raised this case with Vladimir Putin?
Burnham asks about parliament's relationship with the Russian parliament.
He says the government should consider expelling all FSB officers from Britain.
And he says the government should now consider the case for trying to stop the World Cup being held in Russia in 2018. 
Burnham recalls Litvinenko's last words to his son; he said he should defend Britain to his last breath.

Earlier in the Commons  Chris Bryant, the shadow leader of the Commons, and a persistent critic of Putin's Russia, urged the government to implement a Magnitsky Act. He said:
Of course I fully understand why the government wants to engage with Russia, she is a key player in Iran and in Syria. 
But the one thing we know for certain about the murderous kleptomaniac regime in Russia is that it walks all over the weak. 
Putin has no respect for those who let him do what he wants. 
On March 7 2012 this House declared unanimously that it wanted the government to introduce a Magnitsky Act, ensuring that nobody involved in the murder of Sergei Magnitsky or the corruption that he unveiled should be able to enter this country. 
The USA has such an act - is it not time that we made absolutely clear that Russian murderers are not welcome in this country and that the likes of Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitri Kovtun can only enter the country if they are prepared to stand trial?"

Yesterday I spoke to Viktor Ivanov, a close Putin ally who had been implicated in ordering the hit by lawyers for Marina Litvinenko during the inquiry, writes Shaun Walker.
He was angry and said the inquiry had not contacted him to give evidence.
The report finds that a damning report Litvinenko wrote into Ivanov's background, which may have found its way back into his hands, was drafted too soon before the operation began to kill him to have served as the trigger for the assassination.
"I do not therefore think that either of these matters was a fundamental cause of the decision to kill Mr Litvinenko," says page 228 of the report. However, the judge concluded that there is a possibility that "these considerations may have provided extra motivation and impetus to a plan that had already been conceived.
block-time published-time 11.09am GMT 
We have already heard that there will be "serious consequences" for bilateral relationship with Britain, but any Russian actions are likely to be calibrated according to how tough Britain's political response to the inquiry's findings turns out to be, writes Shaun Walker in Moscow. 
We can expect some aggressive rhetoric over the "illegitimate" and "politicised" nature of the hearing today, but the ideal outcome for Moscow will be to brush the results under the carpet. Moscow is already under sanctions for its actions in Crimea and Ukraine, and has no appetite to get into another round of reciprocal measures. However, if London does decide the allegations are so serious that there has to be a robust response, we can expect indignation and some kind of symmetrical action from Moscow.
While the inquiry was clear that Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun carried out the attack with the backing of the Russian state, for now the Russian focus is likely to be on the inquiry's formulation that the hit was "probably" ordered by Vladimir Putin and the lack of any certain conclusions as to who ordered the hit.
Numerous officials have told me they believe the inquiry to be a purely politicised process, and the first official responses we have been hearing from the foreign ministry and other official sources are taking the same line today.
The new British ambassador in Moscow, Laurie Bristow, arrived in Russia just ten days ago, and has a challenging start to his tenure. With Britain eager to keep contacts with Russia over Syria and other issues, he is likely to be working to smooth over the effects of the report with various Russian contacts.

"All the evidence points in one direction namely that when they [Lugovoi and Kovtun] killed Mr Litvinenko they were acting on behalf of someone else. I have concluded that there is a strong probability that when Mr Lugovoi poisoned Mr Litvinenko he did so under the direction of the FSB - the Federal Security Service of the Russia Federation...

 Russia dismisses report as 'politically motivated'  
Russia's foreign ministry has dismissed the inquiry as "politically motivated" and complained that it lacked transparency.
Maria Zakharova, spokeswoman for the Russian foreign ministry, gave this statement translated by Shaun Walker. 
Of course we need time to carefully study this document, after which we'll give a proper evaluation.
However, I can say that the Russian position on this issue is well known and unchanged. We regret that a purely criminal case has been politicised and has darkened the general atmosphere of our bilateral relations. It's obvious that the decision to end the coroner's investigation and start the public hearing had a clear political subtext. The process, despite its name, was not transparent either for Russia or for the general public, given the fact that some material was heard in closed session under the pretext of its secret nature.
Taking this into account, there was little grounds to expect that the final report of a process that was politically motivated and highly opaque, and prepared with a pre-determined "correct" result in mind, would suddenly turn out to be objective and balanced.

The report is is unlikely to have a significant impact on bilateral relations or on UK policy towards Russia, according to Alex Nice, analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. 
A few years ago, during the period of the US "reset" when much of the West was trying to rebuild relations with Russia, the findings of the inquiry could have put the UK government in an awkward position. Indeed, this may be why the inquiry was delayed for so many years. But relations are now so bad that it is difficult to see how this will have a major impact. Once the UK had imposed sanctions on Russia over Ukraine, the diplomatic risks of publicly accusing the Kremlin of murder were much reduced. Having said that, the argument that the UK should try to "re-engage" with Russia will inevitably return at some point. When that happens, the Litvenenko findings will strengthen the case of the sceptics.

The report says the operation to kill Litvinenko was probably approved by Nikolai Patrushev and President Putin. 
Shaun Walker has more on Patrushev. 
Nikolai Patrushev is one of the key figures in Putin's system; he is one of many close to the Russian president who came through the ranks of the KGB in Leningrad, like Putin himself. 
Patrushev succeeded Putin as head of the FSB when Putin left in 1999 to become prime minister, and held the post for nearly a decade. In 2008, he was replaced and became head of Russia's security council. He rarely makes public appearances but is known for hawkish statements on Nato and the west. He remains one of the few people with close, frequent access to Putin.
We published this interview with him last year. 
Marina Litvinenko said travel bans and asset freezes should be imposed on Patrushev as well as Putin.

Andrei Lugovoi is reported to have dismissed the report as "absurd". 
Owen's report said: "I am sure that Mr Lugovoi and Mr Kovtun placed the polonium 210 in the teapot at the Pine Bar on 1 November 2006".
It added that it was "probable" Lugovoi poisoned Litvinenko under direction from the FSB, with Dmitry Kovtun "also acting under FSB direction". 
Lugovoi, who is now an MP with a nationalist political party, said: "The allegations against me are absurd," writes Shaun Walker. 
He added: "As we expected, there was no sensation. The results released to today just show London's anti-Russian position once again; the narrow-mindedness and lack of desire among the British to find the real reason for the death of Litvinenko."
"The 2014 events in Ukraine, which coincided with the resumption of the investigation into the Litvinenko case even though previously it had been declared secret, look like a pathetic attempt by London to use a 'skeleton in the cupboard' to support their political ambitions.

Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme he said: "Our reaction was that it was likely to have been authorised at quite a high level in the Russian system because they wouldn't do something so potentially damaging for a major power without high authorisation. 
But at my time there was no slam-dunk proof and I think it's quite unlikely any real evidence has turned up as to where the authorisation has come from." 
Brenton said that while the UK must react "strongly" to the murder, "tearing up" diplomatic relations with Russia was "not in Britain's interests".

Welcome to live coverage of the publication of the results of the public inquiry into the polonium poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko.
Here's the start of Luke Harding's curtain raiser to the publication of the hearing : 
Almost 10 years after he drank a cup of poisoned green tea in a Mayfair bar, the report into the murder of Alexander Litvinenko is due to be published, amid strong signs that the British government is reluctant to impose further sanctions on Russia.
The report will be released at 9.35am on Thursday, with Theresa May making a statement to parliament soon after. Litvinenko's widow, Marina, who received a copy of the report on Wednesday morning, will give her reaction at a press conference with her barrister, Ben Emmerson QC, and solicitor, Elena Tsirlina.
David Cameron received the report, which follows a public inquiry chaired by high court judge Sir Robert Owen, on Tuesday. It is widely believed that Owen will conclude that Litvinenko - who died in November 2006 after sipping radioactive polonium - was the victim of a Russian state assassination.
If, as expected, the Kremlin is blamed directly, Litvinenko's widow will demand a firm response from Downing Street. She is likely to call for fresh sanctions to be imposed on Russian politicians involved in the murder, as well as against state entities - a tough line that is also backed by the Liberal Democrats.
Last year, Emmerson described Litvinenko as the victim of a "state-sponsored act of nuclear terrorism" on the streets of London, adding that "the trail of polonium led directly to the door of Vladimir Putin's office". Emmerson dubbed the Russian president "a common criminal dressed up as a head of state."
At the time of his murder Litvinenko was a British citizen - and a part-time MI6 spy. Marina Litvinenko is understood to view the report as a major test for Cameron. The government's response, she believes, will show whether Downing Street is tough on all forms of terrorism, or only tough on terrorism carried out by non-state groups.
Luke has also put together a guide to six of the key players: Andrei Lugovoi, Marina Litvinenko, Sir Robert Owen, Dmitry Kovtun, Ben Emmerson and Vladimir Putin.

And here are six key questions for the inquiry to answer:

Who was responsible for Litvinenko's murder?
Did Putin order Litvinenko's death?
Might the two Russians charged with the murder - Dmitry Kovtun and Andrei Lugovoi - be innocent?
Should MI6 have done more to protect Litvinenko, a British agent?
Will Lugovoi and Kovtun ever go on trial?
What was the motive?

Jimmy Savile report must 'stop abuse happening again' - BBC director general; 
Tony Hall admits child abuse scandal was 'dark chapter in history of BBC' after early draft of review is released to the mediaKey points of the leaked draft report.

Jasper Jackson.

The Jimmy Savile child abuse scandal was a "dark chapter in the history of the BBC", the corporation's director general has admitted after a highly critical report into the entertainer's treatment was leaked.  
Tony Hall said the corporation will use Dame Janet Smith's report into sexual abuse by Savile to make sure nothing like it happens again, after key sections from an early draft appeared to show serious failings at the BBC. 
He added that the BBC could not act until the final version of the report was released and called for this to be done as swiftly as possible.
Hall said: "Dame Janet Smith's report will be invaluable in helping us understand what happened and to help ensure that we do everything possible to avoid it happening again."
 Related:  Jimmy Savile abuse report: key points of the leaked draft
In a statement, he said: "The review has said that the copy leaked to the media is an early draft which has changed considerably, so while I am impatient to learn those lessons the responsible thing must be to act on the final report, which we have not received."
He added: "The review expects the report to be published within six weeks and we hope it will be published as swiftly as possible."
A statement from the BBC Trust chair, Rona Fairhead, said it would be premature to comment before the full version was published, but promised to ensure the BBC took action on its findings. 
"We will provide every possible assistance to enable swift publication, and make sure the BBC takes all appropriate action to address the report's conclusions," she said.
Responding to the leak on Thursday morning, Smith said the "document is out of date and significant changes have been made to its contents and conclusions. The document should not have been made public and cannot be relied upon in any circumstances."
 Chapters from the draft, including its conclusion, were leaked to investigative news website Exaro, which published extracts on Wednesday night. The draft, dating back more than a year, suggests the report will detail Savile's abuse of children at "virtually every one of the BBC premises at which he worked".
It outlines multiple rapes and indecent assaults by Savile, which she claims were all "in some way associated with the BBC". In one case a girl who complained was escorted off the premises.

Shaun Walker in Moscow has more reaction from Russia, on much the same lines as before. 
Russia's ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, who has been summoned to the foreign office over the inquiry's findings, told Russian news agency RIA Novosti he believes the findings were "an attempt to exert pressure on Russia due to differences over international issues".
A statement from Russia's investigative committee, which has been accused of carrying out politicised investigations in a number of high-profile murders in Russia, including that of Boris Nemtsov last February, also lambasted the British inquiry. 
"The guilty party had been determined from the start, and the inquiry was just set up to bring up some supposedly secret 'facts'. The very idea of a public inquiry with secret facts which can be manipulated in any way is absurd".
Putin himself has been chairing a meeting of Russia's science and education council this afternoon, and has not made any comment on the inquiry. His spokesman Dmitry Peskov has also not commented.
block-time published-time 1.52pm GMT 
In Sir Robert Owen's report under a section about possible motives for the murder, the QC points out that Litvinenko accused President Putin of being a paedophile.
It says: "Litvinenko made repeated highly personal attacks on President Putin, culminating in the allegation of paedophilia in July 2006."
The report carries this text from the article:
"A few days ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin walked from the Big Kremlin Palace to his Residence. At one of the Kremlin squares, the president stopped to chat with the tourists. Among them was a boy aged 4 or 5. 
"What is your name?' Putin asked. 'Nikita,' the boy replied. 
Putin knee[le]d, lifted the boy's T-shirt and kissed his stomach. 
The world public is shocked. Nobody can understand why the Russian president did such a strange thing as kissing the stomach of an unfamiliar small boy. 
The explanation may be found if we look carefully at the so-called 'blank spots' in Putin's biography. 
After graduating from the Andropov Institute, which prepares officers for the KGB intelligence service, Putin was not accepted into the foreign intelligence. Instead, he was sent to a junior position in KGB Leningrad Directorate. 
This was a very unusual twist for a career of an Andropov Institute's graduate with fluent German. Why did that happen with Putin? 
Because, shortly before his graduation, his bosses learned that Putin was a pedophile [sic]. So say some people who knew Putin as a student at the Institute. 
The Institute officials feared to report this to their own superiors, which would cause an unpleasant investigation. They decided it was easier just to avoid sending Putin abroad under some pretext. Such a solution is not unusual for the secret services.
Many years later, when Putin became the FSB director and was preparing for the presidency, he began to seek and destroy any compromising materials collected against him by the secret services over earlier years. It was not difficult, provided he himself was the FSB director. Among other things, Putin found videotapes in the FSB Internal Security directorate, which showed him making sex with some underage boys.
Interestingly, the video was recorded in the same conspiratorial flat in Polyanka Street in Moscow where Russian Prosecutor-General Yuri Skuratov was secretly video-taped with two prostitutes. Later, in the famous scandal, Putin (on Roman Abramovich's instructions) blackmailed Skuratov with these tapes and tried to persuade the Prosecutor-General to resign. In that conversation, Putin mentioned to Skuratov that he himself was also secretly video-taped making sex at the same bed. (But of course, he did not tell it was pedophilia [sic] rather than normal sex.) Later, Skuratov wrote about this in his book Variant Drakona (pp.153-154)."

Tory backbencher David Davis said the government's response did not go far enough. 
He said the findings of the report were "astonishing." Speaking to the World at One he said: "I do not know of a judicial inquiry which has ever come to the conclusion that a foreign head of state has probably authorised murder on the British streets."
Asked about the government's response he said: "It is in the right direction but it is not enough." He pointed out that Lugovoi and Kovtum were not leave Russia and have been rewarded by the Russian state. "So what we have done so far is gesture. I think we need to expel the intelligence officer at the Russian embassy here. And I think we need to take financial action against  Mr Patrushev and Mr Putin ." 
"You eventually get to the point with a dictator when you have to draw a line. It is a lesson we learnt in the 30s with Hitler."

One of Litvinenko's alleged killers sent a T-shirt bearing the words "nuclear death is knocking on your door" to Britain years after the dissident's death, PA notes. 
Lugovoi was said to have given the T-shirt to an associate in Moscow and asked for it be delivered as a "gift" to billionaire Boris Berezovsky, a friend of the poisoned spy, in 2010. 
The front of the black T-shirt had the words "POLONIUM-210 CSKA LONDON, HAMBURG To Be Continued", while "CSKA Moscow Nuclear Death Is Knocking Your Door" was printed on the back. 
 Sir Robert Owen's report said the writing was "in extraordinary terms". 
It said: "Taken on its own (and without, of course, the benefit of oral evidence from Mr Lugovoi), it would be difficult to know what to make of this T-shirt. 
"On any view, it demonstrates that Mr Lugovoi approved of Mr Litvinenko's murder. It was also, clearly, a threat to Mr Berezovsky. 
"Further than that, the T-shirt could be seen as an admission by Mr Lugovoi that he had poisoned Mr Litvinenko, made at a time when he was confident that he would never be extradited from Russia, and wished to taunt Mr Berezovsky with that fact. "Alternatively, it could, perhaps, be seen as an extraordinarily tasteless joke." 
Berezovsky died at his Berkshire home in 2013.

 Theresa May's statement - Summary  
Here are the main points from Theresa Ma y's statement.
As others have said, in rhetorical terms it was robust. But May's combative language distracted attention from the lack of substance in what she was announcing. The practical measures she unveiled in retaliation against Russia were minimal.
Here are the main points.

May accused Russia of "a blatant and unacceptable breach of the most fundamental tenets of international law and of civilised behaviour".
The Government takes these findings extremely seriously - as I am sure does every member of this House. We are carefully considering the report's findings in detail, and their implications. In particular, the conclusion that the Russian state was probably involved in the murder of Mr Litvinenko is deeply disturbing. It goes without saying that this was a blatant and unacceptable breach of the most fundamental tenets of international law and of civilised behaviour. But we have to accept this does not come as a surprise. The Inquiry confirms the assessment of successive governments that this was a state sponsored act. This assessment has informed the Government's approach to date. 

She said the government was imposing new asset freezes on Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovturn, the two killers.
In light of the report's findings the Government will go further, and Treasury Ministers have today agreed to put in place asset freezes against the two individuals. 

She said she had written to the director of public prosecutions today "asking her to consider whether any further action should be taken, both in terms of extradition and freezing criminal assets".

She said the government was protesting to Russia "in the strongest possible terms".
We have always made our position clear to the Russian government and in the strongest possible terms and we are doing so again today. We are making senior representations to the Russian Government in Moscow. And at the same time we will be summoning the Russian Ambassador in London to the Foreign Office, where we will express our profound displeasure at Russia's failure to co-operate and provide satisfactory answers. Specifically, we have, and will continue to demand that the Russian Government account for the role of the FSB in this case.

She said the government was warning its international allies about Russia.
This Government is clear that we must protect the UK and her interests from Russia- based threats, working closely with our allies in the EU and NATO. This morning I have written to my counterparts in EU, NATO and 5 Eyes countries drawing their attention to both the report and the need to take steps to prevent such a murder being committed on their streets. 

She said today's measures were in addition to action already taken by the government since 2007.
Since 2007 that approach has comprised a series of steps to respond to Russia and its provovation. Some of these measures were immediate, such as the expulsion of a number of Russian embassy officials from the UK. Others are ongoing, such as the tightening of visa restrictions on Russian officials in the UK. The Metropolitan Police Service's investigation into Mr Litvinenko's murder remains open. And I can tell the House today Interpol notices and European Arrest Warrants are in place so that the main suspects, Andrey Lugovoy and Dmitri Kovtun, can be arrested if they travel abroad. 
Matthew is taking over the blog again now.

Since the murder, Lugovoi has led a public life, as an MP for a nationalist party and outspoken critic of the west, while Kovtun is rarely seen in public. Kovtun told Interfax on Thursday he did not want to comment until he had the chance to read the report thoroughly.

 Summary  
Here's a summary of what we know:

The former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko was probably murdered on the personal orders of Vladimir Putin, the UK public inquiry into his death has found. Sir Robert Owen the QC who conducted the inquiry said: "I have concluded the FSB operation to kill Mr Litvinenko was probably approved by Mr [Nikolai] Patrushev, then head of the FSB, and also by President Putin."
Marina Litvinenko, Alexander's widow, welcomed the report and called for the UK to impose sanctions on Russia. "It is unthinkable that the Prime Minister would do nothing in the face of the damning findings of Sir Robert Owen", she said.
Downing Street said the government would have to weigh up any further actions in light of the need to work with Russia on tackling Isis. But it said the report was "extremely disturbing".
Home Secretary Theresa May announced that asset freezes have been imposed on Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun the men found by Owen to have administered the radioactive polonium poison in Litvinenko's tea. She also told the Commons that Russia's ambassador to the UK has been summoned.
Andrei Lugovoi, the former KGB agent turned Russian MP, dismissed the report as "absurd". He said: "The results released to today just show London's anti-Russian position once again".
Russia's foreign ministry said the report was "politically motivated." A spokeswoman said: "We regret that a purely criminal case has been politicised and has darkened the general atmosphere of our bilateral relations."

May is responding to Burnham.
She says she would be happy to meet Marina Litvinenko.
On the subject of a Magnitsky Act, she says the government has a number of actions that can be taken. But the government wants Lugovoi and Kovtun to come to the UK so they can face justice. It does not want them to be excluded.
If they travel outside Russia, there are warrants in place that would led to their being arrested.
She says David Cameron will raise this with Putin at the next available opportunity.
The UK has been leading on sanctions against Russia in the EU, she says.

He says this is one of the most "shocking and disturbing" reports presented to parliament. It reveals an "unprecedented act of state sponsored terrorism that must be met with a commensurate response".
He says the government should ask its allies to cooperate with Britain in trying to extradite Lugovoi and Kovtun.
He asks if the security of other Russians in the UK who could be at risk has been reviewed.
He says Marina Litvinenko has a list of people who helped Lugovoi and Kovtun. Will the government consider sanctions on people on this list, affecting their travel, their property and their assets?
Will the government consider the case for a Magnitsky Act?
Has the prime minister raised this case with Vladimir Putin?
Burnham asks about parliament's relationship with the Russian parliament.
He says the government should consider expelling all FSB officers from Britain.
And he says the government should now consider the case for trying to stop the World Cup being held in Russia in 2018. 
Burnham recalls Litvinenko's last words to his son; he said he should defend Britain to his last breath.

Earlier in the Commons  Chris Bryant, the shadow leader of the Commons, and a persistent critic of Putin's Russia, urged the government to implement a Magnitsky Act. He said:
Of course I fully understand why the government wants to engage with Russia, she is a key player in Iran and in Syria. 
But the one thing we know for certain about the murderous kleptomaniac regime in Russia is that it walks all over the weak. 
Putin has no respect for those who let him do what he wants. 
On March 7 2012 this House declared unanimously that it wanted the government to introduce a Magnitsky Act, ensuring that nobody involved in the murder of Sergei Magnitsky or the corruption that he unveiled should be able to enter this country. 
The USA has such an act - is it not time that we made absolutely clear that Russian murderers are not welcome in this country and that the likes of Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitri Kovtun can only enter the country if they are prepared to stand trial?"

Yesterday I spoke to Viktor Ivanov, a close Putin ally who had been implicated in ordering the hit by lawyers for Marina Litvinenko during the inquiry, writes Shaun Walker.
He was angry and said the inquiry had not contacted him to give evidence.
The report finds that a damning report Litvinenko wrote into Ivanov's background, which may have found its way back into his hands, was drafted too soon before the operation began to kill him to have served as the trigger for the assassination.
"I do not therefore think that either of these matters was a fundamental cause of the decision to kill Mr Litvinenko," says page 228 of the report. However, the judge concluded that there is a possibility that "these considerations may have provided extra motivation and impetus to a plan that had already been conceived.
block-time published-time 11.09am GMT 
We have already heard that there will be "serious consequences" for bilateral relationship with Britain, but any Russian actions are likely to be calibrated according to how tough Britain's political response to the inquiry's findings turns out to be, writes Shaun Walker in Moscow. 
We can expect some aggressive rhetoric over the "illegitimate" and "politicised" nature of the hearing today, but the ideal outcome for Moscow will be to brush the results under the carpet. Moscow is already under sanctions for its actions in Crimea and Ukraine, and has no appetite to get into another round of reciprocal measures. However, if London does decide the allegations are so serious that there has to be a robust response, we can expect indignation and some kind of symmetrical action from Moscow.
While the inquiry was clear that Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun carried out the attack with the backing of the Russian state, for now the Russian focus is likely to be on the inquiry's formulation that the hit was "probably" ordered by Vladimir Putin and the lack of any certain conclusions as to who ordered the hit.
Numerous officials have told me they believe the inquiry to be a purely politicised process, and the first official responses we have been hearing from the foreign ministry and other official sources are taking the same line today.
The new British ambassador in Moscow, Laurie Bristow, arrived in Russia just ten days ago, and has a challenging start to his tenure. With Britain eager to keep contacts with Russia over Syria and other issues, he is likely to be working to smooth over the effects of the report with various Russian contacts.

 Russia dismisses report as 'politically motivated'  
Russia's foreign ministry has dismissed the inquiry as "politically motivated" and complained that it lacked transparency.
Maria Zakharova, spokeswoman for the Russian foreign ministry, gave this statement translated by Shaun Walker. 
Of course we need time to carefully study this document, after which we'll give a proper evaluation.
However, I can say that the Russian position on this issue is well known and unchanged. We regret that a purely criminal case has been politicised and has darkened the general atmosphere of our bilateral relations. It's obvious that the decision to end the coroner's investigation and start the public hearing had a clear political subtext. The process, despite its name, was not transparent either for Russia or for the general public, given the fact that some material was heard in closed session under the pretext of its secret nature.
Taking this into account, there was little grounds to expect that the final report of a process that was politically motivated and highly opaque, and prepared with a pre-determined "correct" result in mind, would suddenly turn out to be objective and balanced.

The report is is unlikely to have a significant impact on bilateral relations or on UK policy towards Russia, according to Alex Nice, analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. 
A few years ago, during the period of the US "reset" when much of the West was trying to rebuild relations with Russia, the findings of the inquiry could have put the UK government in an awkward position. Indeed, this may be why the inquiry was delayed for so many years. But relations are now so bad that it is difficult to see how this will have a major impact. Once the UK had imposed sanctions on Russia over Ukraine, the diplomatic risks of publicly accusing the Kremlin of murder were much reduced. Having said that, the argument that the UK should try to "re-engage" with Russia will inevitably return at some point. When that happens, the Litvenenko findings will strengthen the case of the sceptics.

The report says the operation to kill Litvinenko was probably approved by Nikolai Patrushev and President Putin. 
Shaun Walker has more on Patrushev. 
Nikolai Patrushev is one of the key figures in Putin's system; he is one of many close to the Russian president who came through the ranks of the KGB in Leningrad, like Putin himself. 
Patrushev succeeded Putin as head of the FSB when Putin left in 1999 to become prime minister, and held the post for nearly a decade. In 2008, he was replaced and became head of Russia's security council. He rarely makes public appearances but is known for hawkish statements on Nato and the west. He remains one of the few people with close, frequent access to Putin.
We published this interview with him last year. 
Marina Litvinenko said travel bans and asset freezes should be imposed on Patrushev as well as Putin.

 Lugovoi dismisses report as 'absurd'     Andrei Lugovoi  Photograph: Misha Japaridze/AP   
Andrei Lugovoi is reported to have dismissed the report as "absurd". 
Owen's report said: "I am sure that Mr Lugovoi and Mr Kovtun placed the polonium 210 in the teapot at the Pine Bar on 1 November 2006".
It added that it was "probable" Lugovoi poisoned Litvinenko under direction from the FSB, with Dmitry Kovtun "also acting under FSB direction". 
Lugovoi, who is now an MP with a nationalist political party, said: "The allegations against me are absurd," writes Shaun Walker. 
He added: "As we expected, there was no sensation. The results released to today just show London's anti-Russian position once again; the narrow-mindedness and lack of desire among the British to find the real reason for the death of Litvinenko."
"The 2014 events in Ukraine, which coincided with the resumption of the investigation into the Litvinenko case even though previously it had been declared secret, look like a pathetic attempt by London to use a 'skeleton in the cupboard' to support their political ambitions. I hope this 'polonium process' will once and for all dispel the myth about the impartiality of British justice."

The Liberal Democrat party has backed Marina Litvinenko's call for travel bans and the freezing of assets for those involved in the death. 
Leader Tim Farron said: "A UK citizen was killed on the streets of London with polonium. It was an attack on the heart of Britain, our values and our society.
"I call for EU travel bans, asset freezes and coordinated action to deal with those who committed this evil assassination. I have called for a new Magnitsky Law to make sure that these people are held to account for what they did.
"These assassins trampled over British sovereignty and we cannot let this go unanswered."

Goldfarb also called for UK sanctions to be imposed on Russia. He said Russia's "atomic enterprises" should be particularly targeted.

Tony Brenton, who was British ambassador to Russia at the time of the killing, said it was "unlikely" any proof about who authorised the murder had turned up. 
Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme he said: "Our reaction was that it was likely to have been authorised at quite a high level in the Russian system because they wouldn't do something so potentially damaging for a major power without high authorisation. 
But at my time there was no slam-dunk proof and I think it's quite unlikely any real evidence has turned up as to where the authorisation has come from." 
Brenton said that while the UK must react "strongly" to the murder, "tearing up" diplomatic relations with Russia was "not in Britain's interests". 
"We have quite important other fish to fry with the Russians. They are very important in carrying the Iran de-nuclearisation through, they are absolutely crucial in sorting out the mess in Syria."

Welcome to live coverage of the publication of the results of the public inquiry into the polonium poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko.
Here's the start of Luke Harding's curtain raiser to the publication of the hearing : 
Almost 10 years after he drank a cup of poisoned green tea in a Mayfair bar, the report into the murder of Alexander Litvinenko is due to be published, amid strong signs that the British government is reluctant to impose further sanctions on Russia.
The report will be released at 9.35am on Thursday, with Theresa May making a statement to parliament soon after. Litvinenko's widow, Marina, who received a copy of the report on Wednesday morning, will give her reaction at a press conference with her barrister, Ben Emmerson QC, and solicitor, Elena Tsirlina.
David Cameron received the report, which follows a public inquiry chaired by high court judge Sir Robert Owen, on Tuesday. It is widely believed that Owen will conclude that Litvinenko - who died in November 2006 after sipping radioactive polonium - was the victim of a Russian state assassination.
If, as expected, the Kremlin is blamed directly, Litvinenko's widow will demand a firm response from Downing Street. She is likely to call for fresh sanctions to be imposed on Russian politicians involved in the murder, as well as against state entities - a tough line that is also backed by the Liberal Democrats.
Last year, Emmerson described Litvinenko as the victim of a "state-sponsored act of nuclear terrorism" on the streets of London, adding that "the trail of polonium led directly to the door of Vladimir Putin's office". Emmerson dubbed the Russian president "a common criminal dressed up as a head of state."
At the time of his murder Litvinenko was a British citizen - and a part-time MI6 spy. Marina Litvinenko is understood to view the report as a major test for Cameron. The government's response, she believes, will show whether Downing Street is tough on all forms of terrorism, or only tough on terrorism carried out by non-state groups.
Luke has also put together a guide to six of the key players: Andrei Lugovoi, Marina Litvinenko, Sir Robert Owen, Dmitry Kovtun, Ben Emmerson and Vladimir Putin.

And here are six key questions for the inquiry to answer:

Who was responsible for Litvinenko's murder?
Did Putin order Litvinenko's death?
Might the two Russians charged with the murder - Dmitry Kovtun and Andrei Lugovoi - be innocent?
Should MI6 have done more to protect Litvinenko, a British agent?
Will Lugovoi and Kovtun ever go on trial?
What was the motive?

Tesco CEO heads up global food waste campaign launched at Davos; 
A coalition of 30 leaders from business, governments and NGOs wants to halve the amount of food wasted globally by 2030.

Terry Slavin.

A high-profile global campaign to halve the amount of food wasted on the journey between farm and plate has launched today at the World Economic Forum in Davos. 
Tesco CEO Dave Lewis is chair of a coalition of 30 leaders from business, governments, UN agencies, foundations and NGOs who want to prompt action to reduce the third of all food produced which is never consumed. Such volumes result from a combination of overproduction and wastage in the west and spoilage in developing countries. 
Craig Hanson, global director of food, forests and water at the World Resources Institute (WRI), says the aim of the campaign, Champions 12.3, is to build political momentum towards sustainable development goal 12.3 to halve per capita global food waste levels by 2030. Hanson likens this to the way global leaders rallied behind the millennium development goal of reducing the number of women who die in childbirth, helping contribute to a 45% decrease in maternal deaths since 1990.  
 Alongside the launch of Champions 12.3, Judith Rodin, president of the Rockefeller Foundation, launched YieldWise, a seven-year, $130m (£92m) initiative to tackle post-harvest losses of food due to spoilage in sub-Saharan Africa, starting with mango crops in Kenya, maize in Tanzania, and cassava and tomato crops in Nigeria. 
 Related:  Produced but never eaten: a visual guide to food waste
Mamadou Biteye, head of the Foundation's work in Africa, says hundreds of thousands of smallholder farmers in Africa lose 15-42% of their fruit and vegetable crops due to issues such as improper storage, lack of access to finance and inability to link to sustainable markets. The World Bank estimates (pdf) that just a 1% reduction in post-harvest losses in sub-Saharan Africa could lead to economic gains of $40m a year, most of which would go directly to farmers.
The announcement of the Champions 12.3 campaign is a gratifying moment for UK food waste campaigner Tristram Stuart, who has been lobbying for retailers and consumers to cut food waste volumes. His 2009 book, Waste: Uncovering the Global Food Scandal, argues that less than one-quarter of the food wasted in the US, UK and Europe would be enough to end malnourishment in the world, while just the bread and cereals UK households throw away could feed 30 million people.
At a recent conference, WRI president Andrew Steer also highlighted the significant contribution food waste makes to greenhouse gas emissions. "If food loss and waste was a country, it would be the third worst polluting country in the world, behind China and the US," he said.
According to Wrap, the Waste and Resources Action Programme, the UK wastes an estimated 15m tonnes of food a year, (pdf) nearly half of it (7m tonnes) by householders, and an estimated 3m tonnes is destroyed by farmers before it leaves the farm gate. 
Stuart, who was involved in setting up the Champions 12.3 coalition and recruiting its members, says consumers daily buy more food than they need, and most supermarkets refuse to give leftover food from their overstocked shelves to food charities. They also reject tonnes of food from suppliers for strictly cosmetic reasons - an issue recently highlighted by Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall in his War on Waste series on BBC One.
The plight of parsnip sellers in Norfolk who said they were considering selling up because 30-40% of their crop was being rejected by Morrisons is also playing out in countries like Kenya, where cancellations and amendments to orders by supermarkets can occur at the last minute, says Stuart. 
 "They get a cancellation order. They have to destroy their crops. Day labourers don't get paid and literally they can't put food on the plates of their children. And that is happening in our supply chains. We are paying for that. We are using Kenyan land and Kenyan water, in a country where there are millions of hungry people and where agriculture competes for habitat with elephants and lions ... To then waste 50% of what those farmers produce, we can all agree, is obscene."
 Related:  Climate change fails to top list of threats for business leaders at Davos
But Stuart says UK supermarkets have responded to pressure from his Feedback campaign group and from Wrap, and now lead the way on cutting food waste from their supply chains. Dave Lewis's position as chair of the Champions 12.3 coalition is a reflection of how far Tesco has come in tackling the issue. It is the only supermarket to report on its food waste to its investors (the others report to Wrap) and has moved forward with initiatives such as committing to use the entire crop of its banana suppliers. 
This has big financial implications for producers. Tesco's decision to stock Kenyan beans that haven't been chopped down to size to fit into supermarket plastic packets saved one supplier (EURO)70,000 (£50,000) a year in extra income, says Stuart.
"That's the kind of responsibility we want all retailers to take, to look into their supply chains, see how their policies are causing their suppliers to waste food and take responsibility for it."

Colorado lawmakers push sexual assault bill inspired by Bill Cosby allegations; 
Legislation would eliminate state's statute of limitations for felony sexual assault cases to make it easier for victims to pursue criminal charges against their rapists.

Sam Levin in San Francisco.

The widespread allegations of sexual assault against comedian Bill Cosby have inspired a push by Colorado lawmakers to make it easier for victims to pursue criminal charges against their rapists. 
Newly introduced bipartisan legislation would eliminate Colorado's statute of limitations for felony sexual assault cases, enabling prosecutors to go after suspects when accusations or evidence emerges years after the offense. 
Cosby has faced public allegations from more than 50 women - many of whom say the 78-year-old disgraced entertainer drugged and assaulted them.  
District attorneys, however, have been largely unable to seek criminal convictions, because the various statutes of limitations written into state laws bar them from filing charges after a certain number of years have passed. 
State representative Rhonda Fields, a Democrat, said that two Cosby accusers from Colorado - Beth Ferrier and Heidi Thomas - approached her last year with the idea of pursuing legislation that would abolish the state's existing 10-year time limit for sexual assault cases. Both women have accused Cosby of drugging and assaulting them in the 1980s.
"For them, it's validation that someone is listening to them, someone believes them, and someone is willing to act on their story," said Fields, who introduced the legislation with Republican state senator John Cooke last week. "It just gives them a sense of ... restored confidence in the criminal justice system."
The legislation would not be retroactive, meaning Cosby would still be shielded from criminal prosecution in the two Colorado cases if the bill becomes law. Although he has been the subject of many civil lawsuits, Cosby is only facing criminal charges in one case out of Pennsylvania, which prosecutors filed just before the 12-year statute of limitations there would have blocked the district attorney from moving forward.
Statutes of limitations vary by state. Fields said 16 other states don't have any time limits on when prosecutors can file charges in rape and sexual assault cases. Some of the states that do have limits on the books have exceptions for cases in which new DNA evidence emerges.
In California, prosecutors have to file rape charges within 10 years, which is why the Los Angeles County district attorney's office recently declined to press criminal charges against Cosby related to an allegation dating back to 1965.
In the wake of the Cosby scandal, state and federal officials are increasingly considering reforming or altogether removing various statutes of limitations with the recognition that it can take some victims a long time to come forward and share their stories. 
"We're seeing this as a trend across the country," said Rebecca O'Connor, vice president for public policy with the anti-sexual violence group Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN). "This validates for survivors that this is a serious crime ... and that somebody is willing to pursue every avenue to pursue justice and get answers."
O'Connor also noted that some rapists are serial offenders, and that if prosecutors have increased opportunities to target offenders, reform efforts like the Colorado proposal could get dangerous people off the street and help prevent future assaults. "The reality is, at the end of the day, you still have to have evidence to prove a case," she added.
Fields said that some survivors of rape can struggle with trauma for years and that it can take them a long time to come to terms with the assault, especially if the offender drugged them. A statute of limitations can send a painful message to them that their assault doesn't matter after time has passed, she said. 
Fields plans to bring Cosby's Colorado accusers to Denver to testify in support of the bill.
Cooke said that with the increasing use of DNA evidence to solve assault and rape cases, the legislation could open the doors to more prosecutions moving forward. "This is one way that we can put people who truly need to go to prison behind bars," he said. "It's not a partisan issue."
The bill will have its first hearing on 11 February.

Jimmy Savile report must 'stop abuse happening again' - BBC director general; 
Tony Hall admits child abuse scandal was 'dark chapter in history of BBC' after early draft of review is released to the mediaKey points of the leaked draft report.

Jasper Jackson.

The Jimmy Savile child abuse scandal was a "dark chapter in the history of the BBC", the corporation's director general has admitted after a highly critical report into the entertainer's treatment was leaked.  
Tony Hall said the corporation will use Dame Janet Smith's report into sexual abuse by Jimmy Savile to make sure nothing like it happens again, after key sections from an early draft appeared to show serious failings at the BBC. 
He added that the BBC could not act until the final version of the report was released and called for this to be done as swiftly as possible.
Hall said: "Dame Janet Smith's report will be invaluable in helping us understand what happened and to help ensure that we do everything possible to avoid it happening again."
 Related:  Jimmy Savile abuse report: key points of the leaked draft
In a statement, he said: "The review has said that the copy leaked to the media is an early draft which has changed considerably, so while I am impatient to learn those lessons the responsible thing must be to act on the final report which we have not received."
He added: "The review expects the report to be published within six weeks and we hope it will be published as swiftly as possible."
Responding to the leak on Thursday morning, Smith said the "document is out of date and significant changes have been made to its contents and conclusions. The document should not have been made public and cannot be relied upon in any circumstances."
 Chapters from the draft, including its conclusion, were leaked to investigative news website Exaro, which published extracts on Wednesday night. The draft, dating back more than a year, suggests the report will detail Savile's abuse of children at "virtually every one of the BBC premises at which he worked".
It outlines multiple rapes and indecent assaults by Savile, which she claims were all "in some way associated with the BBC". In one case a girl who complained was escorted off the premises.

Is Warren Gatland ready to unleash a more expansive Wales on Six Nations?; 
Wales had the meanest defence at the World Cup but tries were rare and they are trying to evolve their game to capitalise on the spaces out wide like New Zealand.

Paul Rees.

WALES KEEN TO TAKE THE SHACKLES OFF
When Warren Gatland started coaching Wales, the fixture against Ireland, his former employers, used to stir him into headline-making comments but time, success and two Lions tours have extinguished the fire that raged within and he was this week heard to be making flattering remarks about the Six Nations champions.
With Joe Schmidt and Vern Cotter both in the coaching school which believes in saying nothing that may provide opponents with motivation, England's Eddie Jones offers the one hope of a grenade lobber for the media. Gatland, once accessible and knowing what made a story, now rations his media duties to a minimum and is sparing with his thoughts.
The loss is the Fourth Estate's. Never mind Gatland's outpourings, the Wales players' dislike of the Irish, Dylan Hartley's combustibility (all the more the pity now the Northampton hooker is in line to become the England captain ) and skirmishes over the Millennium Stadium roof, the views on the game of one of the most successful coaches in its history are invariably interesting and illuminating. 
His reticence now, and as someone hoping to be appointed the Lions' head coach again it is not seemly to be winding up the other home unions, would matter little if the lines of communication between reporter and coach that existed in the amateur era still remained. Then, one was able to get them on the telephone day and night and, after an occasional chastisement for something written that had not gone down well at breakfast, or lunch in the case of some, insights were provided into tactics, selection and politics that never made it into print but which added colour to the picture one was trying to paint.
Today it is about huddles, where reporters crowd together to get a few minutes with a player or coach, and top tables, impersonal and formal, the regurgitation of pap. Eddie Jones has been different throughout his career, always willing to have a quiet chat, but after his first England squad announcement last week, he was whisked away from each of his engagements with the different sections of the media when his natural inclination might have been to linger.
The walls have gone up at a time when rugby union has become so analysis driven (Wales's chief analyst, Rhys Long, is off to join the Football Association after a highly productive period with the country and the Lions). Where decisions on players used to be based largely on what coaches saw themselves, performances are now broken down minutely but the data is rarely shared in detail with journalists whose own evidence remains largely empirical.
Gatland's time with Wales has not only seen them enjoy their best run of results since the 1970s but it has become a byword for continuity. There were no surprises in his 37-man squad for the Six Nations that he announced on Tuesday, a reward for the players who helped the side get out of the World Cup pool of death at England's expense and ran Australia and South Africa very close at Twickenham despite an injury curse that struck first a few weeks before the start of the tournament.
Wales have had the same coaches for virtually all the time Gatland has been in charge and there has been continuity in selection, although the end for some players has been brutal. They have also settled into a playing style based on getting over the gain-line, winning the aerial battle and being aggressive in defence. Wales throughout history have not had the biggest forwards but under Gatland they have fielded some imposing back divisions with three-quarters such as Jamie Roberts and George North resembling second-rows of yore.
Wales had the meanest defence in the World Cup with three tries conceded, two of them exceptional, but they were not so effective near their opponents' line; one try against England and South Africa, none against Australia even though they played for 13 minutes in the second half with at least a one-man advantage after two Wallabies were sent to the sin-bin.
The new France coach, Guy NovËs, believes international rugby is entering a new age, one where overt physicality and the seeking of contact is replaced by space and pace. Wales's attack coach, Rob Howley, has spent the last few months, after wearing out a tape of the Australia game as he looked at why his players did not score a try, analysing the World Cup which was widely regarded as being the best in the professional era in terms of attacking play.
"The weather helped," he said. "Until the latter stages matches were largely played in sunshine and players had a dry ball to move; had the tournament been played in the last two months, it would have been interesting to see how it would have turned out in markedly different conditions. If you look back at the World Cup, it is interesting to evaluate the passing movements of each side: one pass sees the receiver take contact while three or more constitute width.
"New Zealand had the lowest rate of one passes, 47%, and the highest, which surprised me, was Japan with 67%. When it came to three passes or more, New Zealand were again the highest with 18-19%. We are mid-table, above many other sides who made the quarter-finals; we want to pass and create space in the outside channels and there is no question that the game is evolving. In the coming weeks we will be looking for the ability of players to scan and achieve one more pass to get the ball wide.
"I can take you through every tackle, pass, lineout and scrum of that 13 minutes against Australia. We have to learn as players and coaches from what happened then and we will. We were held up over the line three times: accuracy and composure in the opposition 22 are critical to success in the Six Nations because you need to come away with points. We have to realise that when those moments come, you might not get another opportunity. We all need to evolve and the game's landscape is changing. When you look at stats, New Zealand kick the most and they pass the most. What is crucial is that they are the most accurate and it is in the international game where a player's skill-set is put under the most severe pressure. That is the challenge for us going forward."

PRIESTLAND'S MESSAGE TO BATH SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN SCRAMBLED
Wales named Rhys Priestland in their squad a few months after Bath said the outside-half was taking a sabbatical from international rugby.
Wales say that Priestland had never said to them he was putting his Test career on hold but would Bath have signed him if they had thought he would not have been around to provide cover for George Ford during the Six Nations?
The hasty recruitment of Dan Bowden after Bath realised Priestland would be with Wales during the Six Nations, apart from the fallow weekends, shows the message had been scrambled. As international rugby takes priority over the club game during Test windows, Bath could not prevent the fly-half from continuing his international career.
Whether Priestland is at the Recreation Ground next season is another matter. Bath look set for a clearout with Rob Webber, the captain Stuart Hooper and another Wales international, the second-row Dominic Day, out of contract at the end of the season.
This time a year ago Bath were on a high, about to qualify for the last eight of the European Champions Cup despite losing their first two group matches and well placed in the Premiership. Now they are playing for third place in their pool when they welcome Toulon on Saturday and they are ninth in the league with trips to Saracens, Northampton, Harlequins and Exeter to look forward to.
                     Bath have not become a bad team and their recruitment for next season includes the Wales and Lions No8 Taulupe Faletau but the confidence that bubbled last season has evaporated. That was clear last weekend when they succumbed to a Leinster side that included a sprinkling of regulars and a number of academy players.
The two sides, both former European Cup winners, have a different take on recruitment. The growing financial gap between the Premiership and the Guinness Pro12 means English clubs can buy while Leinster, say, have to develop. The province's academy system is working well but will they be able to hold on to all the players who come through?
The Wales squad contains 10 players who are based outside the country and, while Ireland have been able to keep the vast majority of their players over the years, JJ Hanrahan left Munster for Northampton last summer and another outside-half, Leinster's Ian Madigan, is off to Bordeaux-BËgles at the end of the season.
Among the Leinster academy is the 20-year old centre Harrison Brewer, whose father Mike played for New Zealand. At 6ft 4in and 16st 5lb, he has the build of a back-row, which is where he started out. "Looking at someone like Jamie Roberts, I felt I would suit that role," he said. He has already had four operations, on his hips, knee and thumb, putting his development back.
"There are so many good players in the academy," he said. "When you get your opportunity, you have to take it. I have not had it yet. I'm just keeping my head down and working away for my turn. The amount of time you get to execute things in the professional game is so limited that you need everything to be second nature, something you do instinctively without thinking about it."

HARLEQUINS WOULD OFFER LANCASTER GOOD ROUTE BACK
Harlequins were a year ago where Bath are now, but they have picked up this season and are handily placed in the Premiership, having recruited some senior internationals in the close season. They will lose their director of rugby, Conor O'Shea, at the end of the season. The former Ireland full-back is standing down after six years in charge and will not easily be replaced.
O'Shea took over at a time of turmoil after the Bloodgate scandal and guided Quins to their first Premiership title. More than that, his side played with a swagger and the nucleus of the squad was the product of the club's development system: very few players have left the club in their prime during his time in charge.
He will be sorely missed by Quins, not least because of his man-management. He has looked after Chris Robshaw in the last four years as well as his other internationals, regularly telling them to take a holiday during the season if he feels they are in danger of burn-out.
The former England head coach Stuart Lancaster was an early name dropped in as a potential replacement. He has spent a few weeks this month in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, at his own expense, looking at coaching methods in Super Rugby. He is a northerner and proud of it but a stint at the ground opposite Twickenham would be a good way back for someone whose record at international level was considerably better than the trashing he has received in some quarters would suggest.
O'Shea would appear to be going in the other direction. He has long been courted by Italy and, while he only last month said that, flattered though he was to be asked, he would not be following up the approach, he is now the favourite to succeed Jacques Brunel, who will leave the Azzurri after the Six Nations. It would be the best appointment made by the Italian Rugby Federation for some while.

CRACKDOWN ON GOUGING MUST HAPPEN ON THE FIELD AS WELL AS OFF
This week's list of citings from the last round of the European Champions Cup and Challenge Cup read as if it had been written 40 years before: gouging, biting, testicle-grabbing and referee shoving were among the offences alleged, along with punching.
For some of the miscreants there was nothing old-fashioned about the suspensions handed out. Chris Ashton's elation last week at being recalled to the England squad turned into despair as he  received a 10-week ban for making contact with the eye area of the Ulster centre Luke Marshall during the Champions Cup match at Saracens, ruling him out of the Six Nations.
A citing is made if it is considered that an offence merited a red card. The match referee, JÈrÙme GarcËs, looked at the incident on the big screen at the ground and he and the television match official ruled that Ashton had not made contact with his opponent's eye area. As Ashton's challenge resembled a neck roll, it was considered to be worthy of nothing more severe than a penalty.
So how is it that an incident scrutinised closely by the match referee and his assistant with access to all the camera angles turns from a penalty into a 10-week suspension? World Rugby has launched a crackdown on offences like gouging and wants deterrent sentences but Ulster, who would have had a man advantage for the final 64 minutes had Ashton been sent off as the tournament's judicial system said he should have been, are entitled to ask why that crackdown is being made in disciplinary hearings rather than on the field.
It is hard on Ashton, whose action was reckless rather than malicious, and 10 weeks seems disproportionate, but equally his hand was near Marshall's eye and it may be down to fortune that Marshall did not suffer a serious injury. Perhaps citing commissioners should sit alongside television match officials and provide a joined-up system.

STILL WANT MORE?
                     Robert Kitson ponders whether rugby union has become too complicated for its own good.
                     Alex Goode says Chris Ashton will bounce back from yet more England hurt.

Society needs to find shared values again; 
To function properly, a democracy needs to have a strong moral compass. At present we don't have one.

Cristina Odone.

Warren Vaughan, who runs parenting classes for Lighthouse Kidz, a non-profit community service company, likes to ask the mothers and fathers a question: "What do you value? And it can't be a person or a thing." It leaves them stumped. In 12 years, no one has said "tolerance", "patriotism" or even "love".
Captured Isis fighters had a hard time answering questions about sharia law 
Abstract discussion of values has virtually disappeared from our lives. We know what is "inappropriate" but not what is wrong - or, at least, what we can publicly denounce as wrong in front of our neighbours. We're no better at describing what is right. When politicians or churchmen talk about "values" - as David Cameron did, when he appealed first to "British" and then more recently to " Christian" values  - we cringe.
Middle-class embarrassment and liberalism have made us wary of words and concepts that have dominated philosophical discourse throughout the history of civilisation. "Values" reminds us of "Victorian values" and their Thatcherite reincarnation. As for "virtue", it reeks of the pulpit. Significantly, the term "value judgment" has acquired pejorative overtones. As a result, judgments involving values are simply not made.
To speak of single parents abusing the benefits system sounds presumptuous. Where other cultures are involved, liberal squeamishness has stopped us from addressing the scandals of forced marriage, gang grooming and Muslim girls being "disappeared" from secular British classrooms.
The sexual attacks on almost 100 young German women at Cologne railway station by men they described as north African have provoked heated debates about what the west stands for - and driven home the realisation that few can actually articulate our values.
Examine the young people who have rejected the relativism of liberal society in favour of fierce doctrine, and they do not seem committed to robust values of any sort. When Lydia Wilson interviewed half a dozen imprisoned Islamic State fighters last year in Kirkuk, Iraq, they had a hard time answering questions about sharia law and even the caliphate; their lives both before and after their conversions were hollowed out by the absence of the sorts of ties - with friends, neighbours, colleagues - that once sustained communal kindness.
Can those bonds be reconstructed? Politicians across the mainstream spectrum are now anxious to do so. Nicky Morgan, the education secretary, plans to introduce "character and values" in schools across the country; a move that shows a consensus is beginning to emerge. For if we are confused about what constitutes values, we are clearer that the absence of values is poisoning social relations
Where can we hope to find a remedy? We might start with the particular, identifying those institutions and initiatives that embody altruistic instincts and especially the mission to help the most vulnerable. Consider the following examples.
In Swindon, Shirley Ludford, a former BBC producer, has set up 105.5, a community radio station that concentrates on local stories - bus routes, small businesses, property development - while offering training and work to ex-offenders and townspeople affected by autism, trauma and sight impairment. The station acts as a community drop-in centre, with Shirley on hand to offer counselling.
                     PhysioNet, set up by Peter Thompson in a couple of disused farmhouses in Yorkshire, sends hospital equipment (beds, commodes, perching stools) to hospitals and children's care centres in, among others, Ukraine, Sierra Leone and Benin. Eighty volunteers work together to find the used equipment, pack it, deliver it - and overcome cross-border corruption.
In Brighton, Rosa Monckton is launching Team Domenica, a three-tier operation that includes a working cafe, run by people with learning disabilities; a Skilled for Life education course tailored for students with learning disabilities that offers qualifications; and, upstairs, an employment agency that will challenge local businesses to hire candidates with learning disabilities for 16 hours a week (any more, and the candidate would lose their benefits). The charity provides a volunteer to shadow the candidates on the job; the hope is that after three months, the company will hire the tried and tested candidate.
Finally, at Lighthouse Kidz, Warren Vaughan invites parents to unearth their own values through readings and discussions. He advises the couples, who come from mixed socio-economic backgrounds, to see their families as "schools for values". "When they reach a certain age, your children will stop listening to you," he says. "But they'll never stop learning from you."
These projects cannot be dismissed as ideological or proselytising. They embody an unspoken consensus about what is good for society: self-sacrifice, help for the vulnerable, strong ties between people. They point to a concept of values that people of different backgrounds can sign up to.
Defining and codifying these values will not be easy - but we can no longer fall back on platitudes from right and left about "tolerance" and "thrift". The demographic instability of the early 21st century could destroy our society in any number of ways. It is time to return yet again, with renewed urgency, to the question of shared values.

Comic Strip Presents ... Red Top review - So funny, it's uncanny: did the Comic Strip hack the Guardian?; 
Great turns from Maxine Peake as Rebekah Brooks, Nigel Planer as Rupert Murdoch and others provide lots of lols - especially the scene set in our offices. Also, The Town that Took on the Taxman.

Sam Wollaston.

'Never knowingly enjoy yourself", reads the banner over the Guardian editorial conference room. A bunch of smug, hippy liberal, Oxbridge journalists sing a rousing rendition ofthe Guardian anthem - Our Duty's to Our Readers, We Tell Them What to Think - while editor Alan Rusbridger plays along on the piano. "So, what enlightening and inspired piece of journalism do we have for tomorrow's health issue?" he asks when they're done.
A scene from Comic Strip Presents ... Red Top (UKTV Gold). Also a scene from my life. It's uncanny, there must be a spy here. Maybe Comic Strip creator "Whispering" Peter Richardson hacked us? Whatever, this is so spot on about the one small part I can vouch for that it must be spot on about everything else. 
OK, so some details might not be right. My former gaffer might not have spoken quite like that, or alwaysworn a yachting cap to work. Rebekah Brooks may not have rollerskated around the offices of News International to Native New Yorker by Odyssey. The phone-hacking scandal may not actually have happened in the 70s, if my memory serves me right. But, hey, this is satire, not documentary; caricature, not court drawing: a little leeway is allowed.
And the thrust of it, and the points it makes, are right and valid. Once upon a time, a girl called Rebekah comes to London, where a media mogul called Rupert (like the bear, though don't let that fool you, Rupert is basically in charge of the country) is so dazzled by her brilliance and her brilliant red hair he accidentally gives her a job editing one of his red tops. This newspaper - and others, though not this newspaper, obviously - does some bad things, listens to conversations it shouldn't listen to. But Rebekah doesn't know anything about that, even given her reputation for micromanagement ... You know how it goes, though you've never seen it like this before.
Why has Richardson moved it all to the 70s? I have no idea. So Tony Blair the rock star and former PM can have a moustache and groovy hippy waistcoat? So wannabe PM and arse-licker David Cameron can posh-twat-disco-dance to Donna Summer with Samantha? So Rebekah can be on rollerskates? Because surreality improves satire? Just for a laugh? All of the above I imagine. It certainly is a laugh, a glorious coming together of Leveson and Boogie Nights. Kill Bill, too, when Rupert's then-wife Wendi Deng is around. She's a power-crazed, sword-wielding, gong-banging Ninja assassin of general east Asian origin ... yeah, possibly a bit racist, with an l. (Yeah, typical bloody Guardian, sucking the joy out of it with my PC agenda ...)
The most important thing is that it's fabulous and hilarious, with so many great comedy performances. From Maxine Peake (lovely to see her losing all that miserable grit once in a while and being proper funny as Rebekah). From Russell Tovey, so convincingly Andy Coulson. From Comic Strip original Nigel Planer as Rupe. From Stephen Mangan as Blair again, Harry Enfield as Ross "listen, slag" Kemp, Eleanor Matsuura as Wendi, and more. And so many lols, such as the skating. And the time Rebekah comes into the office and hears Paul McCartney's voice ("Is that Radio 2?" "No Miss Brooks, it's phone taaaa ..." "I have no idea what phone taaa ... is" Puts fingers in ears). And the Guardian. Yes, we may be miserable bastards, but we can at least attempt to laugh at ourselves. The only shame is that The Comic Strip Presents is not on the BBC or Channel 4, and so was harder to find. If you missed it, you can catch up; I think you should.
Right, it's time for a celery break and the afternoon singsong: We're the Guardian, forever, let's swing to the left ...
Corporate tax avoidance is obviouslya scandal and a disgrace, but a tricky subject to do in a way that's not too boring. The Town that Took on the Taxman (BBC2) has a good go. Basically, a Welsh town goes offshore. Not as in breaks off, like an iceberg (Crickhowell is in the Brecon Beacons, not on the edge). But as in Crickhowell's small businesses get together, with The Revolution Will Be Televised's Heydon Prowse, to see if they can adopt the same schemes as the multinationals do and make things fairer, for them and for the country.
Yes, it's still about tax. But also real people, such as Steve (ex-special-forces coffee shop owner), and Russian Irena (optometrist and ice-cream parlour owner, eyes and ices). And they get to go to the Isle of Man and to Holland.
I still didn't (possibly didn't want to) fullyunderstand all the tax law. But I enjoyed the journey and the company.

The Weekly Beast: drama at Australian Women's Weekly, Cleo and Dolly; 
Cleo is dumped and Helen McCabe's tenure editing AWW ends as News Corp beds down new year appointments and Daily Mail Australia splits with Nine.

Amanda Meade.

There has been enough drama at the magazine empire of the Australian Women's Weekly, Dolly and Cleo in the past month to fuel another couple of miniseries in the vein of Paper Giants. The once-proud Australian company owned by the late Kerry Packer is being slowly downsized by its German owners, Bauer Media, who bought the company for $500m in 2012. 
One by one, titles have been closed or merged until this week a big-name title steeped in Australian cultural history, Cleo, was unceremoniously dumped. As well as losing several senior executives and outsourcing the printing and distribution of its 60 titles, Bauer parted company with the editor-in-chief of the Australian Women's Weekly, which is still Australia's bestselling magazine. After six years at the Weekly, former News Corp senior journalist Helen McCabe was suddenly out the door, reportedly with the remaining six months of her contract to be served on "gardening leave" and no job lined up. Weekly Beast understands Bauer's top brass is keen to get back to the magazine's roots in middle-class suburban life and away from the focus on news, politics and executive women that marked McCabe's tenure.  
 Related:  Cleo magazine to close and Dolly to become bimonthly, Bauer Media says
"In a very pretentious way Helen tried to turn that magazine into Vanity Fair," one magazine insider told Beast. 
Sources say the publisher Matt Dominello has made no secret of the fact he wants the Weekly to get back to being a mass-market magazine focused on middle-aged mums, knitting, cooking and celebrities. McCabe has so far declined to comment on her future, but she has remained close to News Corp and may yet turn up at Holt Street.
The Bauer executive is now looking for someone significantly cheaper to run the Weekly (McCabe's salary was $400,000).Whoever the new editor-in-chief is, her digital strategy will have to be a priority - the website has improved under McCabe's tenure but still has a long way to go. Some of the names being mentioned as outside hires are Kate de Brito, a former News Corp journalist who is now editing Mamamia, the former editor of Mamamia, Jamila Rizvi, and Daily Telegraph columnist and editor Sarrah Le Marquand.

Why Bali was the 'shareable' word of 2015
You might be surprised to hear that the most shareable word in 2015 was "Bali". Why? The authors of All Your Friends Like This - How Social Networks Took Over News (HarperCollins, 2015) found that people share news "as an expression of values and judgement". Co-author Andrew Hunter, the editor-in-chief at Microsoft, said last year everyone had an opinion about the executions in Bali of Australian drug runners Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran - and to prove their passion they shared countless stories about it. The other 14 most shareable words, according Hunter and Hal Crawford, the editor-in-chief of Ninemsn, were: girl, Bishop, Tony, Paris, health, Turnbull, children, cancer, climate, dog, hospital, media, secret and shark, reflecting popular stories such as the Bronwyn Bishop choppergate scandal, the Paris attacks, climate change, Mick Fanning's shark attack and the demise of Tony Abbott's prime ministership.

News Corp's new year shake-up
News Corp Australia chiefs have made several appointments in the new year, promoting Herald Sun news editor Liam Houlihan to editor of the Geelong Advertiser and the editor of the Sunday Herald Sun, Jill Baker, to the new position of executive editor, Sundays. Baker will be succeeded as editor of the Sunday paper by Geelong Advertiser editor Nick Papps. The bigger name editors all moved into position at the Australian, the Daily Telegraph and the Courier Mail over Christmas. However, we are yet to hear of any major changes that Paul Whittaker, Chris Dore or Lachlan Heywood have made at their respective titles. Steady as she goes. We are also still waiting for Chris Mitchell's promised media column to appear in the the Australian's media section, as promised by Darren Davidson last year. "Mr Mitchell will return to his journalistic roots, writing a regular column for the Australian in the Monday media section," Davidson reported. 

Red/black faces at Fox Sports
Some guests at the Fox Sports Christmas party were a little taken aback to see one personality turn up in blackface at the Ibiza-themed celebration. Photographs seen by Beast reveal the outfit included black make-up covering his face, head and hands, dark sunglasses, headphones around his neck and a black sweatshirt and jeans. Apparently he was depicting a partying West Indian cricketer. Fox Sports management declined to comment on whether there had been any repercussions.

Daily Mail and Nine's conscious uncoupling
In another big media shakeup, Daily Mail Australia has broken off its partnership with Nine, two years after the popular global website launched here. To launch its racy news offering in Australia, the Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT) entered into a joint-venture with the Nine Entertainment Company, which provided traffic and sales support while the Mail operated independently in editorial. But increasingly, the two online sites became rivals, and ninemsn (No 5) overtook the Daily Mail (No 6) in the Nielsen online ratings last month. 
At a meeting last Monday in Sydney between the global Mail Online publisher and chief executive, Martin Clarke, and the chief executive of Nine, Hugh Marks, it was decided to part ways. Peter Holder, the managing director of Daily Mail Australia, told Weekly Beast the joint venture was "never going to be forever" and the Mail was now focused on increasing its readership and ad sales. "We couldn't have done it without the help of Nine," Holder said. "We've become more rivals than partners and both parties agreed it was time. We're working closely to unwind it and there is certainly no bad blood." If anything Mail readers may benefit from the break in the partnership as Beast understands Nine's publicity department was never pleased when the Mail covered rival network shows - such as The Bachelor Australia - or reported on Nine's personalities in an unflattering way.

Evo Morales celebrates 10 years as Bolivia's 'indigenous socialist' president; 
Thousands of Ayamara and Quechua people gathered to honor country's first indigenous leader, whose term could be extended to 2025 after referendum.

Jonathan Watts in La Paz, Bolivia.

In a riot of colour, noise and statistics, Bolivian president Evo Morales marked 10 years of his "indigenous socialist" rule on Friday, one month before a referendum that could extend his period in office until 2025. 
The celebrations for the country's first indigenous leader and longest-serving president saw thousands of formerly marginalized Aymara and Quechua people gather outside the national congress building in Plaza Murillo in La Paz, alongside representatives from indigenous groups from neighbouring Chile, Argentina, Paraguay and Peru.
Many held aloft photographs of Morales, a former coca grower who is credited with improving indigenous rights through social programmes and the introduction of a pluri-national constitution that recognised the multi-ethnic diversity of the country. 
The presence of the "cholas" and "cholitas" with their distinctive bowler hats, colourful shawls and llama-emblazoned banners was itself a sign of change as members of indigenous groups were once refused access to the plaza and other central areas because they were seen as belonging to a servant class.
The economic situation in Bolivia has also improved from a low base thanks to a rapid expansion of gas exploitation, mining and soy production. Between 2006 and 2014, Bolivia notched up an average growth of 5.1%, one of the highest in the Americas.
Key industries have been nationalised and their revenues channeled into welfare programs and infrastructure projects, such as the cable car systems that have transformed the lives of many living on the periphery of this spectacular Andean city, which sits at 3,650m altitude.
Despite opening up the country to massive mineral exploration, particularly by Chinese companies, Morales claims he is focussed on securing a balance between development and environmental protection.
For Thursday's anniversary, he paid homage to Pachamama (Mother Earth) at Kalasasaya, a pre-Incan temple at Tiahuanaco where the ancients believed the Door of the Sun could be found.
"With this small but very important act, I would like to take the opportunity to express our gratitude for these 10 years of service to the Bolivian people," Morales said.
Friday's ceremonies were more political in nature. Speaking to congress, the president recalled how he had once been expelled from the parliament building and was accused of being a drug trafficker and terrorist. 
"Peace can only be achieved through social justice," he said before turning to a long list of achievements over the past 10 years, including a fall in inflation from 11.5% to 6.3%, a tripling of per-capita income, and steady falls in poverty and inequality.
After Morales' nearly five-hour speech, a presidential parade passed along red carpets on the street, which were lined with an honour guard. The streets thronged with revellers, with music by military bands and indigenous groups.
Morales first came to power in 2006, following victories by other leftist leaders in the region, including Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, Raphael Correa in Ecuador and Ignacio Lula de Silva in Brazil.
While many other leftwing movements have faltered due to slowing economies, falling commodity prices and voter anger at bribery scandals, Morales has remained popular.
Although he has also been challenged over corruption and environmental destruction, he won a third term with a landslide victory in 2014, and is now seeking a revision of the constitution that would allow him to run again, potentially up to 2025. This has prompted concerns that he is putting his desire to cling to power above democratic term limits.
A referendum on the subject will take place on 21 February. Morales is expected to win, according to the latest polls, although the gap has narrowed. 
On the streets, views were mixed. Pamela Guitierrez, a 28-year-old graphic design student from El Alto, said Morales had earned more time. "He has done a lot for us. Other presidents promised a great deal and delivered only instability. Evo is the opposite. He has really put Bolivia on the map."
But others were unhappy about the proposed change. Eduardo Lopez, a 29-year-old student, said he plans to vote no next month because he believes 19 years is too long even for a good president like Morales. "They are trying to change the constitution just to benefit two people, the president and vice-president. It's like changing the rule of the game halfway through."

Bahrain campaigners warn Fifa sponsors of concerns over Sheikh Salman; 
∑ Salman is favourite to replace Sepp Blatter as Fifa president in February ∑ Campaigners raise questions over his conduct after pro-democracy uprising.

Owen Gibson.

Bahraini pro-democracy campaigners have written to Fifa's top sponsors to raise concerns over Sheikh Salman al-Khalifa's attempt to become the president of world football's governing body.
 Related:  Fifa presidency: German FA backs Gianni Infantino to replace Sepp Blatter
The Asian Football Confederation president has emerged as the favourite to take over from Sepp Blatter at February's election but the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy insists he still has questions to answer over his alleged role in punishing clubs after the 2011 pro-democracy uprising in the country. 
Sheikh Salman has admitted he was asked to head a fact-finding committee to examine the role of footballers and athletes in the uprising, as reported by the state news service, but has said the committee was never formally constituted.
In the letter to Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Visa, Adidas, Budweiser, Gazprom and Kia, the BIRD also claims the Bahrain Football Association, of which Sheikh Salman was president at the time, suspended and punished six clubs on politically motivated grounds.
"We hope Fifa's sponsors consider our letter very seriously and respond immediately and appropriately," said Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei of BIRD. "Sheikh Salman led the politicised punishment of clubs and denies the torture Bahraini players underwent. Coca-Cola have called for an accountable Fifa. What happened in Bahrain was a black mark on its history and Sheikh Salman must be held accountable for the part he played."
In a letter, seen by the Guardian, the six clubs wrote to the BFA asking for their matches to be suspended on safety grounds given the security situation in the country. They were later fined and two were relegated.
A report on the Bahrain state news agency website in April 2011 said the BFA administrative council "stressed the importance of working in accordance to the commission of inquiry's decisions concerning all those who have offended our leadership and our precious Kingdom, and to work on excluding all those whose participation [in the events] have been proven including administrators, referees and members of the working committees of BFA."
Sheikh Salman, who became president of the Asian Football Confederation in 2013 with the support of Blatter, decided to stand for the Fifa presidency after the banned Uefa president Michel Platini was forced to withdraw from the race.
The other contenders for the Fifa presidency are the former Fifa vice-president Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan, the former Fifa executive JÈrÙme Champagne, the South African former anti-apartheid campaigner and businessman Tokyo Sexwale and Uefa's general secretary, Gianni Infantino.
After years of resisting calls to put pressure on Fifa over corruption allegations, the wave of arrests in May last year and a US indictment that accompanied allegations of a "World Cup of fraud" prompted a strong reaction from Fifa's corporate backers.
Fifa has admitted the corruption crisis has damaged its finances, with new sponsors reluctant to be linked with Fifa and fees for lawyers and consultants spiralling.
 Related:  Fifa academic demands outcry from FAs over Sheikh Salman presidential bid
Sponsors including Coca-Cola and McDonald's in June called for an external reform process and a larger cohort later wrote to Fifa demanding that Blatter stand down immediately rather than hanging on until February.
Blatter was later suspended over a £1.3m "disloyal payment" to Platini and banned from football for eight years.
Human Rights Watch's Gulf researcher Nicholas McGeehan said: "At a time when Fifa is going through the biggest crisis in its history it would seem like an act of institutional suicide for it to appoint as its leader a man who was apparently responsible for sanctioning clubs who failed to show loyalty to a murderous regime."
Sheikh Salman has consistently rejected claims that he was involved in identifying players involved in the protests who were later imprisoned and, in some cases, tortured.
Associated Press reported in 2011 that more than 150 athletes, coaches and referees were jailed after being identified from photos of protests.
"The allegations are entirely false and categorically denied by Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa," said a statement issued through the London law firm Schillings to the Guardian last year. "While it was proposed that Sheikh Salman lead a fact-finding committee in relation to the events of 2011, that committee was never formally established and never conducted any business whatsoever.
"For the record, and in light of the recycling of historic allegations in the media, Sheikh Salman had absolutely no involvement in the identification, investigation, prosecution or mistreatment of any individuals as has been alleged."
Sheikh Salman said this week: "When people talk about skeletons in the closet, my closet is clear. Some people have an agenda but it's a waste of time trying to answer them and I think it has already been done by the proper bodies within Fifa and the AFC. There has been an integrity check and I don't have anything to defend myself about."

"Peace can only be achieved through social justice," he said before turning to a long list of achievements over the past 10 years, including a fall in inflation from 11.5% to 6.3%, a tripling of per-capita income, and steady falls in poverty and inequality.
A presidential parade passed along red carpets on the street, which were lined with an honour guard. The streets thronged with revellers, many of them playing traditional instruments.
Morales first came to power in 2006, following victories by other leftist leaders in the region, including Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, Raphael Correa in Ecuador and Ignacio Lula de Silva in Brazil. 
While many other leftwing movements have faltered due to slowing economies, falling commodity prices and voter anger at bribery scandals, Morales has remained popular.
Although he has also been challenged over corruption and environmental destruction, he won a third term with a landslide victory in 2014, and is now seeking a revision of the constitution that would allow him to run again, potentially up to 2025. This has prompted concerns that he is putting his desire to cling to power above democratic term limits.
A referendum on the subject will take place on 21 February. Morales is expected to win, according to the latest polls, although the gap has narrowed.

Fifa sponsors warned of concerns over Sheikh Salman by Bahrain campaigners; 
∑ Salman is favourite to replace Sepp Blatter as Fifa president in February ∑ Campaigners raise questions over his conduct after pro-democracy uprising.

Owen Gibson.

Bahraini pro-democracy campaigners have written to Fifa's top sponsors to raise concerns over the candidacy of Sheikh Salman al-Khalifa's attempt to become president of world football's embattled governing body.

The Asian Football Confederation president has emerged as the favourite to take over from Sepp Blatter at February's election but the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy insists he still has questions to answer over his alleged role in punishing clubs in the wake of the 2011 pro-democracy uprising in the country. 
Sheikh Salman has admitted that he was asked to head a fact-finding committee to examine the role of footballers and athletes in the uprising, as reported by the state news service, but has said the committee was never formally constituted.
In the letter to Fifa's top World Cup sponsors - Coca-Cola, McDonalds, Visa, Adidas, Budweiser, Gazprom and Kia - BIRD also claims that the Bahrain Football Association, of which Sheikh Salman was president at the time, suspended and punished six clubs on politically motivated grounds.
In a letter, seen by the Guardian, the six clubs wrote to the BFA asking for their matches to be suspended on safety grounds given the security situation in the country. But they were later fined and two were relegated.
A report on the Bahrain state news agency website in April 2011 said the BFA administrative council "stressed the importance of working in accordance to the commission of inquiry's decisions concerning all those who have offended our leadership and our precious Kingdom, and to work on excluding all those whose participation [in the events] have been proven including administrators, referees, and members of the working committees of BFA".
Sheikh Salman, who became president of the Asian Football Confederation in 2013 with the support of Blatter, decided to stand for the Fifa presidency after the banned Uefa president Michel Platini was forced to withdraw from the race.
The other contenders for the presidency are the former Fifa vice president Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan, the former Fifa executive JÈrÙme Champagne, the South African former anti-apartheid campaigner and businessman Tokyo Sexwale and Uefa's general secretary Gianni Infantino.
After years of resisting calls to put pressure on Fifa over corruption allegations, the wave of arrests in May last year and a US indictment that accompanied allegations of a "World Cup of fraud" prompted a strong reaction from Fifa's corporate backers.
Fifa has also admitted that the corruption crisis has damaged its finances, with new sponsors reluctant to come to the table and fees for lawyers and consultants spiralling.

Sponsors including Coca-Cola and McDonald's in June called for an external reform process and a larger cohort later wrote to Fifa demanding that Blatter stand down immediately rather than hanging on until February. In the event, Blatter was later suspended over a £1.3m "disloyal payment" to Platini and banned from football for eight years.
"We hope FIFA's sponsors consider our letter very seriously and respond immediately and appropriately," Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, director of advocacy at BIRD. "Sheikh Salman led the politicised punishment of clubs and denies the torture Bahraini players underwent. Coca-Cola have called for an accountable Fifa. What happened in Bahrain was a black mark on its history, and Sheikh Salman must be held accountable for the part he played."
Human Rights Watch's Gulf researcher, Nicholas McGeehan, said: "At a time when Fifa is going through the biggest crisis in its history it would seem like an act of institutional suicide for it to appoint as its leader a man who was apparently responsible for sanctioning clubs who failed to show loyalty to a murderous regime."
Sheikh Salman has consistently rejected claims that he was involved in identifying players involved in the protests who were later imprisoned and, in some cases, tortured.
Associated Press reported in 2011 that more than 150 athletes, coaches and referees were jailed after being identified from photos of protests.
"The allegations are entirely false and categorically denied by Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa," said a statement issued through the London law firm Schillings to the Guardian last year. "While it was proposed that Sheikh Salman lead a fact-finding committee in relation to the events of 2011, that committee was never formally established and never conducted any business whatsoever.
"For the record, and in light of the recycling of historic allegations in the media, Sheikh Salman had absolutely no involvement in the identification, investigation, prosecution or mistreatment of any individuals as has been alleged."

Turnbull's popularity soars over summer as Shorten's suffers, poll shows; 
Seven News/ReachTel poll shows two-party preferred vote stable, but Turnbull's preferred PM rating rises by nearly 10 points to 80.8%.

Daniel Hurst Political correspondent.

Malcolm Turnbull's personal popularity has improved over the summer parliamentary recess, according to a new poll, suggesting the prime minister's electoral "honeymoon" is not over yet. 
A Seven News/ReachTel poll shows the Coalition retains a 55% to 45% lead over Labor on a two-party preferred basis, which is stable compared with the previous corresponding poll conducted in November.
                     Ministerial scandals, which led to Jamie Briggs resigning and Mal Brough standing aside just after Christmas, and the Liberal party's jostling over forthcoming preselections in New South Wales do not appear to have dented the Coalition's support.
 Related:  Malcolm Turnbull's popularity dips in poll, as Bill Shorten slumps to fresh low
The proportion of people nominating Turnbull as preferred prime minister rose nearly 10 points to 80.8%, while those favouring Bill Shorten declined by the same number of points to 19.2%.
ReachTel differs from other major opinion polls in that it requires people to select one of the two options for preferred prime minister rather than allowing "don't know" or "undecided" responses. This partly explains why Turnbull's score is greater than in other major polls.
When asked to rate Turnbull's performance as prime minister, 53.6% said it was either good or very good, an improvement of 5.4 points since the last poll in November, while 14.8% said his performance was poor or very poor (down 2.3 points) and the remainder said satisfactory.
Respondents were unimpressed with Shorten's performance as opposition leader, with just 13.8% saying it was good or very good (down 6.8 points) and 57.4% believing it was poor or very poor (up 9.9 points).
ReachTel conducted the poll of 3,116 residents across Australia on Thursday night and said the margin of error was 1.8%.
Shorten has embarked on a three-week national tour of marginal seats to campaign against increasing the goods and services tax, cutting penalty rates and reducing pathology incentive funding.

"We will oppose a 15% GST on everything with every breath in our body," he said in Alice Springs on Friday.
The government has accused Shorten of mounting a "scare campaign" and it is yet to settle details of the tax package it will take to voters at this year's election.
The treasurer, Scott Morrison, rubbished speculation about an early election. "The election is at the other end of this year," he said on Friday.
The prime minister has returned to Australia after visiting troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and travelling to the US for a meeting with Barack Obama.
In the final ReachTel before Turnbull challenged for the Liberal leadership in September, Shorten led Tony Abbott as preferred prime minister, 57.9% to 42.1%.

As we give up on saving, we give up on our future; 
For millions of us, the idea of planning for the long term no longer makes sense. We're living for the moment, and the implications are terrifying.

Gaby Hinsliff.

Once upon a time there was a Frenchwoman who made it her life's mission to save two of everything. Not just a spare for every possible eventuality - filling every cupboard to bursting, littering her cellar - but a twin for every object she owned, right down to table lamps.
This hoarding made no sense at all, until it emerged that her grandfather once saved his family's lives during the war by producing a spare reel of thread for a German soldier who needed to repair his uniform. Without that favour, they could have died. And so even as an adult, she could only feel safe so long as she had one of everything in reserve. 
Although Madame Rosen the hoarder is nominally fictional - she's a character in Muriel Barbery's novel The Elegance of the Hedgehog - one senses her creation must have been inspired by a true story. The children of wartime refugees often have family anecdotes of slightly demented scrimping and saving, drawers full of oddments that will patently never be used. We all save to feel secure, and not merely financially; even if it's only spare coppers in a jar, saving makes us feel more in control of our destinies, more confident of facing down unknown threats.
But saving isn't just about holding off the darkness. To save is to plan, to imagine a future and work towards it: just ask any teacher. Saving teaches self-discipline, impulse control, the ability to forgo instant gratification in exchange for future reward - all the things famously measured by the Stanford marshmallow test, in which four-year-olds were offered the choice of one marshmallow now or two if they could bear to wait 15 minutes.
What makes the experiment so famous is that those few kids who resisted temptation didn't just grow up to get higher exam scores, but were also still leading more successful lives four decades later. But what if it had all been a con, and there hadn't been a second marshmallow? What happens when you save and save for a whole lot less reward than expected?
Anyone with a mortgage will probably have breathed a faint sigh of relief this week when Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, made clear that interest rates weren't about to rise after all (with the tacit implication that it's no longer clear when they will).
But it's a very different picture for savers, gloomily watching their nest eggs shrink in real terms. The paltry interest earned in the average high street bank account is so quickly outstripped by inflation that you might almost as well keep cash in a biscuit tin under the bed. And that's no longer the only threat to what, in Britain, was never a terribly strong savings culture to start with. The next big battle will be over pensions.
I know, I know: nobody wants to read about pensions. Pensions are boring snoring, except when you briefly consider how long you might be living on one, when they become briefly terrifying. That's why outrage over pink lady razors costing more than identical men's ones is headline news, and the fury of older women only now realising they'll be hit by a sudden rise in pensionable age is not.
But it's perhaps also why politicians are increasingly tempted by complex, interminably tedious pension reforms as a means of slashing state spending. After all, it could be years before anyone realises. So skip the rest of the piece by all means - just don't say you weren't warned.
The unlucky generation for whom life basically consists of realising you can't have the stuff your parents took for granted - free higher education, say, or home ownership - now find a decent pension is the next thing in the line of fire. They now face an erosion of incentives to save, shaky confidence in scandal-ridden financial institutions, and perhaps the kind of stock market volatility currently busy wiping billions off pension funds. (Those bankers you saw losing their shirts this week? Strictly speaking that was your shirt, if you've got money in a pension.)
The Treasury swears it's genuinely undecided over proposals to slash the tax relief that higher-rate earners enjoy on pension contributions, or to reduce the amount that can be sheltered in pensions. But the smoke signals emerging are enough to worry both Tory MPs and the Daily Mail, which this week began campaigning vigorously to save middle-class pensions.
Many won't weep for the squeezed upper middle, of course. Chipping away at tax reliefs that benefit the relatively wealthy is one of the most progressive things George Osborne has done - even if the fear is that the genuinely rich will simply find somewhere else to shelter their loot, leaving people who can't afford fancy accountants to bear the brunt.
But the knottier problem is with the millions who aren't saving for retirement because they can't afford to - and with a fast-growing army of self-employed people for whom the whole thing increasingly doesn't seem to add up (which might be why they are three times less likely than wage slaves to have a pension).
What if work dried up tomorrow, and you needed the cash in a hurry? Is it really safe to tie up every spare penny in something that, as the small print always says, can go down as well as up - especially if there's no employer helpfully topping the whole thing up? In a world of increasingly insecure casualised labour and dwindling returns, suddenly that promised second marshmallow starts to look a pretty sad, half-nibbled prospect - barely worth waiting for.
So, like those millennials who are increasingly giving up on saving for a deposit because the whole idea of buying a house seems so impossibly out of reach, the temptation is just to live for the moment. Spend money on stuff that makes life worth living now, try not to think about what comes next, embark on what basically amounts to a gigantic game of chicken with those future governments who will be in charge when we all retire into penury.
And that's the real problem about chipping away, little by little, at saving. It's not just the act of saving money itself you're destroying, although the economic implications of that are bleak enough. It's the idea that individuals have some control over their own future lives, that self-sacrifice will be rewarded - and that the people in charge weren't lying about the second marshmallow.

Good evening from New York City, where we're wrapping up today's installment of the Guardian's 2016 campaign liveblog. For the next 236 days, we'll keep bringing you minute-by-minute coverage of the campaign trail, from the cornfields of Iowa to the convention halls of Cleveland - and every Trump rally in between.
 One year before the inauguration of the 46th president of the United States, a flurry of new polls indicated that the race to the Oval Office is becoming more volatile by the day. With only 11 days to go before the Iowa caucuses - and on the heels of a CNN/WMUR poll released that shows Vermont senator Bernie Sanders with a commanding 27-point lead in New Hampshire - a new CNN/ORC poll gave Sanders an eight-point lead over Hillary Clinton in Iowa - 51% to 43%.
Clinton had led Sanders by 18 points in the same poll last December, 54% to 36%, and the reversal of fortunes in the Hawkeye State could be hugely damaging if CNN's numbers come to pass. Although Clinton's numbers are firmer in South Carolina, a one-two loss in the first primary states could mean the beginnings of a domino effect. 
So much for her Demi Lovato-certified confidence.

Meanwhile, the same survey gave billionaire Republican frontrunner Donald Trump a double-digit lead among likely Republican caucus-goers, leading Texas senator Ted Cruz 37% to 26%. Florida senator Marco Rubio is in a distant third place at 14%. No other member of the crowded field cracks the double digits - which makes Jeb(!) Bush a real sad sack.

Permanent second-place Republican candidate Ted Cruz alienated the key "nerd" demographic after refusing to take a "Jedi pledge" to "blow up the Death Star" of Citizens United, the 2010 supreme court ruling that allowed corporations and unions to spend unlimited money in support of political campaigns. Cruz called it a matter of free speech, although it would have been way more on-brand for him to say that he found the questioner's lack of faith in the judicial branch disturbing.
The Guardian's Ben Jacobs, reporting from the birthplace of deep-fried Oreos, reminded us that despite his precipitous fall in polls, retired pediatric neurosurgeon Ben Carson still has Secret Service protection. His Secret Service codename: "Eli."
( Fun fact: Secret Service codenames, a legacy from pre-NSA days when sensitive electronic communications weren't encrypted, are bestowed by the White House Communications Agency. The first family's codenames are traditionally alliterative, and Al Gore's daughter Karenna was codenamed "Smurfette." If Liveblog Scott were to choose a Secret Service codename, it would either be "Bookbag" or "Stormtrooper.")
In more bad news for Clinton, the former secretary of state - Secret Service codename: "Evergreen" - infuriated students at the University of Iowa after speaking for only five minutes after a three-song Demi Lovato concert was held in her honor.

Demi Lovato won rave reviews at a Clinton campaign rally in Iowa City, according to the Guardian's Adam Gabbatt. If only the same could be said for Hillary herself...
Hillary Clinton left her audience cold in Iowa City on Thursday night, after she spoke for less than five minutes to a crowd of more than a thousand people, some of whom had lined up for over an hour to see her.
After a day marred by a new poll showing Bernie Sanders leading her by eight points in Iowa, Clinton might have been expected to go for broke at a rally featuring a performance by pop star Demi Lovato.
But Clinton did not reference the Vermont senator in her speech, the length of which appeared to upset many in the crowd.
"It was like a political commercial," said Allisson Steigerwald, a 24-year-old graduate student at the University of Iowa. "I thought she was saying goodbye to Demi and then she'd start her speech. But it never happened."
"It was very short," said Jennifer Marks, 22. "There were a lot of statements. Like: 'We are we going to make things happen.'," Marks said. "No actual how."
Marks said she felt less inclined to vote for Clinton as a result. "But it wasn't very likely to begin with," she added. She plans to vote for Sanders.
"I just feel bad for the people who got here at 5," she said.
Clinton took the stage at around 8.15pm, after Lovato had performed three songs from her recent album Confident. Clinton praised Lovato, who has bipolar disorder and is the face of the Be Vocal mental health campaign, for "having the voice to reach out to so many people who need a little bit of help themselves.
"You have set an extraordinary example to so many in the way you have talked about issues that we all find sometimes hard to talk about," Clinton said.
The rest of her speech was so short that it is possible to summarize almost all of it in the next six paragraphs.
Clinton thanked the audience for attending. "I'd be so thrilled and honoured if you can caucus for me," she said. She then promised to "work as hard as I know how to take it to the Republicans" and win the election. 
Clinton said was proud of the progress made under President Obama and promised to deal "with the big issues" if elected.
"Like: how do we get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top," she said. 
"How we keep our country safe and lead the world with peace prosperity and security. And how do we deal with a lot of those prelims that people across Iowa talk to me about. How are we going to afford college, how do we get the cost of student debt down?"
She spoke about making prescription drugs more affordable and defending "human rights and women's rights". And about how she would "take on those big special interests" if elected.
"Join us in helping to change our country, keep it on a progressive path, make sure we don't go backward we go forward with confidence," Clinton said.
And that was it.
 Definitely not cool for the summer. Or the winter. Or any season, really.

 The Guardian's Adam Gabbatt  reports live from Iowa City on the most important story of the night and possibly of the campaign: Singer Demi Lovato's appearance in Iowa with Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton:

We have Demi Lovato! She walked into the hall to applause before joining her band - accoustic guitar, keyboard, drums - on stage.
"Hello. My name is Demi. I'm so excited to be here!" Lovato said, with typical grace and modesty.
With that she launched into a rousing rendition of recent hit Confident, from the 2015 album of the same name. ( Ed. : Yaaass.)
The crowd - and I - went wild.
"I don't think there is a woman more confident than Hillary Clinton," Lovato said afterwards.
Lovato, who was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on August 20 1992, then performed Stone Cold. The song is the fifth track on her album Confident, which peaked at number 11 on the Billboard top 100 chart. The album's eponymous song went platinum.
"I've got one more song for you guys, and the title of this song is why everyone should vote!" Lovato then told her adoring audience.
The song was Yes, the tenth track from Confident. Confident received a 4.5 star rating (out of five stars) upon its release last October.
A mesmerizing performance.

 More good polling news for Donald Trump: A Zogby Analytics poll of likely Republican primary voters shows the billionaire frontrunner receiving the support of a whopping 45% of the national primary electorate, leading Texas senator Ted Cruz by 32 points.
According to Zogby, Trump polls wins the lion's share of male Republican voters with 49% support, women with 41%, as well as Republicans overall with 47%. He also takes 49% of independents - who can only vote in certain primaries, including the Iowa caucuses - 46% of self-described conservatives and 45% of self-described moderates.
In speculative head-to head matchups, Trump beats Cruz 59% to 29%, Florida senator Marco Rubio 64% to 27%, former Florida governor Jeb(!) Bush 68% to 22%, Ohio governor John Kasich 73% to 15% and New Jersey governor Chris Christie 69% to 19%.
It's what former president George W. Bush might call " a thumpin'."
Behind Cruz's distant second-place support at 13%, Rubio commands 8% of the national primary electorate, Jeb Bush wins 6% and every other candidate falls below the margin of error.
Of course, a requisite reminder that national polls do not really matter at this stage in the primary race, but given Trump's standing in the most recent polls in first-in-the-nation states like Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, Zogby's results may force the rest of the crowded field of Republican candidates - and the rest of the Republican party, for that matter - to contend with the potential reality of a Donald Trump nomination.

 The Guardian's Adam Gabbatt, sensing Liveblog Scott's tedium, has gifted us with a report on the pre-event buildup ahead of Hillary Clinton's dual appearance in Iowa City with singer/songwriter/actress/model/general icon Demi Lovato. 
According to Gabbatt, Lovato doesn't necessarily have the same fervent following among Hawkeye State politicos as she does among, say, twentysomething gay men in New York City:

Hillary Clinton's event in Iowa City hasn't even begun yet, but some members of the crowd are already in high spirits. The concert hall was almost full thirty minutes before Clinton and pop sensation Demi Lovato were due to appear.
Outside the hall, people at the back of snaking line that they faced a 55-minute wait to get in. 
Jennifer Ettinger, 18, stood dancing at the back of the crowd at 6:30pm. Her friend Avery Rice, 19, was filming a Snapchat video.
"She's a really good dancer, " Rice said of her companion. "She did ballet in high school."
Rice, a first-year student studying business, said she was there primarily to see Clinton. "I like her. I think she would be good in office," she said. "She's a cool girl." 
Neither of the women were huge Demi Lovato fans. "She's, like, fine," Rice said. ( Ed. : What.)
 "Who even is Demi Lovato?" Ettinger asked of the singer who has, quite literally, leant her voice to the Clinton campaign. ( Ed. : No, seriously. WHAT.)
"She was on the Disney Channel," Avery said.
Ettinger said she would have preferred to see Justin Bieber perform. "This place would be so packed if it was Justin Bieber," she said.

The Guardian's Ben Jacobs files from a Ben Carson campaign event in Glenwood, Iowa, where the neurosurgeon declared that any military veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder had better bring a doctor's note to the VA if they want to be treated:
Ben Carson indicated that he might be willing to deny support for PTSD to anyone in the military  who is an undocumented immigrant.
In a gaggle in Glenwood, Iowa on Thursday, Carson was asked about Sarah Palin blaming her son Track's PTSD on Barack Obama. After making clear that "I probably wouldn't do that, but then again I am not big blamer," the retired neurosurgeon then discussed the importance of providing those in the military support of potential PTSD. "All of our troops, anyone who signs up for volunteer military, should have a support group that works for them in their entire military career, particularly when they are in combat."
When Carson was asked whether this support should be extended to those in the military who are undocumented immigrants, however, he seemed hesitant to do so. After he said "I personally don't believe anyone who is illegally in the us should be in our military," Carson added he thought PTSD support groups to illegal immigrants serving in the US military should "be looked at on a case-by-case basis."

 The Guardian's David Smith trailed Ted Cruz in New Hampshire today, where the Texas senator juggled Star Wars fans and Bible thumping primary voters in the same afternoon - and pledged to hold a pig roast on the White House lawn: Ted Cruz has been showing his protean talents in New Hampshire, first quipping about Hollywood movies with students at a university campus, then referencing the Bible with a working-class audience in a pizza joint.

The Texas senator was presented with a $5 plastic lightsaber by Andrew Slack, 36, a civic activist and self-described "director of the US rebel alliance". Cruz, himself a Star Wars fan, played along. He said Han Solo was the coolest character in cinema and anyone who believes Luke Skywalker is instead should be disqualified from running for president.
But he disappointed Slack by refusing to take a "Jedi pledge" to "blow up the Death Star" of Citizens United, the supreme court's 2010 ruling that allowed corporations and unions to spend unlimited money on campaigning and ushered in the rise of Super Pacs.
Cruz said it was a matter of free speech, explaining: "I think Michael Moore's movies are idiotic. But he's got a first amendment right to keep making idiotic movies."
Asked whom he would invite to a fantasy dinner party, Cruz mentioned Jesus Christ, Ronald Reagan, Winston Churchill, Martin Luther King and Elvis Presley. He also promised to hold a pig roast on the south lawn of the White House.
Afterwards he told journalists the Republican establishment is defecting from Marco Rubio to Donald Trump because of the latter's willingness to cut deals. "The establishment is saying the one guy who scares the heck out of us is Cruz, because Cruz will actually stand with the American people against the career politicians in both parties that get in bed with the lobbyists and special interests."
Trump has previously been a donor to the Clinton Foundation and supported Clinton and other leading Democrats, Cruz added. "Every day he is engaging in more and more personal attacks. I have no intention of responding. I like Donald Trump, I respect Donald Trump, I will continue to praise him personally, and so if he wants to engage in insults that's his prerogative. But I'm going to keep the focus on the issues of substance. I think policy distinctions are fair game."
The senator then made his way to Theo's pizza restaurant, which was standing-room only and in a more febrile mood. Cruz gave a bleaker account of the state of the nation, comparing it with Jimmy Carter's presidency in the 1970s but noting that this was followed by the glory years of Reagan and the timeworn "shining city on the hill".
He pledged to revoke Obama's executive orders and actions on gun control and other matters, launch an investigation into Planned Parenthood "and those horrible videos", protect religious liberty and " rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal ".
And that would just be his first day in office.
He would also move the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and "repeal every word of Obamacare". As for immigration, Cruz said slyly: "We're going to build a wall - and I got somebody in mind to build it." 
As placard-waving supporters voiced support, Cruz promised to defend the Supreme Court against a liberal majority of justices. Hillary Clinton, he warned, would seek to use it to tear down war memorials which would be "not so far" from removing crosses and stars of David from war graves.
He urged the crowd to pray for the nation and each encourage nine friends to vote for him on primary day. "Continue this awakening," he said.

The Guardian's Rupert Neate reports from the South Point resort and casino in Las Vegas, where billionaire frontrunner Donald Trump was stumping with the wind of two major polls at his back:
A lot of people came to see Donald Trump speak in a casino Las Vegas on Thursday, and he demanded the media take note of it. The leading Republican Presidential candidate called the press "scumbags at the back of the room" for, he said, consistently not showing the scale of the crowds that turn out to support his campaign rallies. 
enltrTrump, in brilliant pink tie, starts off by attacking the media as "scumbags". 'All they focus on is the protesters' pic.twitter.com/gjhlBwTGbv

At one point, Trump, who according to a new poll has captured a double-digit lead in Iowa a mere 11 days before the caucuses, halted his rambling speech until TV cameramen "turn around and show the crowd". "There's not been one shot of the crowd," he said. 
So many people (4,000, according to casino security) had turned out to see Trump speak that the casino opened up three overflow rooms to relay his speech on big screens. 
Many of those who turned out to see Trump had come from Shot Show, the gun industry trade show also being held in Las Vegas, and one of the biggest cheers came as the candidate pledged to "save the Second Amendment".
"You listen to Hillary, and you're not going to have a Second Amendment!"
Jerry Springer, 68, (yes his real name, I checked) was one of those who had taken a break from the gun fair to turn out for Trump. Even though not a big fan of Trump, Springer said he would support any Republican who can "take out Hillary". 
Springer, who wore a sticker on the back of his shirt reading "1.20.17 OBAMA'S LAST DAY IN OFFICE!", said Obama was "the worst president we have ever had".
"Why? He is changing this country away from what it was. He doesn't want people to pay for anything. He is giving away food stamps to everyone. He is making it so that people don't have to pay for anything, and it is people like us that have to pay for everything."

Trump, whose speech concentrated on his favourite topics of immigration, taxation and trade, said "we are being led by stupid people", and he wanted to lead the country to "make America great again". 
He had a lot of fans in the room, including Rhonda Settles, a small business owner who has lived in Vegas since 1975, said Trump was "awesome as usual". 
" The country is in a downward spiral, and Trump is the only one stepping up to the plate," she said. "He is the one we can believe he can make America great again. He has a proven record, even though not necessarily in politics."
Settles, who is African American, said she did not believe Trump was racist or prejudice, despite his description of Mexicans as criminals and rapists and his pledge to make Mexico pay for a wall along the border to prevent illegal immigration.
"Those were not negative [comments]," she said. "We have to protect our country, I don't think he has anything to do with prejudice or racism. It is about following the laws that exist, but the current government has not been following."
Settles conceded that Trump did not make any real promises in his 45 minute Vegas speech, but said: "We're at the point where we have to listen not to what they say but how they say it. Donald Trump is ringing true to a lot of people. I don't need to know every detail. I just need to trust him, and I do."
Sharon and Charles Wax, both in their eighties, are also strident Trump supports. "We think he's absolutely fabulous," said Sharon wearing a Trump hat, light-up bow tie and a t shirt showing her and Charles meeting Trump at a previous rally. "He thinks what Americans think, our country has gone down the tubes after eight years of Democrats. This is the only man who can bring trade back to America and, as he says, make America great again."

If Congress handed out superlatives at the end of every session - and if the continued drollery of the Miss America pageant is any indication, it should - Texas senator Ted Cruz would be in no danger of winning "Most Popular."
A new report from the Associated Press highlights Cruz's deep unpopularity within the US senate, calling him the "least-favorite colleague" of nearly every Republican senator. But the abhorrence for Cruz's personal politics and perceived grandstanding is giving way in the upper chamber to panic as members of the senate worry that Cruz's nomination could spell the end of the party's control of Congress.
   He came in like a wrecking ball...  
Orrin Hatch of Utah told the Associated Press that he has yet to see "any great desire on [Cruz's] part to really bring the party along with him, so that's something that worries me."
Representative Pete King of New York called Cruz a "fraud," saying that he couldn't name a single person in Washington "who gets this opposition from his own people.... I'm talking about people as conservative as he is who just can't stand him."
Richard Burr of North Carolina even reportedly told supporters at a campaign fundraiser that he would rather vote for socialist senator Bernie Sanders than Cruz. 
A few of the more glaring highlights that Cruz's detractors cite in their opposition:

Cruz implied that former senator Chuck Hagel had received compensation from North Korea during a confirmation hearing
His confrontation with the White House over the Affordable Care Act resulted in a 16-day government shutdown that Americans largely blamed on the Republican party
Last year, Cruz accused McConnell of lying about scheduling a vote on the Export-Import Bank in a speech on the senate floor
And who does the senate seem ready to crown as Miss Congeniality? Florida senator Marco Rubio, who has received the endorsement of four Republican members of the chamber.
Cruz has received none.

In Brooklyn, New York, the main industry is independent coffee shops and almond milk. In Brooklyn, Iowa, it is agriculture: corn, soy and dairy milk.
More than 2.5 million people live in Brooklyn, New York. Brooklyn, Iowa, has a population of 1,500 people. 
Oh - and in Brooklyn, New York, Bernie Sanders is wildly popular. Whereas in the Iowan Brooklyn, no one seems to like him very much.
"No," said Marcia Kilmer, 66, when I asked if she would be voting for Sanders. She was having her hair cut in Shear Expressions. "He's too old. I don't like his age." She likes Ted Cruz and Ben Carson.
"I do not, myself," said a woman in Brooklyn's pharmacy, when I asked if she liked Sanders.
"I'm not a big fan of spreading the wealth. I think you should get what you earn," said a man called Paul, when I asked him why he didn't like Sanders. Paul was sitting in Brooklyn's grocery store, Seaton's Flag Foods, with five friends. 
None of them supported Bernie Sanders.

 Reporting from the frosty snowfields of  Arendelle  Iowa, the Guardian's Ben Jacobs points out that the campaign's favorite pediatric neurosurgeon is well-protected - if not well supported:
Everyone remembers that Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have Secret Service protection - but a third candidate does as well.
Despite his precipitous fall in polls, Ben Carson still has Secret Service protection. The retired neurosurgeon was given Secret Service protection in November along with Trump, at a point when the two were still neck-and-neck in the polls. Secret Service protection is awarded based a mix of factors, including polling and the number of death threats received. Hillary Clinton has been entitled to a Secret Service detail since the start of the campaign and beyond, due to her status as a former first lady.
The result is a jarring juxtaposition as one arrives at a Carson event. Despite his diminishing standing in the polls and a crowd that is heavily composed of high school students eager for an excuse to leave class early, there are still agents in suits and earpieces alertly scanning the crowd and a magnetometer at the entrance to the event.

Vermont senator Bernie Sanders is becoming a bit of a cut-up on the campaign trail, to rave reviews from audiences, reports Washington Bureau chief Dan Roberts: 
One sign of growing confidence in the Bernie Sanders camp is his willingness to gently mock his reputation for quirky public speaking. In recent days we've had quips about his hair and dress sense that do much to endear him to young supporters, but today at Southern New Hampshire University he took on the reputation for giving lectures. "Let me a bit professorial here," said Sanders to laughter from the students. "Who knows the difference between real unemployment and official unemployment?", he asked, in an exchange that would not have been out of place in economics class.
The next assignment concerns the environment - a big theme here where Sanders was joined by campaigner Bill McKibben. "How does that relate to campaign finance?" asked the prof, before explaining his theory of the link between energy industry lobbying and climate change denial among Republicans.
 It's not all one way though. After he acknowledged being accused of "Santa Claus" tendencies, one student asks the six-million-dollar question about how Sanders can possibly achieve everything he is proposing. "What am I smoking, you mean?," he shot back to more laughter.
   A young Sanders supporter is in on the joke.  
(His answer, in case you were wondering, is that all radical change takes people by surprise.)

 More from the Cable News Network's polling apparatus... 
The same survey that showed Hillary Clinton with a devastating eight-point deficit in Iowa indicates additional good news for outsider candidates who are relatively new to their party of choice. Billionaire frontrunner Donald Trump holds a double-digit lead among likely Republican caucus-goers in the Hawkeye State, leading Texas senator Ted Cruz by eleven points, 37% to 26%. The survey, conducted earlier this week, finds Florida senator Marco Rubio in third place at 14%, the only other Republican candidate to hold double digits in the state.
Trump jumped four points since the same poll was conducted in late November/early December, while Cruz picked up six points. Fifty-four percent of likely Iowa voters see Trump as the most qualified candidate to handle the economy, and an outright majority of 51% say he's the best candidate on immigration. He even edges out Cruz on foreign policy, 27% to 25%, although among social conservatives, the Texas senator walks away with a leading 29% who are concerned about same-sex marriage and abortion.
Among the lower tier, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson "leads" with 6% - a quarter of the support he had among likely caucus-goers in October - with Jeb Bush and Mike Huckabee tied for fifth place at 3% each. Kentucky senator Rand Paul, who has put little energy in Iowa, is at 2%, while Chris Christie, Carly Fiorina, John Kasich and previous caucus-winner Rick Santorum each pull in only 1% support.
 Put another way: If supporters of the bottom eight candidates were to coalesce behind a single person, that candidate would be in third place.

 Hillary Clinton's latest Iowa poll numbers are borderline disastrous  
 CNN polls are officially on the Clinton hit list. 
With only 11 days to go before the Iowa caucuses, a new CNN/ORC poll released Thursday afternoon finds Vermont senator Bernie Sanders with an astonishing eight-point lead over Hillary Clinton in Iowa - 51% to 43%. It's a dramatic reversal of fortunes for the former secretary of state, who led Sanders by 18 points in the same poll last December, 54% to 36%.
The poll arrives on the heels of a CNN/WMUR poll released earlier this week that shows Sanders with a commanding 27-point lead in New Hampshire. A one-two loss in both Iowa, originally deemed safe Clinton territory, and New Hampshire could indicate an existential threat to the former secretary of state's candidacy.
 Key to Sanders' lead: voters who will be caucusing for the first time. Among Democrats who caucused in 2008, Clinton leads Sanders by a comfortable 17 points, 55% to 38%. The self-declared socialist can also credit his perceived authenticity on economic issues as a major factor in the surge in support. Likely caucus-goers told CNN that they trust Sanders over Clinton on the economy by 22 points - two in three surveyed said they felt he would do more for America's middle class. A mere 30% felt that way about Clinton.
It wasn't exclusively bad news for the former secretary of state, who leads on foreign policy among likely Iowa voters, viewed as more trustworthy on the issue by a margin of 40 points. Additionally, despite what appear to be massive weaknesses in early states, Clinton is seen as the candidate most likely to win the general election in November, 60% to 38%.

It may have flown under the radar, but an unexpectedly popular presidential candidate has picked up a huge (yuge?) endorsement from a vanguard of his adopted party's activist wing.
No, not Donald Trump. Obviously, you heard all about that endorsement.
 Vermont senator Bernie Sanders picked up the endorsement of The Nation, the oldest continuously published weekly magazine in the US and self-described "flagship of the left," earlier this month. Now, Katrina vanden Heuvel, The Nation's editor and publisher, has come out in an interview explaining the progressive magazine's decision to endorse a primary candidate for only the third time in its 150-year history.
"It is a statement of commitment to issues we believe in above all," said vanden Heuvel in the magazine's podcast Start Making Sense. Sanders, vanden Heuvel said, "lifts up, amplifies the issues that have animated The Nation over these last decades."
"The key issue... is inequality," she elaborated. "There are many kinds of inequality, but Bernie Sanders is an unbought and passionate fighter against a rigged system and metastasizing inequality, economic and political."
 "Above all, it was his commitment to exposing a rigged system" that prompted The Nation to give the self-declared socialist its endorsement in the Democratic primary.
An endorsement from The Nation is a rare event - the periodical has previously endorsed Ulysses S. Grant in 1868, Norman Thomas in 1943 and Franklin Delano Roosevelt in each of his four campaigns - and even rarer in a primary campaign. It's the second time that the magazine has endorsed Hillary Clinton's main rival in the Democratic primary, having bestowed the honor upon then-senator Barack Obama in 2008.
Listen to the full interview, in which vanden Heuvel (pronounced "VAN-din HOY-vul," in case you were stumped) praises Sanders' ability to raise millions almost exclusively from small donors, calling him "liberated" to pursue progressive policies without fear of political reprisal.

Despite some new polls showing Bernie Sanders ahead in New Hampshire by as much as 27 points, there is an air of realism at his first campaign stop since the latest surge captured headlines here, writes Guardian Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts: 
The meeting with seniors at the Peterborough community center reflected a conscious push by the campaign to bolster support among older voters, whose undeniable interest in the 74-year-old has been somewhat eclipsed by the more vocal enthusiasm Sanders generally receives from students and younger voters.
 "He cares about us older folks  - he is one of us you know," says Merry Stockwell, a volunteer who introduced the senator from neighbouring Vermont to this retirement community an hour or so north of Boston.
"I believe in what he is saying, I'm just not sure how much of it he is going to be able to achieve," said Ruth, a 68-year-old retired educator from the nearby town of Antrim, who is one of the many voters in the state still to make up their minds.
Though equally sceptical about Hillary Clinton - "Hillary has got a lot of baggage" - she shrugs when asked what might convince her that Sanders can realistically take on Republicans and win the White House.

"Rather than build on the progress we've made," Clinton continues, "[Sanders] wants to start over from scratch with a whole new system.

The Clinton camp is out with a new video in which foreign policy adviser Jake Sullivan picks apart what he says are flaws in rival Bernie Sanders' thinking on foreign policy. 
The video is a model of calm argumentation. Sullivan sits in a cubicle at what looks like campaign headquarters and speaks directly to camera. "I have the greatest respect for senator Sanders," he says, "but when you look at the rest of his ideas, they just don't make a lot of sense."  
The video follows the release on Tuesday of a letter sent by 10 former senior US diplomats and national security officials calling Sanders's foreign policy agenda "troubling" and "puzzling."
Sanders replied to the letter by pointing out that "on the crucial foreign policy issue of our time, it turns out that Secretary Clinton - with all of her experience - was wrong and I was right."

 Planned Parenthood: abortion will be 'defining issue'  
On the 43rd anniversary of Roe v Wade, Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richard s said there has never been a more important election for women's rights, writes the Guardian's Lauren Gambino: 
"There's never been an election in which Roe was more clearly on the ballot," Richards told reporters on Thursday. "I do think  it's going to be a defining issue  for voters all across the country."

At least one and as many as four supreme court appointments are likely to fall to the next president. A conservative majority could overturn Roe V Wade, the 1973 decision protecting a woman's right to choose.
"Young people in America cannot imagine, and are only now beginning to come to grips with the fact, that there are folks in this country who are either in elective office or are trying to get into elective office that would take away a right that has been the law of the land now for more than 40 years," Richards said. "It's been an enormous wake-up call."
Planned Parenthood has endorsed Hillary Clinton for president, the organization's first-ever primary endorsement in its century-long existence.
On Wednesday, Clinton's rival, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, deemed Planned Parenthood and the host of other liberal organizations and labor unions backing Clinton part of the "establishment".

Sanders said on MSNBC that his campaign is not only taking on Wall Street and the economic elite, but the "political establishment" as well.
"I have friends and supporters in the Human Rights Fund and Planned Parenthood," Sanders said, referring to two organizations that have endorsed Clinton. "But you know what? Hillary Clinton has been around there for a very, very long time. Some of these groups are, in fact, part of the establishment."
Clinton quickly hit back, defending Planned Parenthood: "I wish it were [establishment]. If it were part of the establishment, we wouldn't have to work so hard to protect it."

Donald Trump's lead in polling averages in New Hampshire is 20 points - but steadily strengthening s howings by Ohio governor John Kasich are creating buzz that he may have a shot in the Granite State.
    Momentum? In Concord Wednesday. Photograph: Darren McCollester/Getty Images   
"Kasich is banking on New Hampshire's peculiar primary rules, which allow independents to vote in the Republican primary," writes my colleague Scott Bixby. "His moderation is on full display during a week-long tour across bluer parts of the state - Kasich is stumping primarily in counties that Barack Obama won during the last presidential election. With 44% of the Granite State's voters registered as independents, Kasich has a huge (yuge?) opportunity with non-traditional GOP voters."
The  Kasich camp is out with a new ad i n which the candidate's wife, Karen Waldbillig, says, "We really need your help to keep this momentum going." It's a series of nice family scenes from the New Hampshire primary trail:

Presidential contender  Chris Christie has resisted demands to "smack" Donald Trump  as the Republican party establishment panics over the billionaire celebrity's seemingly unstoppable rise, writes the Guardian's David Smith:
... frustration is mounting amid fears that the Republican party could tear itself apart, yet only Jeb Bush has attacked Trump head on. Christie, hosting a town hall event in Derry, was confronted by a female US army veteran who asked: "When are you going to take the gloves off  and start smacking him around? You don't have much time."

Often described as pugnacious, Christie elicited audience laughter by replying: "You know, I think it's the first time in my political career that people have said to me you're not aggressive enough."
He went on: "Listen, you know when I will? When I think it makes sense to.  I'm not in this to just beat Donald Trump. I'm in this to become president of the United States and I'm going to make certain decisions about when I want to say what I'm going to say."

 Voters don't expect the nominating races to come out the way that current polling seems to indicate they may come out, writes Guardian US data editor Mona Chalabi. " Either Americans aren't watching polls or else they simply don't trust them," Mona writes:
A poll from Loras college this morning puts Donald Trump and Ted Cruz neck-and-neck, with just 1 percentage point separating them in Iowa. There's nothing particularly surprising about that finding - it's not far off the average across all Iowa polls, which has Trump at 28%, Cruz at 27% and Rubio trailing at 11%.
What's interesting though are the follow-up questions Loras included about expectations. When 1,000 likely 2016 caucus-goers were asked this month who they thought would win Iowa, 3 8% said Cruz while 29% said Trump.  
Those expectations were flipped for the national race, though, where 36% said they thought Trump would be the Republican nominee while only 21% thought Cruz would get the backing of the party.

On the Democrat side, a recent survey from YouGov points to a similar gap between expectations and polling data:  people think Sanders has much less of a chance in Iowa than polls suggest.  Overall, 51% expect Clinton to win Iowa and only 35% think Sanders can while polling averages suggest it will be a much closer race: 47% Clinton and 43% Sanders.

 Republican candidate Carly Fiorina has been accused of "ambushing" a group of children, after she ushered pre-schoolers, who were on a field trip to a botanical garden, into an anti-abortion rally in Des Moines, the Guardian's Adam Gabbatt reports: 
The alleged ambush occurred when Fiorina hosted a "right to life" forum at the Greater Des Moines botanical garden. Entering the rally, before a crowd of about 60 people, she directed around 15 young children towards a makeshift stage.

The problem, one parent said, was that the children's parents had not given Fiorina permission to have their children sit with her - in front of a huge banner bearing the image of an unborn foetus - while she talked about harvesting organs from aborted babies.
"The kids went there to see the plants," said Chris Beck, the father of four-year-old Chatham, one of the children Fiorina appeared with. "She ambushed my son's field trip."

Hello and welcome to our live-wire, minute-to-minute coverage of the 2016 presidential election. 
It's an interesting mix today, with Guardian reporters following Hillary Clinton and Ben Carson in Iowa, Donald Trump and Bill Clinton in Nevada and no fewer than four Republican candidates in New Hampshire - Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz. Democrat Bernie Sanders is also campaigning in the Granite State.
 In a new ad to air in Iowa, Sanders has gone full Simon & Garfunkel:
   America was released 48 years ago.  
Donald Trump dished last night on CNN on what it was like to stand next to Sarah Palin during the rambling 20-minute speech she gave to endorse him on Tuesday. 
 "I didn't know it was going to be quite that long,"  Trump said.
... but she made a beautiful, you know, she made a very good speech. No, I wasn't uncomfortable - I was very happy. I would have normally left the stage and let her speak ... I thought it would be disrespectful to her if I left the stage. So, no, I wasn't uncomfortable at all."
He doesn't look uncomfortable in this mashup:
Trump spent part of Wednesday hammering Texas senator Ted Cruz, seemingly his closest rival in Iowa, which votes in just 11 days' time. 
This morning it appears the Republican establishment has picked a horse in the Trump-Cruz race - and it is Trump.  Bob Dole, the former senator and presidential nominee, told the New York Times Republicans would suffer "cataclysmic" losses with Cruz and that Trump would be better.
 Trent Lott, the former Senate majority  leader, told the Atlantic he'd take Trump over Cruz if he had to choose. Trump himself pointed out that "Everybody dislikes [Cruz]. I mean, he's a nasty guy that everybody dislikes."
 Cruz hit back, saying there actually is a new alignment between Trump and the establishment - difficult to argue, except in the case of a Trump-Cruz race - and trying to use it against Trump.
"Right now the Washington establishment is  abandoning Marco Rubio, they made an assessment that Marco can't win this race, and the Washington establishment is rushing over to support Donald Trump," Cruz told Politico. 
We're seeing that happen every day and Mr Trump is welcoming the support of the Washington establishment.

We have Demi Lovato! She walked into the hall to applause before joining her band - accoustic guitar, keyboard, drums - on stage.
"Hello. My name is Demi. I'm so excited to be here!" Lovato said, with typical grace and modesty.
With that she launched into a rousing rendition of recent hit Confident, from the 2015 album of the same name. ( Ed. : Yaaass.)
The crowd - and I - went wild.
"I don't think there is a woman more confident than Hillary Clinton," Lovato said afterwards.
Lovato, who was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on August 20 1992, then performed Stone Cold. The song is the fifth track on her album Confident, which peaked at number 11 on the Billboard top 100 chart. The album's eponymous song went platinum.
"I've got one more song for you guys, and the title of this song is why everyone should vote!" Lovato then told her adoring audience.
The song was Yes, the tenth track from Confident. Confident received a 4.5 star rating (out of five stars) upon its release last October.
A mesmerizing performance.

 More good polling news for Donald Trump: A Zogby Analytics poll of likely Republican primary voters shows the billionaire frontrunner receiving the support of a whopping 45% of the national primary electorate, leading Texas senator Ted Cruz by 32 points.
According to Zogby, Trump polls wins the lion's share of male Republican voters with 49% support, women with 41%, as well as Republicans overall with 47%. He also takes 49% of independents - who can only vote in certain primaries, including the Iowa caucuses - 46% of self-described conservatives and 45% of self-described moderates.
In speculative head-to head matchups, Trump beats Cruz 59% to 29%, Florida senator Marco Rubio 64% to 27%, former Florida governor Jeb(!) Bush 68% to 22%, Ohio governor John Kasich 73% to 15% and New Jersey governor Chris Christie 69% to 19%.
It's what former president George W. Bush might call " a thumpin'."
Behind Cruz's distant second-place support at 13%, Rubio commands 8% of the national primary electorate, Jeb Bush wins 6% and every other candidate falls below the margin of error.
Of course, a requisite reminder that national polls do not really matter at this stage in the primary race, but given Trump's standing in the most recent polls in first-in-the-nation states like Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, Zogby's results may force the rest of the crowded field of Republican candidates - and the rest of the Republican party, for that matter - to contend with the potential reality of a Donald Trump nomination.

Hillary Clinton's event in Iowa City hasn't even begun yet, but some members of the crowd are already in high spirits. The concert hall was almost full thirty minutes before Clinton and pop sensation Demi Lovato were due to appear.
Outside the hall, people at the back of snaking line that they faced a 55-minute wait to get in. 
Jennifer Ettinger, 18, stood dancing at the back of the crowd at 6:30pm. Her friend Avery Rice, 19, was filming a Snapchat video.
"She's a really good dancer, " Rice said of her companion. "She did ballet in high school."
Rice, a first-year student studying business, said she was there primarily to see Clinton. "I like her. I think she would be good in office," she said. "She's a cool girl." 
Neither of the women were huge Demi Lovato fans. "She's, like, fine," Rice said. ( Ed. : What.)
 "Who even is Demi Lovato?" Ettinger asked of the singer who has, quite literally, leant her voice to the Clinton campaign. ( Ed. : No, seriously. WHAT.)
"She was on the Disney Channel," Avery said.
Ettinger said she would have preferred to see Justin Bieber perform. "This place would be so packed if it was Justin Bieber," she said.

The Guardian's Ben Jacobs files from a Ben Carson campaign event in Glenwood, Iowa, where the neurosurgeon declared that any military veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder had better bring a doctor's note to the VA if they want to be treated:
Ben Carson indicated that he might be willing to deny support for PTSD to anyone in the military  who is an undocumented immigrant.
In a gaggle in Glenwood, Iowa on Thursday, Carson was asked about Sarah Palin blaming her son Track's PTSD on Barack Obama. After making clear that "I probably wouldn't do that, but then again I am not big blamer," the retired neurosurgeon then discussed the importance of providing those in the military support of potential PTSD. "All of our troops, anyone who signs up for volunteer military, should have a support group that works for them in their entire military career, particularly when they are in combat."
When Carson was asked whether this support should be extended to those in the military who are undocumented immigrants, however, he seemed hesitant to do so. After he said "I personally don't believe anyone who is illegally in the us should be in our military," Carson added he thought PTSD support groups to illegal immigrants serving in the US military should "be looked at on a case-by-case basis."

 The Guardian's David Smith trailed Ted Cruz in New Hampshire today, where the Texas senator juggled Star Wars fans and Bible thumping primary voters in the same afternoon - and pledged to hold a pig roast on the White House lawn: Ted Cruz has been showing his protean talents in New Hampshire, first quipping about Hollywood movies with students at a university campus, then referencing the Bible with a working-class audience in a pizza joint.

The Texas senator was presented with a $5 plastic lightsaber by Andrew Slack, 36, a civic activist and self-described "director of the US rebel alliance". Cruz, himself a Star Wars fan, played along. He said Han Solo was the coolest character in cinema and anyone who believes Luke Skywalker is instead should be disqualified from running for president.
But he disappointed Slack by refusing to take a "Jedi pledge" to "blow up the Death Star" of Citizens United, the supreme court's 2010 ruling that allowed corporations and unions to spend unlimited money on campaigning and ushered in the rise of Super Pacs.
Cruz said it was a matter of free speech, explaining: "I think Michael Moore's movies are idiotic. But he's got a first amendment right to keep making idiotic movies."
Asked whom he would invite to a fantasy dinner party, Cruz mentioned Jesus Christ, Ronald Reagan, Winston Churchill, Martin Luther King and Elvis Presley. He also promised to hold a pig roast on the south lawn of the White House.
Afterwards he told journalists the Republican establishment is defecting from Marco Rubio to Donald Trump because of the latter's willingness to cut deals. "The establishment is saying the one guy who scares the heck out of us is Cruz, because Cruz will actually stand with the American people against the career politicians in both parties that get in bed with the lobbyists and special interests."
Trump has previously been a donor to the Clinton Foundation and supported Clinton and other leading Democrats, Cruz added. "Every day he is engaging in more and more personal attacks. I have no intention of responding. I like Donald Trump, I respect Donald Trump, I will continue to praise him personally, and so if he wants to engage in insults that's his prerogative. But I'm going to keep the focus on the issues of substance. I think policy distinctions are fair game."
The senator then made his way to Theo's pizza restaurant, which was standing-room only and in a more febrile mood. Cruz gave a bleaker account of the state of the nation, comparing it with Jimmy Carter's presidency in the 1970s but noting that this was followed by the glory years of Reagan and the timeworn "shining city on the hill".
He pledged to revoke Obama's executive orders and actions on gun control and other matters, launch an investigation into Planned Parenthood "and those horrible videos", protect religious liberty and " rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal ".
And that would just be his first day in office.
He would also move the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and "repeal every word of Obamacare". As for immigration, Cruz said slyly: "We're going to build a wall - and I got somebody in mind to build it." 
As placard-waving supporters voiced support, Cruz promised to defend the Supreme Court against a liberal majority of justices. Hillary Clinton, he warned, would seek to use it to tear down war memorials which would be "not so far" from removing crosses and stars of David from war graves.
He urged the crowd to pray for the nation and each encourage nine friends to vote for him on primary day. "Continue this awakening," he said.

The Guardian's Rupert Neate reports from the South Point resort and casino in Las Vegas, where billionaire frontrunner Donald Trump was stumping with the wind of two major polls at his back:
A lot of people came to see Donald Trump speak in a casino Las Vegas on Thursday, and he demanded the media take note of it. The leading Republican Presidential candidate called the press "scumbags at the back of the room" for, he said, consistently not showing the scale of the crowds that turn out to support his campaign rallies.

At one point, Trump, who according to a new poll has captured a double-digit lead in Iowa a mere 11 days before the caucuses, halted his rambling speech until TV cameramen "turn around and show the crowd". "There's not been one shot of the crowd," he said. 
So many people (4,000, according to casino security) had turned out to see Trump speak that the casino opened up three overflow rooms to relay his speech on big screens. 
Many of those who turned out to see Trump had come from Shot Show, the gun industry trade show also being held in Las Vegas, and one of the biggest cheers came as the candidate pledged to "save the Second Amendment".
"You listen to Hillary, and you're not going to have a Second Amendment!"
Jerry Springer, 68, (yes his real name, I checked) was one of those who had taken a break from the gun fair to turn out for Trump. Even though not a big fan of Trump, Springer said he would support any Republican who can "take out Hillary". 
Springer, who wore a sticker on the back of his shirt reading "1.20.17 OBAMA'S LAST DAY IN OFFICE!", said Obama was "the worst president we have ever had".
"Why? He is changing this country away from what it was. He doesn't want people to pay for anything. He is giving away food stamps to everyone. He is making it so that people don't have to pay for anything, and it is people like us that have to pay for everything."

Trump, whose speech concentrated on his favourite topics of immigration, taxation and trade, said "we are being led by stupid people", and he wanted to lead the country to "make America great again". 
He had a lot of fans in the room, including Rhonda Settles, a small business owner who has lived in Vegas since 1975, said Trump was "awesome as usual". 
" The country is in a downward spiral, and Trump is the only one stepping up to the plate," she said. "He is the one we can believe he can make America great again. He has a proven record, even though not necessarily in politics."
Settles, who is African American, said she did not believe Trump was racist or prejudice, despite his description of Mexicans as criminals and rapists and his pledge to make Mexico pay for a wall along the border to prevent illegal immigration.
"Those were not negative [comments]," she said. "We have to protect our country, I don't think he has anything to do with prejudice or racism. It is about following the laws that exist, but the current government has not been following."
Settles conceded that Trump did not make any real promises in his 45 minute Vegas speech, but said: "We're at the point where we have to listen not to what they say but how they say it. Donald Trump is ringing true to a lot of people. I don't need to know every detail. I just need to trust him, and I do."
Sharon and Charles Wax, both in their eighties, are also strident Trump supports. "We think he's absolutely fabulous," said Sharon wearing a Trump hat, light-up bow tie and a t shirt showing her and Charles meeting Trump at a previous rally. "He thinks what Americans think, our country has gone down the tubes after eight years of Democrats. This is the only man who can bring trade back to America and, as he says, make America great again."

If Congress handed out superlatives at the end of every session - and if the continued drollery of the Miss America pageant is any indication, it should - Texas senator Ted Cruz would be in no danger of winning "Most Popular."
A new report from the Associated Press highlights Cruz's deep unpopularity within the US senate, calling him the "least-favorite colleague" of nearly every Republican senator. But the abhorrence for Cruz's personal politics and perceived grandstanding is giving way in the upper chamber to panic as members of the senate worry that Cruz's nomination could spell the end of the party's control of Congress.
   He came in like a wrecking ball...  
Orrin Hatch of Utah told the Associated Press that he has yet to see "any great desire on [Cruz's] part to really bring the party along with him, so that's something that worries me."
Representative Pete King of New York called Cruz a "fraud," saying that he couldn't name a single person in Washington "who gets this opposition from his own people.... I'm talking about people as conservative as he is who just can't stand him."
Richard Burr of North Carolina even reportedly told supporters at a campaign fundraiser that he would rather vote for socialist senator Bernie Sanders than Cruz. 
A few of the more glaring highlights that Cruz's detractors cite in their opposition:

Cruz implied that former senator Chuck Hagel had received compensation from North Korea during a confirmation hearing
His confrontation with the White House over the Affordable Care Act resulted in a 16-day government shutdown that Americans largely blamed on the Republican party
Last year, Cruz accused McConnell of lying about scheduling a vote on the Export-Import Bank in a speech on the senate floor
And who does the senate seem ready to crown as Miss Congeniality? Florida senator Marco Rubio, who has received the endorsement of four Republican members of the chamber.
Cruz has received none.

In Brooklyn, New York, the main industry is independent coffee shops and almond milk. In Brooklyn, Iowa, it is agriculture: corn, soy and dairy milk.
More than 2.5 million people live in Brooklyn, New York. Brooklyn, Iowa, has a population of 1,500 people. 
Oh - and in Brooklyn, New York, Bernie Sanders is wildly popular. Whereas in the Iowan Brooklyn, no one seems to like him very much.
"No," said Marcia Kilmer, 66, when I asked if she would be voting for Sanders. She was having her hair cut in Shear Expressions. "He's too old. I don't like his age." She likes Ted Cruz and Ben Carson.
"I do not, myself," said a woman in Brooklyn's pharmacy, when I asked if she liked Sanders.
"I'm not a big fan of spreading the wealth. I think you should get what you earn," said a man called Paul, when I asked him why he didn't like Sanders. Paul was sitting in Brooklyn's grocery store, Seaton's Flag Foods, with five friends. 
None of them supported Bernie Sanders. 
Stay tuned for more updates from Brooklyn, Iowa...

 Reporting from the frosty snowfields of  Arendelle  Iowa, the Guardian's Ben Jacobs points out that the campaign's favorite pediatric neurosurgeon is well-protected - if not well supported:
Everyone remembers that Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have Secret Service protection - but a third candidate does as well.
Despite his precipitous fall in polls, Ben Carson still has Secret Service protection. The retired neurosurgeon was given Secret Service protection in November along with Trump, at a point when the two were still neck-and-neck in the polls. Secret Service protection is awarded based a mix of factors, including polling and the number of death threats received. Hillary Clinton has been entitled to a Secret Service detail since the start of the campaign and beyond, due to her status as a former first lady.
The result is a jarring juxtaposition as one arrives at a Carson event. Despite his diminishing standing in the polls and a crowd that is heavily composed of high school students eager for an excuse to leave class early, there are still agents in suits and earpieces alertly scanning the crowd and a magnetometer at the entrance to the event.

Vermont senator Bernie Sanders is becoming a bit of a cut-up on the campaign trail, to rave reviews from audiences, reports Washington Bureau chief Dan Roberts: 
One sign of growing confidence in the Bernie Sanders camp is his willingness to gently mock his reputation for quirky public speaking. In recent days we've had quips about his hair and dress sense that do much to endear him to young supporters, but today at Southern New Hampshire University he took on the reputation for giving lectures. "Let me a bit professorial here," said Sanders to laughter from the students. "Who knows the difference between real unemployment and official unemployment?", he asked, in an exchange that would not have been out of place in economics class.
The next assignment concerns the environment - a big theme here where Sanders was joined by campaigner Bill McKibben. "How does that relate to campaign finance?" asked the prof, before explaining his theory of the link between energy industry lobbying and climate change denial among Republicans.
 It's not all one way though. After he acknowledged being accused of "Santa Claus" tendencies, one student asks the six-million-dollar question about how Sanders can possibly achieve everything he is proposing. "What am I smoking, you mean?," he shot back to more laughter.
   A young Sanders supporter is in on the joke.  
(His answer, in case you were wondering, is that all radical change takes people by surprise.)

 More from the Cable News Network's polling apparatus... 
The same survey that showed Hillary Clinton with a devastating eight-point deficit in Iowa indicates additional good news for outsider candidates who are relatively new to their party of choice. Billionaire frontrunner Donald Trump holds a double-digit lead among likely Republican caucus-goers in the Hawkeye State, leading Texas senator Ted Cruz by eleven points, 37% to 26%. The survey, conducted earlier this week, finds Florida senator Marco Rubio in third place at 14%, the only other Republican candidate to hold double digits in the state.
Trump jumped four points since the same poll was conducted in late November/early December, while Cruz picked up six points. Fifty-four percent of likely Iowa voters see Trump as the most qualified candidate to handle the economy, and an outright majority of 51% say he's the best candidate on immigration. He even edges out Cruz on foreign policy, 27% to 25%, although among social conservatives, the Texas senator walks away with a leading 29% who are concerned about same-sex marriage and abortion.
Among the lower tier, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson "leads" with 6% - a quarter of the support he had among likely caucus-goers in October - with Jeb Bush and Mike Huckabee tied for fifth place at 3% each. Kentucky senator Rand Paul, who has put little energy in Iowa, is at 2%, while Chris Christie, Carly Fiorina, John Kasich and previous caucus-winner Rick Santorum each pull in only 1% support.
 Put another way: If supporters of the bottom eight candidates were to coalesce behind a single person, that candidate would be in third place.

 Hillary Clinton's latest Iowa poll numbers are borderline disastrous  
 CNN polls are officially on the Clinton hit list. 
With only 11 days to go before the Iowa caucuses, a new CNN/ORC poll released Thursday afternoon finds Vermont senator Bernie Sanders with an astonishing eight-point lead over Hillary Clinton in Iowa - 51% to 43%. It's a dramatic reversal of fortunes for the former secretary of state, who led Sanders by 18 points in the same poll last December, 54% to 36%.
The poll arrives on the heels of a CNN/WMUR poll released earlier this week that shows Sanders with a commanding 27-point lead in New Hampshire. A one-two loss in both Iowa, originally deemed safe Clinton territory, and New Hampshire could indicate an existential threat to the former secretary of state's candidacy.
 Key to Sanders' lead: voters who will be caucusing for the first time. Among Democrats who caucused in 2008, Clinton leads Sanders by a comfortable 17 points, 55% to 38%. The self-declared socialist can also credit his perceived authenticity on economic issues as a major factor in the surge in support. Likely caucus-goers told CNN that they trust Sanders over Clinton on the economy by 22 points - two in three surveyed said they felt he would do more for America's middle class. A mere 30% felt that way about Clinton.
It wasn't exclusively bad news for the former secretary of state, who leads on foreign policy among likely Iowa voters, viewed as more trustworthy on the issue by a margin of 40 points. Additionally, despite what appear to be massive weaknesses in early states, Clinton is seen as the candidate most likely to win the general election in November, 60% to 38%.

It may have flown under the radar, but an unexpectedly popular presidential candidate has picked up a huge (yuge?) endorsement from a vanguard of his adopted party's activist wing.
No, not Donald Trump. Obviously, you heard all about that endorsement.
 Vermont senator Bernie Sanders picked up the endorsement of The Nation, the oldest continuously published weekly magazine in the US and self-described "flagship of the left," earlier this month. Now, Katrina vanden Heuvel, The Nation's editor and publisher, has come out in an interview explaining the progressive magazine's decision to endorse a primary candidate for only the third time in its 150-year history.
"It is a statement of commitment to issues we believe in above all," said vanden Heuvel in the magazine's podcast Start Making Sense. Sanders, vanden Heuvel said, "lifts up, amplifies the issues that have animated The Nation over these last decades."
"The key issue... is inequality," she elaborated. "There are many kinds of inequality, but Bernie Sanders is an unbought and passionate fighter against a rigged system and metastasizing inequality, economic and political."
 "Above all, it was his commitment to exposing a rigged system" that prompted The Nation to give the self-declared socialist its endorsement in the Democratic primary.
An endorsement from The Nation is a rare event - the periodical has previously endorsed Ulysses S. Grant in 1868, Norman Thomas in 1943 and Franklin Delano Roosevelt in each of his four campaigns - and even rarer in a primary campaign. It's the second time that the magazine has endorsed Hillary Clinton's main rival in the Democratic primary, having bestowed the honor upon then-senator Barack Obama in 2008.
Listen to the full interview, in which vanden Heuvel (pronounced "VAN-din HOY-vul," in case you were stumped) praises Sanders' ability to raise millions almost exclusively from small donors, calling him "liberated" to pursue progressive policies without fear of political reprisal.

Despite some new polls showing Bernie Sanders ahead in New Hampshire by as much as 27 points, there is an air of realism at his first campaign stop since the latest surge captured headlines here, writes Guardian Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts: 
The meeting with seniors at the Peterborough community center reflected a conscious push by the campaign to bolster support among older voters, whose undeniable interest in the 74-year-old has been somewhat eclipsed by the more vocal enthusiasm Sanders generally receives from students and younger voters.
 "He cares about us older folks  - he is one of us you know," says Merry Stockwell, a volunteer who introduced the senator from neighbouring Vermont to this retirement community an hour or so north of Boston.
"I believe in what he is saying, I'm just not sure how much of it he is going to be able to achieve," said Ruth, a 68-year-old retired educator from the nearby town of Antrim, who is one of the many voters in the state still to make up their minds.
Though equally sceptical about Hillary Clinton - "Hillary has got a lot of baggage" - she shrugs when asked what might convince her that Sanders can realistically take on Republicans and win the White House.

 Clinton sends army of surrogates to Iowa  
There's probably no one in the race who could (literally, not figuratively) win a shouting match against Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, whose trademark is a full-throated tirade against the billionaire class, writes the Guardian's Lauren Gambino: 
But locked in a tight race with just days to go before voting begins, Hillary Clinton is dispatching  actors, athletes, musicians, politicians, activists and family members across the Hawkeye state to help her turn up the volume on the campaign trail.
In lieu of the former secretary of state, Iowans can catch Juli·n Castro, former mayor of San Antonio and secretary of Housing and Urban Development; actress and activists Jamie Lee Curtis; athlete and activist Billie Jean King;  Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund; Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York; Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia; Stephanie Schriock, President of EMILY's List; Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey; and Scandal actor Tony Goldwyn.

 "Take health care,"  she says. "I want us to defend and build on the progress we have made under president Obama with the Affordable Care Act.... I want to keep going, keep expanding coverage to more people.
"We can get this done without another divisive debate about our entire health care system and without giving Republicans a window to tear down" what we've built. 
"Rather than build on the progress we've made," Clinton continues, "[Sanders] wants to start over from scratch with a whole new system.
"In theory, there's a lot to like about some of his ideas, but in t heory isn't enough.  A president has to deliver in reality."

The video follows the release on Tuesday of a letter sent by 10 former senior US diplomats and national security officials calling Sanders's foreign policy agenda "troubling" and "puzzling."
Sanders replied to the letter by pointing out that "on the crucial foreign policy issue of our time, it turns out that Secretary Clinton - with all of her experience - was wrong and I was right."

 Planned Parenthood: abortion will be 'defining issue'  
On the 43rd anniversary of Roe v Wade, Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richard s said there has never been a more important election for women's rights, writes the Guardian's Lauren Gambino: 
"There's never been an election in which Roe was more clearly on the ballot," Richards told reporters on Thursday. "I do think  it's going to be a defining issue  for voters all across the country."

At least one and as many as four supreme court appointments are likely to fall to the next president. A conservative majority could overturn Roe V Wade, the 1973 decision protecting a woman's right to choose.
"Young people in America cannot imagine, and are only now beginning to come to grips with the fact, that there are folks in this country who are either in elective office or are trying to get into elective office that would take away a right that has been the law of the land now for more than 40 years," Richards said. "It's been an enormous wake-up call."
Planned Parenthood has endorsed Hillary Clinton for president, the organization's first-ever primary endorsement in its century-long existence.
On Wednesday, Clinton's rival, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, deemed Planned Parenthood and the host of other liberal organizations and labor unions backing Clinton part of the "establishment".

Sanders said on MSNBC that his campaign is not only taking on Wall Street and the economic elite, but the "political establishment" as well.
"I have friends and supporters in the Human Rights Fund and Planned Parenthood," Sanders said, referring to two organizations that have endorsed Clinton. "But you know what? Hillary Clinton has been around there for a very, very long time. Some of these groups are, in fact, part of the establishment."
Clinton quickly hit back, defending Planned Parenthood: "I wish it were [establishment]. If it were part of the establishment, we wouldn't have to work so hard to protect it."

 Voters don't expect the nominating races to come out the way that current polling seems to indicate they may come out, writes Guardian US data editor Mona Chalabi. " Either Americans aren't watching polls or else they simply don't trust them," Mona writes:
A poll from Loras college this morning puts Donald Trump and Ted Cruz neck-and-neck, with just 1 percentage point separating them in Iowa. There's nothing particularly surprising about that finding - it's not far off the average across all Iowa polls, which has Trump at 28%, Cruz at 27% and Rubio trailing at 11%.
What's interesting though are the follow-up questions Loras included about expectations. When 1,000 likely 2016 caucus-goers were asked this month who they thought would win Iowa, 3 8% said Cruz while 29% said Trump.  
Those expectations were flipped for the national race, though, where 36% said they thought Trump would be the Republican nominee while only 21% thought Cruz would get the backing of the party.

On the Democrat side, a recent survey from YouGov points to a similar gap between expectations and polling data:  people think Sanders has much less of a chance in Iowa than polls suggest.  Overall, 51% expect Clinton to win Iowa and only 35% think Sanders can while polling averages suggest it will be a much closer race: 47% Clinton and 43% Sanders.

The alleged ambush occurred when Fiorina hosted a "right to life" forum at the Greater Des Moines botanical garden. Entering the rally, before a crowd of about 60 people, she directed around 15 young children towards a makeshift stage.

The problem, one parent said, was that the children's parents had not given Fiorina permission to have their children sit with her - in front of a huge banner bearing the image of an unborn foetus - while she talked about harvesting organs from aborted babies.
"The kids went there to see the plants," said Chris Beck, the father of four-year-old Chatham, one of the children Fiorina appeared with. "She ambushed my son's field trip."

Hello and welcome to our live-wire, minute-to-minute coverage of the 2016 presidential election. 
It's an interesting mix today, with Guardian reporters following Hillary Clinton and Ben Carson in Iowa, Donald Trump and Bill Clinton in Nevada and no fewer than four Republican candidates in New Hampshire - Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz. Democrat Bernie Sanders is also campaigning in the Granite State.
 In a new ad to air in Iowa, Sanders has gone full Simon & Garfunkel:
   America was released 48 years ago.  
Donald Trump dished last night on CNN on what it was like to stand next to Sarah Palin during the rambling 20-minute speech she gave to endorse him on Tuesday. 
 "I didn't know it was going to be quite that long,"  Trump said.
... but she made a beautiful, you know, she made a very good speech. No, I wasn't uncomfortable - I was very happy. I would have normally left the stage and let her speak ... I thought it would be disrespectful to her if I left the stage. So, no, I wasn't uncomfortable at all."
He doesn't look uncomfortable in this mashup:
Trump spent part of Wednesday hammering Texas senator Ted Cruz, seemingly his closest rival in Iowa, which votes in just 11 days' time. 
This morning it appears the Republican establishment has picked a horse in the Trump-Cruz race - and it is Trump.  Bob Dole, the former senator and presidential nominee, told the New York Times Republicans would suffer "cataclysmic" losses with Cruz and that Trump would be better.
 Trent Lott, the former Senate majority  leader, told the Atlantic he'd take Trump over Cruz if he had to choose. Trump himself pointed out that "Everybody dislikes [Cruz]. I mean, he's a nasty guy that everybody dislikes."
 Cruz hit back, saying there actually is a new alignment between Trump and the establishment - difficult to argue, except in the case of a Trump-Cruz race - and trying to use it against Trump.
"Right now the Washington establishment is  abandoning Marco Rubio, they made an assessment that Marco can't win this race, and the Washington establishment is rushing over to support Donald Trump," Cruz told Politico. 
We're seeing that happen every day and Mr Trump is welcoming the support of the Washington establishment.
In other news, Ben Carson resumes campaign activities today after the death on Tuesday of a volunteer, in a van crash.
At the state level, last night emails released to the public indicated that Michigan governor Rick Snyder was informed of water quality issues in the city of Flint as early as February 2015 but his administration struck a dismissive tone, saying the problems would eventually "fade in the rearview".

 The Guardian's Adam Gabbatt, sensing Liveblog Scott's tedium, has gifted us with a report on the pre-event buildup ahead of Hillary Clinton's dual appearance in Iowa City with singer/songwriter/actress/model/general icon Demi Lovato. 
According to Gabbatt, Lovato doesn't necessarily have the same fervent following among Hawkeye State politicos as she does among, say, twentysomething gay men in New York City:

Hillary Clinton's event in Iowa City hasn't even begun yet, but some members of the crowd are already in high spirits. The concert hall was almost full thirty minutes before Clinton and pop sensation Demi Lovato were due to appear.
Outside the hall, people at the back of snaking line that they faced a 55-minute wait to get in. 
Jennifer Ettinger, 18, stood dancing at the back of the crowd at 6:30pm. Her friend Avery Rice, 19, was filming a Snapchat video.
"She's a really good dancer, " Rice said of her companion. "She did ballet in high school."
Rice, a first-year student studying business, said she was there primarily to see Clinton. "I like her. I think she would be good in office," she said. "She's a cool girl." 
Neither of the women were huge Demi Lovato fans. "She's, like, fine," Rice said. ( Ed. : What.)
 "Who even is Demi Lovato?" Ettinger asked of the singer who has, quite literally, leant her voice to the Clinton campaign. ( Ed. : No, seriously. WHAT.)
"She was on the Disney Channel," Avery said.
Ettinger said she would have preferred to see Justin Bieber perform. "This place would be so packed if it was Justin Bieber," she said.

The Guardian's Ben Jacobs files from a Ben Carson campaign event in Glenwood, Iowa, where the neurosurgeon declared that any military veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder had better bring a doctor's note to the VA if they want to be treated:
Ben Carson indicated that he might be willing to deny support for PTSD to anyone in the military  who is an undocumented immigrant.
In a gaggle in Glenwood, Iowa on Thursday, Carson was asked about Sarah Palin blaming her son Track's PTSD on Barack Obama. After making clear that "I probably wouldn't do that, but then again I am not big blamer," the retired neurosurgeon then discussed the importance of providing those in the military support of potential PTSD. "All of our troops, anyone who signs up for volunteer military, should have a support group that works for them in their entire military career, particularly when they are in combat."
When Carson was asked whether this support should be extended to those in the military who are undocumented immigrants, however, he seemed hesitant to do so. After he said "I personally don't believe anyone who is illegally in the us should be in our military," Carson added he thought PTSD support groups to illegal immigrants serving in the US military should "be looked at on a case-by-case basis."

 The Guardian's David Smith trailed Ted Cruz in New Hampshire today, where the Texas senator juggled Star Wars fans and Bible thumping primary voters in the same afternoon - and pledged to hold a pig roast on the White House lawn: Ted Cruz has been showing his protean talents in New Hampshire, first quipping about Hollywood movies with students at a university campus, then referencing the Bible with a working-class audience in a pizza joint.

The Texas senator was presented with a $5 plastic lightsaber by Andrew Slack, 36, a civic activist and self-described "director of the US rebel alliance". Cruz, himself a Star Wars fan, played along. He said Han Solo was the coolest character in cinema and anyone who believes Luke Skywalker is instead should be disqualified from running for president.
But he disappointed Slack by refusing to take a "Jedi pledge" to "blow up the Death Star" of Citizens United, the supreme court's 2010 ruling that allowed corporations and unions to spend unlimited money on campaigning and ushered in the rise of Super Pacs.
Cruz said it was a matter of free speech, explaining: "I think Michael Moore's movies are idiotic. But he's got a first amendment right to keep making idiotic movies."
Asked whom he would invite to a fantasy dinner party, Cruz mentioned Jesus Christ, Ronald Reagan, Winston Churchill, Martin Luther King and Elvis Presley. He also promised to hold a pig roast on the south lawn of the White House.
Afterwards he told journalists the Republican establishment is defecting from Marco Rubio to Donald Trump because of the latter's willingness to cut deals. "The establishment is saying the one guy who scares the heck out of us is Cruz, because Cruz will actually stand with the American people against the career politicians in both parties that get in bed with the lobbyists and special interests."
Trump has previously been a donor to the Clinton Foundation and supported Clinton and other leading Democrats, Cruz added. "Every day he is engaging in more and more personal attacks. I have no intention of responding. I like Donald Trump, I respect Donald Trump, I will continue to praise him personally, and so if he wants to engage in insults that's his prerogative. But I'm going to keep the focus on the issues of substance. I think policy distinctions are fair game."
The senator then made his way to Theo's pizza restaurant, which was standing-room only and in a more febrile mood. Cruz gave a bleaker account of the state of the nation, comparing it with Jimmy Carter's presidency in the 1970s but noting that this was followed by the glory years of Reagan and the timeworn "shining city on the hill".
He pledged to revoke Obama's executive orders and actions on gun control and other matters, launch an investigation into Planned Parenthood "and those horrible videos", protect religious liberty and " rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal ".
And that would just be his first day in office.
He would also move the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and "repeal every word of Obamacare". As for immigration, Cruz said slyly: "We're going to build a wall - and I got somebody in mind to build it." 
As placard-waving supporters voiced support, Cruz promised to defend the Supreme Court against a liberal majority of justices. Hillary Clinton, he warned, would seek to use it to tear down war memorials which would be "not so far" from removing crosses and stars of David from war graves.
He urged the crowd to pray for the nation and each encourage nine friends to vote for him on primary day. "Continue this awakening," he said.

The Guardian's Rupert Neate reports from the South Point resort and casino in Las Vegas, where billionaire frontrunner Donald Trump was stumping with the wind of two major polls at his back:
A lot of people came to see Donald Trump speak in a casino Las Vegas on Thursday, and he demanded the media take note of it. The leading Republican Presidential candidate called the press "scumbags at the back of the room" for, he said, consistently not showing the scale of the crowds that turn out to support his campaign rallies. 
enltrTrump, in brilliant pink tie, starts off by attacking the media as "scumbags". 'All they focus on is the protesters' pic.twitter.com/gjhlBwTGbv

At one point, Trump, who according to a new poll has captured a double-digit lead in Iowa a mere 11 days before the caucuses, halted his rambling speech until TV cameramen "turn around and show the crowd". "There's not been one shot of the crowd," he said. 
So many people (4,000, according to casino security) had turned out to see Trump speak that the casino opened up three overflow rooms to relay his speech on big screens. 
Many of those who turned out to see Trump had come from Shot Show, the gun industry trade show also being held in Las Vegas, and one of the biggest cheers came as the candidate pledged to "save the Second Amendment".
"You listen to Hillary, and you're not going to have a Second Amendment!"
Jerry Springer, 68, (yes his real name, I checked) was one of those who had taken a break from the gun fair to turn out for Trump. Even though not a big fan of Trump, Springer said he would support any Republican who can "take out Hillary". 
Springer, who wore a sticker on the back of his shirt reading "1.20.17 OBAMA'S LAST DAY IN OFFICE!", said Obama was "the worst president we have ever had".
"Why? He is changing this country away from what it was. He doesn't want people to pay for anything. He is giving away food stamps to everyone. He is making it so that people don't have to pay for anything, and it is people like us that have to pay for everything."

Trump, whose speech concentrated on his favourite topics of immigration, taxation and trade, said "we are being led by stupid people", and he wanted to lead the country to "make America great again". 
He had a lot of fans in the room, including Rhonda Settles, a small business owner who has lived in Vegas since 1975, said Trump was "awesome as usual". 
" The country is in a downward spiral, and Trump is the only one stepping up to the plate," she said. "He is the one we can believe he can make America great again. He has a proven record, even though not necessarily in politics."
Settles, who is African American, said she did not believe Trump was racist or prejudice, despite his description of Mexicans as criminals and rapists and his pledge to make Mexico pay for a wall along the border to prevent illegal immigration.
"Those were not negative [comments]," she said. "We have to protect our country, I don't think he has anything to do with prejudice or racism. It is about following the laws that exist, but the current government has not been following."
Settles conceded that Trump did not make any real promises in his 45 minute Vegas speech, but said: "We're at the point where we have to listen not to what they say but how they say it. Donald Trump is ringing true to a lot of people. I don't need to know every detail. I just need to trust him, and I do."
Sharon and Charles Wax, both in their eighties, are also strident Trump supports. "We think he's absolutely fabulous," said Sharon wearing a Trump hat, light-up bow tie and a t shirt showing her and Charles meeting Trump at a previous rally. "He thinks what Americans think, our country has gone down the tubes after eight years of Democrats. This is the only man who can bring trade back to America and, as he says, make America great again."

If Congress handed out superlatives at the end of every session - and if the continued drollery of the Miss America pageant is any indication, it should - Texas senator Ted Cruz would be in no danger of winning "Most Popular."
A new report from the Associated Press highlights Cruz's deep unpopularity within the US senate, calling him the "least-favorite colleague" of nearly every Republican senator. But the abhorrence for Cruz's personal politics and perceived grandstanding is giving way in the upper chamber to panic as members of the senate worry that Cruz's nomination could spell the end of the party's control of Congress.
   He came in like a wrecking ball...  
Orrin Hatch of Utah told the Associated Press that he has yet to see "any great desire on [Cruz's] part to really bring the party along with him, so that's something that worries me."
Representative Pete King of New York called Cruz a "fraud," saying that he couldn't name a single person in Washington "who gets this opposition from his own people.... I'm talking about people as conservative as he is who just can't stand him."
Richard Burr of North Carolina even reportedly told supporters at a campaign fundraiser that he would rather vote for socialist senator Bernie Sanders than Cruz. 
A few of the more glaring highlights that Cruz's detractors cite in their opposition:

Cruz implied that former senator Chuck Hagel had received compensation from North Korea during a confirmation hearing
His confrontation with the White House over the Affordable Care Act resulted in a 16-day government shutdown that Americans largely blamed on the Republican party
Last year, Cruz accused McConnell of lying about scheduling a vote on the Export-Import Bank in a speech on the senate floor
And who does the senate seem ready to crown as Miss Congeniality? Florida senator Marco Rubio, who has received the endorsement of four Republican members of the chamber.
Cruz has received none.

In Brooklyn, New York, the main industry is independent coffee shops and almond milk. In Brooklyn, Iowa, it is agriculture: corn, soy and dairy milk.
More than 2.5 million people live in Brooklyn, New York. Brooklyn, Iowa, has a population of 1,500 people. 
Oh - and in Brooklyn, New York, Bernie Sanders is wildly popular. Whereas in the Iowan Brooklyn, no one seems to like him very much.
"No," said Marcia Kilmer, 66, when I asked if she would be voting for Sanders. She was having her hair cut in Shear Expressions. "He's too old. I don't like his age." She likes Ted Cruz and Ben Carson.
"I do not, myself," said a woman in Brooklyn's pharmacy, when I asked if she liked Sanders.
"I'm not a big fan of spreading the wealth. I think you should get what you earn," said a man called Paul, when I asked him why he didn't like Sanders. Paul was sitting in Brooklyn's grocery store, Seaton's Flag Foods, with five friends. 
None of them supported Bernie Sanders.

 Reporting from the frosty snowfields of  Arendelle  Iowa, the Guardian's Ben Jacobs points out that the campaign's favorite pediatric neurosurgeon is well-protected - if not well supported:
Everyone remembers that Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have Secret Service protection - but a third candidate does as well.
Despite his precipitous fall in polls, Ben Carson still has Secret Service protection. The retired neurosurgeon was given Secret Service protection in November along with Trump, at a point when the two were still neck-and-neck in the polls. Secret Service protection is awarded based a mix of factors, including polling and the number of death threats received. Hillary Clinton has been entitled to a Secret Service detail since the start of the campaign and beyond, due to her status as a former first lady.
The result is a jarring juxtaposition as one arrives at a Carson event. Despite his diminishing standing in the polls and a crowd that is heavily composed of high school students eager for an excuse to leave class early, there are still agents in suits and earpieces alertly scanning the crowd and a magnetometer at the entrance to the event.

Vermont senator Bernie Sanders is becoming a bit of a cut-up on the campaign trail, to rave reviews from audiences, reports Washington Bureau chief Dan Roberts: 
One sign of growing confidence in the Bernie Sanders camp is his willingness to gently mock his reputation for quirky public speaking. In recent days we've had quips about his hair and dress sense that do much to endear him to young supporters, but today at Southern New Hampshire University he took on the reputation for giving lectures. "Let me a bit professorial here," said Sanders to laughter from the students. "Who knows the difference between real unemployment and official unemployment?", he asked, in an exchange that would not have been out of place in economics class.
The next assignment concerns the environment - a big theme here where Sanders was joined by campaigner Bill McKibben. "How does that relate to campaign finance?" asked the prof, before explaining his theory of the link between energy industry lobbying and climate change denial among Republicans.
 It's not all one way though. After he acknowledged being accused of "Santa Claus" tendencies, one student asks the six-million-dollar question about how Sanders can possibly achieve everything he is proposing. "What am I smoking, you mean?," he shot back to more laughter.
   A young Sanders supporter is in on the joke.  
(His answer, in case you were wondering, is that all radical change takes people by surprise.)

 More from the Cable News Network's polling apparatus... 
The same survey that showed Hillary Clinton with a devastating eight-point deficit in Iowa indicates additional good news for outsider candidates who are relatively new to their party of choice. Billionaire frontrunner Donald Trump holds a double-digit lead among likely Republican caucus-goers in the Hawkeye State, leading Texas senator Ted Cruz by eleven points, 37% to 26%. The survey, conducted earlier this week, finds Florida senator Marco Rubio in third place at 14%, the only other Republican candidate to hold double digits in the state.
Trump jumped four points since the same poll was conducted in late November/early December, while Cruz picked up six points. Fifty-four percent of likely Iowa voters see Trump as the most qualified candidate to handle the economy, and an outright majority of 51% say he's the best candidate on immigration. He even edges out Cruz on foreign policy, 27% to 25%, although among social conservatives, the Texas senator walks away with a leading 29% who are concerned about same-sex marriage and abortion.
Among the lower tier, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson "leads" with 6% - a quarter of the support he had among likely caucus-goers in October - with Jeb Bush and Mike Huckabee tied for fifth place at 3% each. Kentucky senator Rand Paul, who has put little energy in Iowa, is at 2%, while Chris Christie, Carly Fiorina, John Kasich and previous caucus-winner Rick Santorum each pull in only 1% support.
 Put another way: If supporters of the bottom eight candidates were to coalesce behind a single person, that candidate would be in third place.

 Hillary Clinton's latest Iowa poll numbers are borderline disastrous  
 CNN polls are officially on the Clinton hit list. 
With only 11 days to go before the Iowa caucuses, a new CNN/ORC poll released Thursday afternoon finds Vermont senator Bernie Sanders with an astonishing eight-point lead over Hillary Clinton in Iowa - 51% to 43%. It's a dramatic reversal of fortunes for the former secretary of state, who led Sanders by 18 points in the same poll last December, 54% to 36%.
The poll arrives on the heels of a CNN/WMUR poll released earlier this week that shows Sanders with a commanding 27-point lead in New Hampshire. A one-two loss in both Iowa, originally deemed safe Clinton territory, and New Hampshire could indicate an existential threat to the former secretary of state's candidacy.
 Key to Sanders' lead: voters who will be caucusing for the first time. Among Democrats who caucused in 2008, Clinton leads Sanders by a comfortable 17 points, 55% to 38%. The self-declared socialist can also credit his perceived authenticity on economic issues as a major factor in the surge in support. Likely caucus-goers told CNN that they trust Sanders over Clinton on the economy by 22 points - two in three surveyed said they felt he would do more for America's middle class. A mere 30% felt that way about Clinton.
It wasn't exclusively bad news for the former secretary of state, who leads on foreign policy among likely Iowa voters, viewed as more trustworthy on the issue by a margin of 40 points. Additionally, despite what appear to be massive weaknesses in early states, Clinton is seen as the candidate most likely to win the general election in November, 60% to 38%.

It may have flown under the radar, but an unexpectedly popular presidential candidate has picked up a huge (yuge?) endorsement from a vanguard of his adopted party's activist wing.
No, not Donald Trump. Obviously, you heard all about that endorsement.
 Vermont senator Bernie Sanders picked up the endorsement of The Nation, the oldest continuously published weekly magazine in the US and self-described "flagship of the left," earlier this month. Now, Katrina vanden Heuvel, The Nation's editor and publisher, has come out in an interview explaining the progressive magazine's decision to endorse a primary candidate for only the third time in its 150-year history.
"It is a statement of commitment to issues we believe in above all," said vanden Heuvel in the magazine's podcast Start Making Sense. Sanders, vanden Heuvel said, "lifts up, amplifies the issues that have animated The Nation over these last decades."
"The key issue... is inequality," she elaborated. "There are many kinds of inequality, but Bernie Sanders is an unbought and passionate fighter against a rigged system and metastasizing inequality, economic and political."
 "Above all, it was his commitment to exposing a rigged system" that prompted The Nation to give the self-declared socialist its endorsement in the Democratic primary.
An endorsement from The Nation is a rare event - the periodical has previously endorsed Ulysses S. Grant in 1868, Norman Thomas in 1943 and Franklin Delano Roosevelt in each of his four campaigns - and even rarer in a primary campaign. It's the second time that the magazine has endorsed Hillary Clinton's main rival in the Democratic primary, having bestowed the honor upon then-senator Barack Obama in 2008.
Listen to the full interview, in which vanden Heuvel (pronounced "VAN-din HOY-vul," in case you were stumped) praises Sanders' ability to raise millions almost exclusively from small donors, calling him "liberated" to pursue progressive policies without fear of political reprisal.

Despite some new polls showing Bernie Sanders ahead in New Hampshire by as much as 27 points, there is an air of realism at his first campaign stop since the latest surge captured headlines here, writes Guardian Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts: 
The meeting with seniors at the Peterborough community center reflected a conscious push by the campaign to bolster support among older voters, whose undeniable interest in the 74-year-old has been somewhat eclipsed by the more vocal enthusiasm Sanders generally receives from students and younger voters.
 "He cares about us older folks  - he is one of us you know," says Merry Stockwell, a volunteer who introduced the senator from neighbouring Vermont to this retirement community an hour or so north of Boston.
"I believe in what he is saying, I'm just not sure how much of it he is going to be able to achieve," said Ruth, a 68-year-old retired educator from the nearby town of Antrim, who is one of the many voters in the state still to make up their minds.
Though equally sceptical about Hillary Clinton - "Hillary has got a lot of baggage" - she shrugs when asked what might convince her that Sanders can realistically take on Republicans and win the White House.

"We can get this done without another divisive debate about our entire health care system and without giving Republicans a window to tear down" what we've built. 
"Rather than build on the progress we've made," Clinton continues, "[Sanders] wants to start over from scratch with a whole new system.

The video follows the release on Tuesday of a letter sent by 10 former senior US diplomats and national security officials calling Sanders's foreign policy agenda "troubling" and "puzzling."
Sanders replied to the letter by pointing out that "on the crucial foreign policy issue of our time, it turns out that Secretary Clinton - with all of her experience - was wrong and I was right."

 Planned Parenthood: abortion will be 'defining issue'  
On the 43rd anniversary of Roe v Wade, Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richard s said there has never been a more important election for women's rights, writes the Guardian's Lauren Gambino: 
"There's never been an election in which Roe was more clearly on the ballot," Richards told reporters on Thursday. "I do think  it's going to be a defining issue  for voters all across the country."

At least one and as many as four supreme court appointments are likely to fall to the next president. A conservative majority could overturn Roe V Wade, the 1973 decision protecting a woman's right to choose.
"Young people in America cannot imagine, and are only now beginning to come to grips with the fact, that there are folks in this country who are either in elective office or are trying to get into elective office that would take away a right that has been the law of the land now for more than 40 years," Richards said. "It's been an enormous wake-up call."
Planned Parenthood has endorsed Hillary Clinton for president, the organization's first-ever primary endorsement in its century-long existence.
On Wednesday, Clinton's rival, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, deemed Planned Parenthood and the host of other liberal organizations and labor unions backing Clinton part of the "establishment".

Sanders said on MSNBC that his campaign is not only taking on Wall Street and the economic elite, but the "political establishment" as well.
"I have friends and supporters in the Human Rights Fund and Planned Parenthood," Sanders said, referring to two organizations that have endorsed Clinton. "But you know what? Hillary Clinton has been around there for a very, very long time. Some of these groups are, in fact, part of the establishment."
Clinton quickly hit back, defending Planned Parenthood: "I wish it were [establishment]. If it were part of the establishment, we wouldn't have to work so hard to protect it."

Donald Trump's lead in polling averages in New Hampshire is 20 points - but steadily strengthening s howings by Ohio governor John Kasich are creating buzz that he may have a shot in the Granite State.

"Kasich is banking on New Hampshire's peculiar primary rules, which allow independents to vote in the Republican primary," writes my colleague Scott Bixby. "His moderation is on full display during a week-long tour across bluer parts of the state - Kasich is stumping primarily in counties that Barack Obama won during the last presidential election. With 44% of the Granite State's voters registered as independents, Kasich has a huge (yuge?) opportunity with non-traditional GOP voters."

He went on: "Listen, you know when I will? When I think it makes sense to.  I'm not in this to just beat Donald Trump. I'm in this to become president of the United States and I'm going to make certain decisions about when I want to say what I'm going to say."

 Voters don't expect the nominating races to come out the way that current polling seems to indicate they may come out, writes Guardian US data editor Mona Chalabi. " Either Americans aren't watching polls or else they simply don't trust them," Mona writes:
A poll from Loras college this morning puts Donald Trump and Ted Cruz neck-and-neck, with just 1 percentage point separating them in Iowa. There's nothing particularly surprising about that finding - it's not far off the average across all Iowa polls, which has Trump at 28%, Cruz at 27% and Rubio trailing at 11%.
What's interesting though are the follow-up questions Loras included about expectations. When 1,000 likely 2016 caucus-goers were asked this month who they thought would win Iowa, 3 8% said Cruz while 29% said Trump.  
Those expectations were flipped for the national race, though, where 36% said they thought Trump would be the Republican nominee while only 21% thought Cruz would get the backing of the party.

On the Democrat side, a recent survey from YouGov points to a similar gap between expectations and polling data:  people think Sanders has much less of a chance in Iowa than polls suggest.  Overall, 51% expect Clinton to win Iowa and only 35% think Sanders can while polling averages suggest it will be a much closer race: 47% Clinton and 43% Sanders.

 Republican candidate Carly Fiorina has been accused of "ambushing" a group of children, after she ushered pre-schoolers, who were on a field trip to a botanical garden, into an anti-abortion rally in Des Moines, the Guardian's Adam Gabbatt reports: 
The alleged ambush occurred when Fiorina hosted a "right to life" forum at the Greater Des Moines botanical garden. Entering the rally, before a crowd of about 60 people, she directed around 15 young children towards a makeshift stage.

The problem, one parent said, was that the children's parents had not given Fiorina permission to have their children sit with her - in front of a huge banner bearing the image of an unborn foetus - while she talked about harvesting organs from aborted babies.
"The kids went there to see the plants," said Chris Beck, the father of four-year-old Chatham, one of the children Fiorina appeared with. "She ambushed my son's field trip."

Hello and welcome to our live-wire, minute-to-minute coverage of the 2016 presidential election. 
It's an interesting mix today, with Guardian reporters following Hillary Clinton and Ben Carson in Iowa, Donald Trump and Bill Clinton in Nevada and no fewer than four Republican candidates in New Hampshire - Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz. Democrat Bernie Sanders is also campaigning in the Granite State.
 In a new ad to air in Iowa, Sanders has gone full Simon & Garfunkel:
   America was released 48 years ago.  
Donald Trump dished last night on CNN on what it was like to stand next to Sarah Palin during the rambling 20-minute speech she gave to endorse him on Tuesday. 
 "I didn't know it was going to be quite that long,"  Trump said.
... but she made a beautiful, you know, she made a very good speech. No, I wasn't uncomfortable - I was very happy. I would have normally left the stage and let her speak ... I thought it would be disrespectful to her if I left the stage. So, no, I wasn't uncomfortable at all."
He doesn't look uncomfortable in this mashup:
Trump spent part of Wednesday hammering Texas senator Ted Cruz, seemingly his closest rival in Iowa, which votes in just 11 days' time. 
This morning it appears the Republican establishment has picked a horse in the Trump-Cruz race - and it is Trump.  Bob Dole, the former senator and presidential nominee, told the New York Times Republicans would suffer "cataclysmic" losses with Cruz and that Trump would be better.
 Trent Lott, the former Senate majority  leader, told the Atlantic he'd take Trump over Cruz if he had to choose. Trump himself pointed out that "Everybody dislikes [Cruz]. I mean, he's a nasty guy that everybody dislikes."
 Cruz hit back, saying there actually is a new alignment between Trump and the establishment - difficult to argue, except in the case of a Trump-Cruz race - and trying to use it against Trump.
"Right now the Washington establishment is  abandoning Marco Rubio, they made an assessment that Marco can't win this race, and the Washington establishment is rushing over to support Donald Trump," Cruz told Politico. 
We're seeing that happen every day and Mr Trump is welcoming the support of the Washington establishment.
In other news, Ben Carson resumes campaign activities today after the death on Tuesday of a volunteer, in a van crash.
At the state level, last night emails released to the public indicated that Michigan governor Rick Snyder was informed of water quality issues in the city of Flint as early as February 2015 but his administration struck a dismissive tone, saying the problems would eventually "fade in the rearview".

Pollock's wheelchair just broke, leaving him in a serious jam. But he was rescued by a technician who trudged through the snow to find him, and fix it.
And he only charged 20 francs. Quite a bargain, and proof that the world isn't all bad.

 Osborne: We've got to help China  
 We know that George Osborne is a big China fan. And he concluded the session on the Global Economic Outlook by urging global leaders to support Beijing. 
"The world has not been very good over previous centuries at accommodating rising powers," the chancellor warned.
"It is massively in our interests that we bring China into the multilateral institutions of the world.....and make it feel part of the global system."<end>
China really has dominated this year's World Economic Forum (along with the refugee crisis). Osborne's words may fall flat, though, if policymakers fumble the move to a more domestic-driven, consumer based economy. Especially if the credit bubble that has swelled over recent years bursts badly.

The subject of capital controls is very sensitive for the IMF because late last year it recommended the renminbi be admitted into the fund's elite basket of currencies, including the US dollar, euro, yen and sterling, on the grounds that it was now "widely used" and "freely usable". Capital controls would undermine both conditions.

George Osborne's comments won't spare Google from a grilling in parliament over the tax deal.
There is plenty of concern that £130m in back taxes is a rather meagre sum, for a company of Google's size and importance.
And the Public Accounts Committee is determined to dig into it.
Meg Hillier MP, chair of the PAC, said overnight that she was "shocked" by the workaround methods used by multinationals. It doesn't reflect well on the tax officials, either: 
"HMRC now needs to assure taxpayers that it will keep up the pressure to tackle whatever the next emerging issue is in real time, rather than years later.
"It is effectively admitting it pulled in too little tax from Google for nine out of ten years.
"This is not a great success rate and the Public Accounts Committee will be calling in HMRC and Google to explain.

 George Osborne: Google tax deal is a big success  
 George Osborne has told the Guardian that the £130m tax deal announced with Google overnight is a "huge step forward" 
Speaking to my colleagues Larry and Jill just after his panel debate in Davos, the chancellor said he regarded it as a major success for the government.
He told us:
This is a major success of our tax policy.
We've got Google to pay taxes and I think that is a huge step forward and addresses that perfectly legitimate public anger that large corporations have not been paying tax. I think it's a really positive step.
I hope to see more firms follow suit and of course I've introduced a diverted profits tax which will require this going forward. So I think it's a big step forward and a victory for the government".
Overnight, the search giant announced that it will pay £130m to the UK - a decade's worth of tax. It will also pay more taxes in the UK in future, as part of a shake-up of the way the multinational pays tax.
Osborne's comments at Davos come after Labour shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, criticised the deal.
My colleague Kevin Rawlinson reports:
People will be "sceptical" about what he said looked like a "sweetheart deal", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday, adding that HMRC seemed to have settled for a "relatively trivial amount of money."
McDonnell will be asking HMRC to publish full details of what it believed Google owed. He said he would raise the issue in Parliament next week as the issue needed "wider scrutiny".

China's authorities have been struggling to avoid excessive depreciation or appreciation of its currency while also maintaining an accommodative monetary stance.

Britain has three priorities through our EU renegotiation, says Osborne:

Want to address concerns about migration.
Mainstream governments should not ignore these pressure, but should address the legitimate concerns that can fuel them.
Thirdly, we need a better working relationship between euro and non-euro countries, and the fact that large countries such as the UK will not be in the eurozone.
There is a remorseless logic that the eurozone needs ever-closer union, and Britain does not want to be part of it, Osborne concludes.

We hope very much [there is a deal], as it would really be conducive to more stability and a more cohesive economic zone.
The second is the refugee crisis, which Lagarde calls a 'make-or-break' issue for Europe, Lagarde adds.
If it is well-handled and the integration process is handled well, it will be an upside for the eurozone, boosting growth particularly in Sweden and Germany.
So do you agree that the refugee crisis is 'make or break' for the Schengen area?

 Gideon Rachman, the Financial Times's top foreign affairs writer, reckons that this year's World Economic Forum has been dogged by the "shadow of populism": 
Davos delegates shouldn't be surprised that the public are looking at the state of the world economy, and the political landscape, and decide that a change is needed.
But the sort of populism promoted by Donald Trump is rather alien, and alarming, for those at WEF. 
Gideon writes:
The shadow of Donald Trump has loomed over Davos this year. So has the prospect that refugee flows into Europe will undermine centrist leaders such as Angela Merkel, the German chancellor. More broadly, those at Davos are aware that they increasingly represent the "unpopular" - the business and political elites that are the targets of public anger and disillusionment.
Sooner or later, most corridor conversations in Davos have turned to the US presidential election. It is gradually dawning on people in the Swiss resort that either Mr Trump or Ted Cruz, the Texas senator, will probably win the Republican nomination, and that the "unthinkable" - a Trump or Cruz victory in November's presidential election - could happen.

 Our economics editor Larry Elliott has been coming to Davos for two decades. And he writes that this year's meeting has been particulary dominated downbeat. 
For Justin Welby, mulling over the state of the world in Davos has been easier than the previous week spent trying to hammer out an Anglican church compromise over gay marriage. The Archbishop of Canterbury even cracked one of the better jokes at the World Economic Forum.
Asked whether god is in cyberspace, Welby replied: "I think he must be because every time I am on the underground or a bus I see people looking at their computer or mobile phone saying 'oh god, why won't this work'."
Humour has been in short supply at this year's Davos. The optimism of a year ago that the global economy was on the up after the deep slump of 2008-09 has disappeared fast....

 So, what have we learned from Davos this year? 
In a nutshell, the so-called 'global elite' are worried about a range of problems, and struggling to make much progress in solving them.
There's been no end of talk about refugees, market turmoil, oil, the risk of a new pandemic, and gender inequality. But no real sign that we're close to a breakthrough on any of it.
As one senior delegate put it, 2016 is going to be a year of shocks.

The AFP newswire has the details:
Twelve on-duty soldiers had tested positive on Tuesday for cannabis and five of them had also used cocaine, army spokesman Stefan Hofer told the ATS news agency.
The twelve, among some 4,500 soldiers brought in to ensure security at the World Economic Forum this week, had been tested after others in their unit raised the alarm.
Using drug-sniffing dogs, military police had also discovered that one of the soldiers had more than three grammes of cocaine in his possession, according to the report.

Just like the wicked, there's no rest for the world's global elite. So world leaders, CEOs, union chiefs, economists and journalists are gathering for the final act of the 2016 World Economic Forum.
There's a different feel in Davos today. Partly because it's Saturday, which means this gorgeous ski resort actually has some skiers here today, trudging through the snow alongside delegates.
And partly because after three days discussing the problems of the world economy, everyone's a bit shattered and ready to go home.
But not before the final big event, a debate on the world economy.

 Osborne: We've got to help China  
 We know that George Osborne is a big China fan. And he concluded the session on the Global Economic Outlook by urging global leaders to support Beijing. 
"The world has not been very good over previous centuries at accommodating rising powers," the chancellor warned.
"It is massively in our interests that we bring China into the multilateral institutions of the world.....and make it feel part of the global system."<end>
China really has dominated this year's World Economic Forum (along with the refugee crisis). Osborne's words may fall flat, though, if policymakers fumble the move to a more domestic-driven, consumer based economy. Especially if the credit bubble that has swelled over recent years bursts badly.

Bank of Japan governor Kuroda's suggestion today that China should impose capital controls highlights the pressure on Beijing. 
Chris Giles of the FT explains:
The subject of capital controls is very sensitive for the IMF because late last year it recommended the renminbi be admitted into the fund's elite basket of currencies, including the US dollar, euro, yen and sterling, on the grounds that it was now "widely used" and "freely usable". Capital controls would undermine both conditions.

George Osborne's comments won't spare Google from a grilling in parliament over the tax deal.
There is plenty of concern that £130m in back taxes is a rather meagre sum, for a company of Google's size and importance.
And the Public Accounts Committee is determined to dig into it.
Meg Hillier MP, chair of the PAC, said overnight that she was "shocked" by the workaround methods used by multinationals. It doesn't reflect well on the tax officials, either: 
"HMRC now needs to assure taxpayers that it will keep up the pressure to tackle whatever the next emerging issue is in real time, rather than years later.
"It is effectively admitting it pulled in too little tax from Google for nine out of ten years.
"This is not a great success rate and the Public Accounts Committee will be calling in HMRC and Google to explain.

 George Osborne: Google tax deal is a big success  
 George Osborne has told the Guardian that the £130m tax deal announced with Google overnight is a "huge step forward" 
Speaking to my colleagues Larry and Jill just after his panel debate in Davos, the chancellor said he regarded it as a major success for the government.
He told us:
This is a major success of our tax policy.
We've got Google to pay taxes and I think that is a huge step forward and addresses that perfectly legitimate public anger that large corporations have not been paying tax. I think it's a really positive step.
I hope to see more firms follow suit and of course I've introduced a diverted profits tax which will require this going forward. So I think it's a big step forward and a victory for the government".
Overnight, the search giant announced that it will pay £130m to the UK - a decade's worth of tax. It will also pay more taxes in the UK in future, as part of a shake-up of the way the multinational pays tax.
Osborne's comments at Davos come after Labour shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, criticised the deal.
My colleague Kevin Rawlinson reports:
People will be "sceptical" about what he said looked like a "sweetheart deal", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday, adding that HMRC seemed to have settled for a "relatively trivial amount of money."
McDonnell will be asking HMRC to publish full details of what it believed Google owed. He said he would raise the issue in Parliament next week as the issue needed "wider scrutiny".

Q: Does Christine Lagarde think China needs capital controls?
Lagarde replies that it wouldn't be a particularly good idea for Beijing to burn through all its reserves propping up the yuan.
China needs to give clarity, certainty and one message on exactly how the exchange mechanism works, and what the yuan is being measured against.

 Kuroda: China may need capital controls  
 Onto China, which has been eating into its foreign exchange reserves in an attempt to support the yuan. 
Kuroda says that Beijing faces a tough battle, and may need consider new restrictions to prevent money leaving the country.
He says:
China's authorities have been struggling to avoid excessive depreciation or appreciation of its currency while also maintaining an accommodative monetary stance.
My personal view, which may not be shared by the Chinese authorities is that in this somewhat contradictory situation, capital controls could be useful to manage the exchange rate as well as domestic monetary policy in a consistent and appropriate way.

The Bank of Japan is fully committed to achieving the price stability target of 2% and will do whatever it takes to achieve that target, at the earliest stage.
We don't believe there are any limits to our policy tools, he adds.

But we aren't behaving like the greek government. We have taken a much more measured approach, approaching Europe as friends, colleagues and allies.
Osborne says that in "a mature and measured way" we can get that agreement, maybe at the February meeting. 
If it's not a good deal, Britain won't sign.
But given all the challenges in the EU, I think it's in Europe's interests to give us a deal that works for all member states.

 Osborne: there is goodwill for a deal with Europe  
Q: Is there any chance of a deal in the next few weeks that will satisfy the huge eurosceptical forces in the UK?
There will be people who want to leave Europe, come what may, and some who want to stay, George Osborne replies.
But if David Cameron can come back with a creditble reform packate, we can make a case for staying.
There is goodwill out there, we now have to make it happen.
block-time published-time 10.04am GMT 
Britain has three priorities through our EU renegotiation, says Osborne:
We want to create a more competitive European union, to create more jobs and growth
Want to address concerns about migration.
Mainstream governments should not ignore these pressure, but should address the legitimate concerns that can fuel them.
Thirdly, we need a better working relationship between euro and non-euro countries, and the fact that large countries such as the UK will not be in the eurozone.
There is a remorseless logic that the eurozone needs ever-closer union, and Britain does not want to be part of it, Osborne concludes.
block-time published-time 10.00am GMT 
 Now George Osborne speaks, saying his 'clear economic plan' has given the UK a pretty secure footing going forwards. 
But we don't duck big decisions - the Scottish referendum, for example, has "checked a move towards the break-up" of the UK. 
And with the EU referendum, Britain is seeking a more competitive EU.
I have sat on panels for five years, hearing people talk about creating more competition. Now we need to do it, says Osborne.
And he cites an old Chinese proverb: Talk does not cook rice.

 Lagarde: Brexit is a big concern  
 On Europe, Lagarde says the economy is in better shape than a year ago,. 
But the IMF has two big concerns:
One is Brexit, and whether there is a deal between the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe.
We hope very much [there is a deal], as it would really be conducive to more stability and a more cohesive economic zone.
The second is the refugee crisis, which Lagarde calls a 'make-or-break' issue for Europe, Lagarde adds.
If it is well-handled and the integration process is handled well, it will be an upside for the eurozone, boosting growth particularly in Sweden and Germany.
So do you agree that the refugee crisis is 'make or break' for the Schengen area? 
Speaking personally, not as MD as the IMF, Yes, I think so, Lagarde replies.

China's economic rebalancing, as it moves from industry to service, export to domestic market,and investment to consumption.
Commodity prices, where the fall has accelerated in the last 18 months.
Asynchronous monetary policies around the world, creating capital flows as money returns to the US, depreciating the currencies of some emerging markets.
And emerging markets - Lagarde says India and China are performing much better than Brazil or Russia.

 Japan's central bank chief, Haruhiko Kuroda, says he doesn't believe China's economy will crash. 
Markets have been volatile this year, against heightened uncertainty over China's economy and oil prices, he says. But he does not share the pessimistic view about the implications.
China's slowdown is due to the challenge of rebalancing its economy.

Q: Will Britain be in the EU in a year?
Osborne says he is optimistic of getting a good deal for Britain and the European Union.
And he insists that Europe needs to reform itself.
I don't want my continent priced out of the world economy.
And if the British people see we are delivering that change across Europe, they will vote to stay in a reformed EU.

 Osborne: We can get a deal in February  
 Osborne says that Europe likes to cut a deal at the 11th hour, because the Greek banks need to open or a bond needs paying.  
But we aren't behaving like the greek government. We have taken a much more measured approach, approaching Europe as friends, colleagues and allies.
Osborne says that in "a mature and measured way" we can get that agreement, maybe at the February meeting. 
If it's not a good deal, Britain won't sign.
But given all the challenges in the EU, I think it's in Europe's interests to give us a deal that works for all member states.

 Osborne: there is goodwill for a deal with Europe  
Q: Is there any chance of a deal in the next few weeks that will satisfy the huge eurosceptical forces in the UK?
There will be people who want to leave Europe, come what may, and some who want to stay, George Osborne replies.
But if David Cameron can come back with a creditble reform packate, we can make a case for staying.
There is goodwill out there, we now have to make it happen.

Britain has three priorities through our EU renegotiation, says Osborne:
We want to create a more competitive European union, to create more jobs and growth
Want to address concerns about migration.
Mainstream governments should not ignore these pressure, but should address the legitimate concerns that can fuel them.
Thirdly, we need a better working relationship between euro and non-euro countries, and the fact that large countries such as the UK will not be in the eurozone.
There is a remorseless logic that the eurozone needs ever-closer union, and Britain does not want to be part of it, Osborne concludes.

 Now George Osborne speaks, saying his 'clear economic plan' has given the UK a pretty secure footing going forwards. 
But we don't duck big decisions - the Scottish referendum, for example, has "checked a move towards the break-up" of the UK. 
And with the EU referendum, Britain is seeking a more competitive EU.
I have sat on panels for five years, hearing people talk about creating more competition. Now we need to do it, says Osborne.
And he cites an old Chinese proverb: Talk does not cook rice.

 Lagarde: Brexit is a big concern  
 On Europe, Lagarde says the economy is in better shape than a year ago,. 
But the IMF has two big concerns:
One is Brexit, and whether there is a deal between the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe.
We hope very much [there is a deal], as it would really be conducive to more stability and a more cohesive economic zone.
The second is the refugee crisis, which Lagarde calls a 'make-or-break' issue for Europe, Lagarde adds.
If it is well-handled and the integration process is handled well, it will be an upside for the eurozone, boosting growth particularly in Sweden and Germany.
So do you agree that the refugee crisis is 'make or break' for the Schengen area? 
Speaking personally, not as MD as the IMF, Yes, I think so, Lagarde replies.

China's economic rebalancing, as it moves from industry to service, export to domestic market,and investment to consumption.
Commodity prices, where the fall has accelerated in the last 18 months.
Asynchronous monetary policies around the world, creating capital flows as money returns to the US, depreciating the currencies of some emerging markets.

 World and economic leaders hold informal meeting  
 This year, the Guardian's Davos bureau is a prime table at the heart of WEF, just outside the office of founder Klaus Schwab. 
And from there, we've seen a string of senior politicians and top central bankers emerge from a meeting. That includes the IMF's Christine Lagarde, Bank of England governor Mark Carney, Finland's finance minister Alex Stubb, and Axel Weber of UBS.
It's not a crisis meeting, though, but an IGWEL - an informal gathering of world and economic leaders.

 Gideon Rachman, the Financial Times's top foreign affairs writer, reckons that this year's World Economic Forum has been dogged by the "shadow of populism": 
Davos delegates shouldn't be surprised that the public are looking at the state of the world economy, and the political landscape, and decide that a change is needed.
But the sort of populism promoted by Donald Trump is rather alien, and alarming, for those at WEF. 
Gideon writes:
The shadow of Donald Trump has loomed over Davos this year. So has the prospect that refugee flows into Europe will undermine centrist leaders such as Angela Merkel, the German chancellor. More broadly, those at Davos are aware that they increasingly represent the "unpopular" - the business and political elites that are the targets of public anger and disillusionment.
Sooner or later, most corridor conversations in Davos have turned to the US presidential election. It is gradually dawning on people in the Swiss resort that either Mr Trump or Ted Cruz, the Texas senator, will probably win the Republican nomination, and that the "unthinkable" - a Trump or Cruz victory in November's presidential election - could happen.

 Our economics editor Larry Elliott has been coming to Davos for two decades. And he writes that this year's meeting has been particulary dominated downbeat. 
For Justin Welby, mulling over the state of the world in Davos has been easier than the previous week spent trying to hammer out an Anglican church compromise over gay marriage. The Archbishop of Canterbury even cracked one of the better jokes at the World Economic Forum.
Asked whether god is in cyberspace, Welby replied: "I think he must be because every time I am on the underground or a bus I see people looking at their computer or mobile phone saying 'oh god, why won't this work'."
Humour has been in short supply at this year's Davos. The optimism of a year ago that the global economy was on the up after the deep slump of 2008-09 has disappeared fast....

 So, what have we learned from Davos this year? 
In a nutshell, the so-called 'global elite' are worried about a range of problems, and struggling to make much progress in solving them.
There's been no end of talk about refugees, market turmoil, oil, the risk of a new pandemic, and gender inequality. But no real sign that we're close to a breakthrough on any of it.

The twelve, among some 4,500 soldiers brought in to ensure security at the World Economic Forum this week, had been tested after others in their unit raised the alarm.
Using drug-sniffing dogs, military police had also discovered that one of the soldiers had more than three grammes of cocaine in his possession, according to the report.

block-time updated-timeUpdated at 8.53am GMT


January 23, 2016 Saturday 11:00 AM GMT 

Sport in 2016 will illuminate but last year's scandals mean darkness remains; 
The two showpiece events of the year - the European Championship and the Rio Olympics - will captivate but both will proceed with corruption in the air.

Andy Bull.

In newspaper patter, the sports section has always been known as the "toy department". This is because, Peter Wilby argued in the Guardian back in 2006, " sports news meets lower standards than most other news". Wilby said this was because it was written for fans, who only wanted "endless idle gossip about who should be dropped, who should be signed, who will win next Saturday". Fans, he wrote, who "like writers to reflect back the same emotions - anger at defeat, ecstasy after victory - that they feel themselves." If there was once some truth in Wilby's words, it seems things have changed since he wrote them. In 2015 the biggest sports stories were the scandals at Fifa and the IAAF. And so along with the fans' anger and ecstasy, other emotions, indignation, at the shamelessness of the administrators who run the sports, and mistrust, too, of some of the men and women who compete in them. 
And so on to 2016, a year that promises to bring fans more of all four feelings. The big events begin with the Six Nations. Fresh starts for England under Eddie Jones, and, across the channel, France under Guy NovËs. Jones's first test a trip to Edinburgh to play Scotland, the one European team to exceed expectations in the World Cup just gone. Waiting, Wales and Ireland, who have split all the last four titles between them, and are looking to kick on again if they can.
In March, the World T20 in India, the modern home of cricket, with England looking to make amends again for their poor performance in the previous edition. And in April, the Masters, and the first major round in one of the most exciting rivalries in sport, between Rory McIlroy and Jordan Spieth, their year building towards the Ryder Cup at Hazeltine in late September. Before then, Wimbledon, and the annual explosion of excitement over Andy Murray's latest campaign.
 Related:  From the Olympics to Euro 2016: how to attend the top sporting events
Looming over all that, two events. The European Championship in June and July, run by a body whose president is currently suspended from all football-related activities. The tournament is larger and longer than ever now it has been expanded to 24 teams, four home nations among them. On 16 June, England play Wales in Lens, a match that will stop the traffic. And then, in August, the greatest show on earth, the Olympic Games. Its showpiece sport, athletics, in the thick of the worst crisis in its history, and at the same time graced by the biggest sports star on the planet, Usain Bolt. Trying not only to become the first sprinter in history to win a third 100m title, but the first, too, to win a triple-triple of all the sprint events. Bolt will be competing in a stadium, the Est·dio OlÌmpico Jo„o Havelange, named after a man who was forced to resign from the honorary presidency of Fifa because he took kickbacks from a marketing agency.
The Olympics will be beaten in, as it often is, by a steady drum-roll of bad news stories. In March, the World Indoor Athletics Championships take place in Portland, Oregon. Russia, suspended until at least the end of that month, will not be represented. Whether their team make it to the Olympics depends on their ability to prove their athletes are working in a "safe and secure environment". So says the International Association of Athletics Federations president, Seb Coe. "If we don't get the change we want," Coe says, then "the clean athletes are going to have to sit this out."
Some think these are empty threats. Weigh Coe's words against those of the IOC president, Thomas Bach, who says he is confident "Russia will cooperate to make progress and to be sure that Russian athletics are compliant with Wada", and so secure their place at the Games. Dick Pound, the author of Wada's recent report, is certain that Russia will be allowed to compete. "I'd be very surprised if the organisations that have to declare them compliant again would not be cooperative in making that happen."
That, at least, is a problem the IOC can control, unlike some others. Brazil is in recession, its worst in 80 years. The economy contracted by 4.5% over the course of 2015. Right now unemployment is at 8%, its highest level in six years, and inflation is running over 10%. Moody's have cut the country's credit rating down to just above junk status, and recently announced that they are planning to review it over again.
The government is making massive spending cuts, even as it is embroiled in one of the worst political scandals in the country's history. "Operation Car Wash", a police investigation into the state oil firm Petrobras, has led to the arrests of dozens of industrialists, and accusations against at least 50 politicians, mainly from the ruling coalition. President Rousseff is facing impeachment.
Last summer, hundreds of thousands turned out in different cities across Brazil, to march in protest. What appetite, in the thick of all this, for the Olympics? Some test events have already been disrupted by protests, with a road cycling competition being re-routed and rescheduled to avoid a clash with an anti-government protest on Copacabana beach.
Mindful of the public mood, organisers have said that they will slash the operating budget by between 10% and 30%, and that, in the words of their communications director, "the days of lavish spending are over". They say the cuts will be made "behind the scenes", without compromising the Olympic experience for the competitors or spectators. One recent proposal was to make the athletes pay for their own air-conditioning. One thing unlikely to be cut is the security, which will likely ensure that any protests are off-site and out of sight.
Against that backdrop, the Games begin to feel like a big boondoggle. Overpriced and unwanted, struggling to justify their enormous cost. Few cities seem to want to host future Olympics. Toronto decided not to bid for the 2024 Games because there was so little corporate support. Boston and Hamburg dropped out because public opinion was against it. "The people of Hamburg want a city policy that is geared to the basic needs of the population, rather than focusing on global events or flagship projects," explained a spokesperson for the NOlympia movement. A soundbite ever so similar to those given by a spokesperson for the equivalent campaign in Boston. "There are better ways to spend public resources than on a three-week party." At the moment, four cities are still in the running. It was a similar story with the 2022 Winter Olympics, awarded, in the end, to Beijing after Munich, Oslo, Stockholm, Lviv and Krakow all dropped out of the running.
It feels like there is a lot at stake on this Olympics, that they could be a pivotal point in the history of the Games. "Yes," says Bach, "these times are difficult for sport. But yes, it is also an opportunity to renew the trust in this power of sport to change the world for the better."
Perhaps. But at a moment when so many fans are wondering whether they can believe in what they are paying to watch, another year like the last would be more than many can stomach. Spot-fixing, price-gouging, bid-rigging, state-sponsored doping. For all the excitement and ecstasy 2016 will bring, there will be plenty of anger and indignation too. Life in the toy department is beginning to seem a serious business.

Rio 2016: hopes high that Games can reacquaint world with sport's good side; 
With doping and corruption scandals ravaging high-profile sport since London 2012, the stakes are high for the Olympics to create the right kind of headlines.

Owen Gibson.

It was not only the stomachs of the 10,500 Olympic athletes who will head for Brazil in August that lurched as the calendar ticked into 2016. Games organisers, too, will have felt an extra frisson in the knowledge that later this year a big gap will finally be filled by a giant leap into the unknown.
 Related:  2016 Olympics facing deep cuts but organisers insist 'Rio will be magic'
When Rio de Janeiro won the right to host the 2016 Olympics in 2009, one of the factors that swung it their way was a huge map of the world showing where previous Games had been held that contained a massive gap over South America. 
Back then, the pitch of beach volleyball on Copacabana and a giant coming of age party for Brazil as an economic superpower proved a mix even more potent for International Olympic Committee members than the caipirinhas mixed by beach vendors along Ipanema.
Buffeted by the global downturn, things have changed a bit since then and Brazil's economy is suffering a huge hangover - leading organisers to search for cost savings and last-ditch fretting about ticket sales that goes beyond the usual pre-Games nerves. Then there are concerns over the quality of the water in the bay that will host the sailing, the last-minute rush to finish crucial transport links and concerns over the promised legacy for the city.
But as was eventually the case with the football World Cup of 2014, the hope is that the sporting action will combine with a party atmosphere created by the Cariocas to come to the rescue.
Public opinion has not been nearly as hostile to the Olympics as it was to the World Cup, with many buying the argument advanced by Rio's mayor Eduardo Paes (a prototype Boris Johnson hoping to use the Games as the launchpad for a presidential bid) that it will help turbocharge the development of the city's infrastructure.
Whether that argument will hold beyond the Olympics is just one of many imponderables about this Rio Games.
Combined with the unique ability of the Olympics to mix the box office allure of Usain Bolt and Allyson Felix with the stories yet to be written of those who spend four years training in relative anonymity only to explode into the international consciousness at Games-time, the fervent hope is that it will be all right on the night.
From archery in the Sambadrome made famous by the city's annual carnival, to a bold attempt at grouping events aimed at a younger audience in a specific zone to the north of the city, to spectacular backdrops for the marathon and cycling road race, organisers hope the spectacle will burn so brightly as to obscure any lingering doubts.
The addition of golf and, in particular, rugby sevens to the programme will add extra intrigue and colour as the medals start to rain in. No one is more desperate for a great Games than the IOC, which is facing increasingly loud questions from a sceptical public about the benefits of hosting the Olympics in their backyard. For the hundreds of millions watching on television, however, there will be plenty to gorge on.
In the Jo„o Havelange stadium (named after the now-disgraced Fifa president, another reminder that the turbulence gripping world sport has reached new levels since London 2012), athletics will be looking to Rio for some respite from the issues that have gripped it in the past four years. As so often, Bolt will carry the sport on his shoulders. Perhaps more than any other athlete in history, Bolt has displayed an ability to write his own story. Rio will be the third part in a trilogy that began in Beijing and, he has insisted, will be his last. As such, he will be desperate to go out with a triple double of Olympics golds in the 100m and 200m.
Extra spice is likely to be provided by the renewal of his duel with Justin Gatlin, the twice-banned American sprinter whose head to head with Bolt at the Beijing world championships became overtaken by the somewhat overblown "good v evil" narrative attached to it.
Other athletes aiming for an Olympic double on the track will include Felix, who will be able to target both the 200m, in which she will come up against Dutch flying machine Dafne Schippers, and the 400m following a scheduling tweak by organisers. Mo Farah will be another hoping to put a turbulent four years since his career-defining twin Olympic triumph in London behind him.
Another year older since repeating the feat at the world championships in Beijing, but seemingly in no sign of slowing down, Farah will cement his status as the greatest British distance runner of all time if he can again outfox his Kenyan and Ethiopian rivals. In addition to his Super Saturday counterparts Jessica Ennis-Hill, who will go head to head with Katarina Johnson-Thompson in th?e? heptathlon, and Greg Rutherford in the long jump, a cohort of younger British athletes including sprinters Dina Asher-Smith and Zharnel Hughes will seek to announce their arrival on the world stage.
Beyond the individual highlights on the track, the wider tone will also be set by the decision by the IAAF in late March on whether to readmit Russia to the Olympics following revelations of state-sponsored doping.

GB's gold ambitions
If London 2012 was, for a domestic audience at least, bathed in a golden glow that now seems unworldly then those who invest a mixture of exchequer and Lottery funding in Team GB have set their sights higher still for 2016.
Even before the London Olympics finished, the funding body UK Sport had vowed to top Britain's best performance in more than a century by winning "more medals in more sports" and becoming the first host nation to increase their haul at the Games that followed. It is a huge ask and one that must not become a millstone.
In addition to strong performances from the sports that have sustained Britain's leap up the medal table in Beijing and London - cycling, sailing and rowing among them - swimming must bounce back from a disappointing Games in 2012 that yielded just three medals and other sports must step up to the plate if the target of 65 is to be surpassed.
One of those may be gymnastics, after both the British men and women created history at last year's world championships by winning silver and bronze respectively in the team competition. Other sports that can add to that tally include boxing, taekwondo and hockey.
The respected analyst Luciano Barra's latest predictions in December had Britain finishing fifth in the medal table with 52. One of the challenges for Team GB's athletes and those who fund them will be to make sure the nation doesn't forget how far they've travelled since finishing 36th in the medal table in Athens.
If even more so than seven years ago, Rio represents a risk - multiplying the usual last minute concerns about transport networks, infrastructure and ticket sales - it also represents an opportunity. Much is resting on the famed ability of Rio's residents and visitors to create a party atmosphere against the backdrop of the city's natural beauty.
But if the organisers can prove that a pared-down Games can succeed then it might just set a template for others while, as ever, it will be down to the athletes to create the lasting memories that will make or break the Games and cut through the wider cynicism that has pervaded sport in the four years since London. Sometimes a leap into the unknown can also be invigorating and refreshing.

Donatella Versace opens Paris fashion week with sporty couture; 
A collection which taps into 'ath-evening' and shows a designer tapped into reality and current trends.

Imogen Fox Fashion editor.

On Sunday night Donatella Versace, a pocket-rocket of a designer from Milan, opened the haute couture shows in Paris with a collection that was both modern and rooted in reality. Well, at least as much rooted in reality as it is possible to be when talking about evening dresses costing more than £10,000.
Her collection was named "Athletic Couture" and featured dresses with ergonomic lines which traced the models' curves, harness straps and white ski pants and matching zip tops highlighted with orange go-faster stripes all of which could loosely be termed sporty. Before the show the designer said "I was thinking about women at their most focused and dynamic ... women who push themselves to the limit." 
Dreams and magic, rather than focus and dynamism, are the more usual vernacular of couture. But this collection tapped into the modern trend of "ath-evening" - wearing posh tracksuit bottoms with high heels or shoulder baring tops with racer backs which recall performance sportswear, to a swanky evening event. It's a concept which rejects the fusty notion that a gilt edged invitation demands the kneejerk response of a floor length, cocktail dress. That feels a bit too Nancy Reagan-era White House for now. In this context it was refreshing to see a designer using current trends to influence even the highest levels of a brand's design repertoire. It was a move that younger couture customers - looking for something that little bit more relevant - will appreciate. 
So much about the world of haute couture celebrates the past. Dresses as weighed down with an over-reverance to the history of les petits mains and the workmanship of the ateliers as they are with bugle beads and crystals.
Much of the big names on couture schedule are designed by men - the world of couture can feel very backward sometimes.
But Donatella's Versace is different. In couture terms the brand is an ariviste (it rejoined the couture rosta only four years ago). What is more the designer's approach feels modern and open. The Versace family has been no stranger to scandals in the past but Donatella's Versace is one where knowing irony lives happily alongside high glamour and sexually charged designs. Look up her Instagram account if you are unconvinced. 
The designer herself was at pains to highlight Versace's modern point of difference. She noted that "couture is not about the past, it is a living tradition." To emphasis this still further the designer had used silicone gel throughout the collection - a forward-thinking kind of couture decoration which looked as if a spirograph had been involved.
Chunky crystal ropes (which recalled those sugary shoelace sweets) were knotted and threaded in and out of evening gowns. Flashes of highlighter orange and neon yellow - the sort of colours seen on performance trainers - were a motif throughout the show. There was a catsuit with ski-pant stirrups and a white evening gown which looked as if a neon yellow swimsuit was worn underneath. 
Dynamism, strength and athleticism may have been the starting point, but there was plenty of femininity too. Supermodels dressed in cobalt blue and acid tangerine dresses wearing four inch heels can never really be accurately described as looking ready to compete in track and field. The couture levels of craftsmanship and technical accomplishment of the atelier were also keen to be highlighted by the Versace team - journalists were briefed that one crochet dress took a month to complete. 
Summing up the show the designer said: "This collection is one of the most complicated, sophisticated and technically accomplished that we have ever created." Like the eveningwear design her clients will likely lap up, Donatella Versace is not about modesty. Nor should she, or they, be.

Adidas has written to the IAAF to inform athletics' embattled governing body it is terminating its sponsorship deal three years early, according to reports.

The German sportswear company signed an 11-year agreement with the International Association of Athletics Federations in 2008 reported to be worth around £23m. But the BBC reported that the ongoing doping and corruption scandal has prompted Adidas to inform the IAAF that it will be pulling out of the deal. Neither Adidas nor the IAAF has made any comment.
According to the report, the move will result in tens of millions of dollars in lost income. The BBC claims the IAAF was told Adidas was considering ending its relationship with them in November after the publication of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) Independent Commission's first report, which detailed claims of "state sponsored doping" within Russia.

Weiner review: an unsparing portrait of politics and a gift that keeps giving; 
Documentary about former congressman Anthony Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin channels the spirit of the best and most surreal political journalism.

Lanre Bakare.

Star Rating: 5 stars
Joe McGinniss's book The Selling of a President is widely regarded as a peerless look inside the inner workings of a presidential campaign. It paints a warts-and-all picture of the neurotic, unhinged politician - one Richard Nixon - that the world came to know in greater depth after the scandal that ended his career. It was also a cautionary tale for any politician who ever thought about giving a journalist almost unlimited access to their campaign. 
That warning went unheard by the group running Anthony Weiner's disastrous mayoral bid in 2014, and documentary fans should rejoice for it. The resulting film is a riveting excursion into fear and loathing on the campaign trail. The film caused a stir before it's premiere because of the access the team got to not only Weiner but also his wife, Huma Abedin, who is Hillary Clinton's top aide.  
The couple's relationship dominates much of the action. Their marriage was already strained following Weiner's  2011 resignation from the US House of Representatives, following leaks to the press that he sent sexts to several women. (It's tested after Weiner again succumbs to temptation and sends more explicit pictures.) The film puts their relationship under an unflinching microscope. We see them in their kitchen, feeding their child and having increasingly tense conversations.
The documentary team of Josh Kreigman and Elyse Steinberg do more than focus on the pics, though. Weiner is presented as a passionate career politician, a leader who took on the Republicans who tried to block healthcare assistance for 9/11 first responders. He's clearly a gifted orator who knows what makes people tick - but just can't seem to stop himself from ruining the hard work he's done to rebuild his reputation. 
After the second scandal, when MSNBC journalist Lawrence O'Donnell asks Weiner "What is wrong with you," it's hard to not empathise with his frustration. Unlike Alex Giney's Lance Armstrong documentary, which charted the cyclist's fall, it's hard to feel complete contempt for this politician. It feels more like a political tragedy that a comedy writer like Armando Ianucci would construct, especially when one aide screams about implementing the "McDonald's plan" - a plot to sneak Weiner into his own celebration party via fast food restaurant, because one of the people he sexted is waiting for him outside. 
Eventually, the film becomes about Weiner's enthusiasm and apparent inability to understand when he should back down. He soldiers on, regardless of the pain he inflicts on his family and closest aides. His energy leads him to surreal ends: Colombian and Israeli celebrations, even finding himself MC on a Caribbean parade float.
It's that total access which makes the documentary a compelling, deep dive into a scandal that so many, especially the New York Post and Stephen Colbert, had painted as the simple - and crude - case of one prurient politician. Weiner is abused in the street, his marriage "to an Arab" raised in an ugly altercation - yet even in these brutal scenes he rarely asks for the cameras to leave. 
The only time he shows frustration with the film-makers is when he asks whether flies on the wall should be able to ask questions. That inability to stop himself in front of a camera is his biggest asset and biggest flaw. For Steinberg and Kreigman it's the gift that keeps on giving.

'Cheap' Google deal sets bad precedent, says tax expert; 
Richard Murphy worries that HMRC is set to repeat tax settlement with other multinationals.

Sarah Butler and Jennifer Rankin in Brussels.

The UK risks undermining an international clampdown on tax avoidance if it signs more deals like the agreement with Google to recover £130m in back taxes, a tax expert has warned.
HM Revenue & Customs is thought to be close to striking deals on back taxes with the likes of Facebook and Amazon, which generate large revenues in the UK but have paid little corporation tax historically.

Multinationals are under pressure to reach agreement with the UK tax authority before the diverted profits tax is brought in on 1 April, which will levy a 25% tax on profits that are deemed to have been artificially moved outside the UK.
                     Chancellor George Osborne celebrated the deal with Google, under which the online search firm agreed to pay £130m on top of the £70m it has paid on profits in the UK since 2005, as a "really positive step". 
Under a deal which will keep it clear of the diverted profits tax, Google has agreed to pay tax on an element of future revenues from UK advertisers as well as on profits. However, the company will be able to keep taxes low by continuing to book advertising deals with UK clients through its international headquarters in Ireland.
Tax expert Richard Murphy, who was a prominent backer of Jeremy Corbyn's leadership campaign, estimates that Google should be paying £200m a year in corporation tax, based on the firm's declared profit margins and sales 2014 sales in Britain of £4.5bn.
"I can't understand why the deal with Google is so cheap. I'm worried if they are going to repeat that with other companies. What was agreed is far removed from what is required for sustainable corporation tax in future," Murphy said. "They are undermining the new international tax consensus which David Cameron and George Osborne have worked for, supposedly."
He said the Google agreement was not in line with proposed rules backed by the Organisation for Economic Development (OECD) and supported by Osborne, which link taxes to revenues earned in a particular country.
At present, many multinationals avoid local taxes by using a complex network of companies to shift profits elsewhere.
Murphy said: "It's one thing offering deals for the past and a different thing to offer deals for the future when we've had the OECD give a stronger basis for taxation which considers a company as a UK resident." 
The HMRC said it would not comment on the tax affairs of particular businesses.
However, a spokesperson for HMRC said: "We intensively manage the tax risks posed by multinationals. At any given time approx two thirds of large businesses are under enquiry."
The UK body is working with five other tax authorities to share information about how digital multinationals might be shifting their profits to tax havens under the E6 project.
Shadow chancellor John McDonnell is set to demand details of Google's deal from Osborne in parliament on Monday. He described the online search firm's payment as "derisory" and argued the public would be sceptical about what he warned looked like a "sweetheart deal". 
Prof Prem Sikka, a tax avoidance expert at the University of Essex who is undertaking a review of HMRC for Labour, said the deal with Google "raised more questions than answers". He said the company had effectively paid an annual rate of corporation tax of just 2.77% over the last decade. British businesses currently pay coporation tax of 20% of their profits.
Meanwhile, EU authorities are aiming to shut down 'brass plate' companies in Europe, the practice where multinational corporations create a letter-box subsidiary in one country to cut their tax bill in another.
The proposal is part of sweeping reforms from the European commission to close the main tax loopholes and end sweetheart deals that have helped multinational companies avoid billions in corporation tax.
Officials think the measures to be announced on Thursday spell the end of "brass plate" companies in Europe - letter-box subsidiaries that do little genuine business, but help a firm lower its tax bill. In 2014, tax campaigners found one address in Luxembourg that was home to more than 1,600 companies.
The commission is also seeking to close the most commonly used tax loopholes, including the practice of setting up a subsidiary in a non-European tax haven, as well as taking advantage of tax relief in two countries, known as "double non-taxation". 
The proposals represent the EU's attempts to get to grips with multinational tax avoidance, following the Luxleaks scandal and growing evidence that hundreds of companies, from Apple to Starbucks, have taken aggressive action to cut their tax bill. 
Under the commission's plan, multinational companies would be obliged to report profits to local tax authorities, if they are generated in that country. This is an attempt to clamp down on tax-avoidance on highly profitable businesses - a practice that shot to notoriety when it emerged that Starbucks had paid £8.6m in taxes on a reported £3bn in UK sales over 14 years in the UK. 
"Tax planning has become more elaborate in recent years," says a draft copy of the commission proposals seen by the Guardian. "Now more than ever, co-operation between member states' tax authorities is crucial in order to tackle tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning."

Diversity on television is not just a black and white issue; 
Idris Elba's address to MPs last week was so good because the actor made a claim not just for black men but for people of all colours and shapes.

Jane Martinson.

It's not funny any more. Even though UK viewers are likely to see more sexist behaviour per hour of primetime comedy than in any other genre of television, the lack of diversity on and behind our screens is a little less than LOL.
The fact that men outnumber women two to one on television, that women disappear almost completely after the age of 50, that there are hardly any disabled presenters on air of any age, or that black men are only listened to about the industry's lack of diversity once they've become really famous in America; none of it is all that funny. 
Nor is the fact that Idris Elba decided to move to America only when he realised he wasn't being sent parts calling for people with "twinkly eyes". Instead, as he told a roomful of MPs and journalists in Westminster last week, he was always asked to audition for "athletic types" or just "black males". And that was just on Crimewatch, he joked, never for the leading man.
Actors moaning about racism and women about sexism - none of it is new. After a campaign led by Sir Lenny Henry, the BBC pledged to increase the number of black, Asian and minority ethnic people on air by more than 40% as long ago as June 2014, as well as to almost double the number of senior managers from those groups who work at the corporation by 2020.
But more than a year on, a joint industry campaign, Project Diamond - launched in November 2015 to monitor diversity across the BBC, Channel 4, ITV and Sky - is still not quite off the ground. Channel 4, which is proving its public service credentials by leading the way on diversity issues, hopes it will be up and running by the summer.
On the same day that Elba gave broadcasting inequality the star factor in London, Jada Pinkett Smith joined others such as David Oyelowo and Spike Lee in pledging support for a boycott of the Oscars this year over the failure to nominate a single black actor for the second year running. There also wasn't a single female director nominated.
Criticism over a lack of diversity tends to reach a fever pitch during awards season - only when recipients gather together to collect gongs does their physical similarity to each other really stand out, it seems. It isn't just in the film and television industries that white men dominate, of course. In last year's British press awards, women once again reached equality in numbers only in the categories for newcomer or interviews.
But by the time people are winning awards - ok, with the exception of the newcomer categories - it's already a bit late.
Elba's speech was so good because he made a claim not just for black men but for people of all colours and shapes. He also highlighted the tendency for one class to dominate the media. What he said is worth repeating: "Diversity in the modern world is more than just skin colour. It's gender, age, disability, sexual orientation, social background, and - most important of all, as far as I'm concerned - diversity of thought."
He may have provided the Richard Littlejohn wishlist from hell - you know the one, about the one-legged black lesbian in a hijab favoured by the politically correct - but as a Hollywood A-lister, the joke's no longer on him.
Elba, whose Sierra Leonean dad worked in a Dagenham car factory while his Ghanaian mum worked in an office, pointed out that while talent was evenly distributed, opportunity was not. He went on to thank Prince Charles for giving him his start as an actor, as a £1,500 grant from the Prince's Trust allowed him to audition for the National Youth Music Theatre.
There are signs of change, albeit slow and pretty inadequate, such as a forthcoming BBC1 drama with two black actors in the leading roles. What's more, Sophie Okonedo plays a senior lawyer while Adrian Lester is an ex-police officer. Undercover sounds brilliant but one programme does not a revolution make.
The signs of change when it comes to social mobility are even weaker. The media remains dominated by the privately educated, 43% of national newspaper columnists and 26% of BBC's most senior managers, according to the Social Mobility and Child Poverty commission report in 2014, compared with just 7% of the country as a whole.
Student tuition fees and the collapse in paid entry-level reporting jobs in local newspapers mean that those with access to the bank of mum and dad are even more likely to predominate in the media.
Yet the world is changing. The leaked draft report by Dame Janet Smith into the Jimmy Savile scandal last week served to remind us that the television sexism and racism of the 1970s and 80s are no longer acceptable.
Women have long made up 50% of the population, but 40% of Londoners are now from an ethnic minority, and other minorities - whether disabled, transgender or just other - are making their voices heard. And where better to get your voice heard than in the media?

G4S paid to look after empty beds at scandal-hit Medway youth jail; 
Just 47 children now held in unit at centre of abuse allegations but security firm that runs it still charges for full capacity of 76.

Eric Allison and Simon Hattenstone.

The security firm G4S is being paid for looking after empty beds in a secure training centre (STC)  that is the focus of allegations of widespread abuse by staff, the Guardian has learned. The company has received over £260,000 since the abuse story broke. 
The shadow home secretary, Andy Burnham, said G4S was running rings round the government and the public was losing confidence in its cosy relationship with the firm.  
                     The Youth Justice Board (YJB), which oversees the detention of young people in England and Wales, told the Guardian that 47 children are detained at Medway STC in Kent. But G4S is being paid to look after the full capacity of 76. Following the allegations, the YJB announced it would stop sending children to Medway.
Earlier this month, a Panorama investigation revealed footage, taken by an undercover reporter working as a guard at Medway, in which  children were being assaulted by staff, who later boasted about the abuse to colleagues. 
Staff were also seen talking freely about falsifying records of violent incidents. Under STC rules, if more than two children are fighting, it is classified as staff losing control of the centre and G4S faces heavy fines. Footage showed a guard saying: "If we get an incident with four kids, it will get split up so they, G4S, don't get fined."
The allegations of abuse, now under investigation by police, include children being hit on the head and being restrained against STC rules. One child said he could not breathe as a guard was pressing on his windpipe. 
G4S, the world's biggest security firm, has a troubled history of running STCs. In 2004, 15-year-old Gareth Myatt died after being restrained by three adult guards at Rainsbrook STC, operated by the company. Before he died, he told guards he could not breathe.
G4S runs England's three STCs - Medway, Oakhill in Milton Keynes and Rainsbrook in Northamptonshire. But following a damning inspection report last year, the contract to run Rainsbrook was taken away, although the company is in place until May when MTCnovo will take over. The inspection at Rainsbrook found children had been subjected to degrading treatment and racist comments from staff. Six members of staff were dismissed.
In 2014, following a Guardian investigation, 14 children who had been unlawfully restrained in STCs run by G4S and Serco were awarded damages amounting to £100,000. Neither company admitted liability but paid two-thirds of the damages. The remaining third was paid by the YJB.

Last November, the charities Article 39, the Howard League for Penal Reform and Inquest, wrote to Tom McNally, chairman of the YJB, asking if provisions had been made in the five-year contract for G4S to run Rainsbrook should it be found that children had not been properly cared for there. In reply, Lin Hinnigan, YJB chief executive, said: "The contract can be terminated if performance levels reach certain trigger points, if there is a breach of contract which adversely affects the provision of custodial services, or if the contractor fails to submit or complete rectification plans."
Carolyne Willow, director of children's rights charity Article 39, said: "If the allegations of assault and child cruelty and falsifying records at Medway turn out to be true, surely there would be no question about breaches of contract? Otherwise, the care and safety of children has not been written into the contract, which would be an extraordinary failing." 
G4S charges the government £138,051 per child per year at Medway. In the 24 days since the YJB stopped sending children there, the company will receive £263,242.25 for the 29 empty beds.
Following the allegations, G4S said it had suspended or sacked seven members of staff at Medway. The Guardian has learned that figure has risen to 11 and G4S is seeking that number of replacement staff.

Burnham said: "G4Ss are clearly running rings round this government and have got them wrapped around their little finger. Whatever happens, G4S can't lose. Even when it is alleged they have been responsible for appalling breaches of contract they still come up trumps, and make even more money.
"The public is losing patience with this government's cosy relationship with this company. G4S can't get paid for people they are not looking after, especially when there is evidence that their officers abused children in the first place. G4S should return any money immediately and there needs to be a wider review of the nature of all the contracts the government holds with G4S."
A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: "As per the contract agreement with G4S for the running of Medway Secure Training Centre, the company is paid based on the availability of places and not the number of people at the establishment at any given time. This is a standard form of agreement that is in place for many establishments that are operated by external companies on behalf of the MoJ.
 "We have also established a review of the youth justice system, led by Charlie Taylor. He will report back later this year with recommendations on how to improve the treatment of young people in our care."

Japan's decade-long wait for sumo champion comes to an end; 
Kotoshogiku, 31, claims Emperor's Cup in what may mark beginning of challenge to years of domination by Mongolian fighters.

Justin McCurry in Tokyo.

Japan's agonising wait for a homegrown sumo champion has ended after Kotoshogiku on Sunday became the first Japan -born wrestler in a decade to win a tournament.  
The 31-year-old claimed the Emperor's Cup and sparked wild celebrations inside the arena after throwing his opponent, Goeido, to the ground to end the New Year tournament in Tokyo with an unassailable 14 wins and one loss.
His victory could mark the beginning of a challenge to years of domination by Mongolian wrestlers, and reignite interest in the ancient sport among younger Japanese people.
The overseas sumo onslaught began with  Konishiki and other Hawaiian wrestlers in the 1990s, and continued into the next decade with the arrival of the Mongolian wrestler Asashoryu, whose brilliance in the ring was sometimes tarnished by bad behaviour off it.
Until Sunday, no Japan-born wrestler had won a tournament since Tochiazuma exactly a decade ago, and the sport has not had a Japanese grand champion, or yokozuna, since Takanohana retired in 2003.
Kotoshogiku broke into a beaming smile as the scale of his accomplishment sank in. His parents, who were in the crowd, burst into tears, and relatives and friends watching on a big screen in his hometown of Yanagawa, in south-western Japan, erupted in celebration.
"It's hard to find the words to describe how I feel," said Kotoshogiku, who stands 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighs 180 kilos (28st 4oz).
"I am so delighted ... I thought about the tough times when I struggled [with injury] and my record was poor, but I have come this far with the support of so many people and the guidance of my stable master."
Traditionalists will hope that Kotoshogiku's victory marks the beginning of a new era for sumo, whose reputation has been hit in recent years by a series of scandals, including allegations of bout fixing, gambling and drug taking.
Perhaps the most damaging incident occurred in 2007, when a 17-year-old recruit died following an assault by three senior wrestlers on the orders of their stable master.
It remains to be seen whether Kotoshogiku, who holds the rank of champion or ozeki, can end the domination of the three reigning grand champions, all of whom are Mongolian.
Hakuho, considered by many to be the greatest sumo wrestler of all time, has notched up a record 35 tournament victories since May 2006, while his fellow Mongolian, Harumafuji, has seven tournament wins. 
Kotoshogiku, who performs a crowd-pleasing backward stretch before each bout, beat all three yokozuna in Tokyo, losing just once to his childhood friend Toyonoshima.
Toyonoshima, who at one point was a contender for the title, embraced his rival after his victory. "His win meant this was both the saddest and happiest day for me," he said. "I'm just looking forward to the next time we are both in contention."
Three professional tournaments are held in Tokyo during the year, while Osaka, Nagoya and Fukuoka host one each.

And he only charged 20 francs. Quite a bargain, and proof that the world isn't all bad.

 Osborne: We've got to help China  
 We know that George Osborne is a big China fan. And he concluded the session on the Global Economic Outlook by urging global leaders to support Beijing. 
"The world has not been very good over previous centuries at accommodating rising powers," the chancellor warned.
"It is massively in our interests that we bring China into the multilateral institutions of the world.....and make it feel part of the global system."<end>
China really has dominated this year's World Economic Forum (along with the refugee crisis). Osborne's words may fall flat, though, if policymakers fumble the move to a more domestic-driven, consumer based economy. Especially if the credit bubble that has swelled over recent years bursts badly.

The subject of capital controls is very sensitive for the IMF because late last year it recommended the renminbi be admitted into the fund's elite basket of currencies, including the US dollar, euro, yen and sterling, on the grounds that it was now "widely used" and "freely usable". Capital controls would undermine both conditions.

George Osborne's comments won't spare Google from a grilling in parliament over the tax deal.
There is plenty of concern that £130m in back taxes is a rather meagre sum, for a company of Google's size and importance.
And the Public Accounts Committee is determined to dig into it.
Meg Hillier MP, chair of the PAC, said overnight that she was "shocked" by the workaround methods used by multinationals. It doesn't reflect well on the tax officials, either: 
"HMRC now needs to assure taxpayers that it will keep up the pressure to tackle whatever the next emerging issue is in real time, rather than years later.
"It is effectively admitting it pulled in too little tax from Google for nine out of ten years.
"This is not a great success rate and the Public Accounts Committee will be calling in HMRC and Google to explain.

 George Osborne has told the Guardian that the £130m tax deal announced with Google overnight is a "huge step forward" 
Speaking to my colleagues Larry and Jill just after his panel debate in Davos, the chancellor said he regarded it as a major success for the government.
He told us:
This is a major success of our tax policy.
We've got Google to pay taxes and I think that is a huge step forward and addresses that perfectly legitimate public anger that large corporations have not been paying tax. I think it's a really positive step.
I hope to see more firms follow suit and of course I've introduced a diverted profits tax which will require this going forward. So I think it's a big step forward and a victory for the government".
Overnight, the search giant announced that it will pay £130m to the UK - a decade's worth of tax. It will also pay more taxes in the UK in future, as part of a shake-up of the way the multinational pays tax.
Osborne's comments at Davos come after Labour shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, criticised the deal.
My colleague Kevin Rawlinson reports:
People will be "sceptical" about what he said looked like a "sweetheart deal", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday, adding that HMRC seemed to have settled for a "relatively trivial amount of money."
McDonnell will be asking HMRC to publish full details of what it believed Google owed. He said he would raise the issue in Parliament next week as the issue needed "wider scrutiny".

Q: Does Christine Lagarde think China needs capital controls?
Lagarde replies that it wouldn't be a particularly good idea for Beijing to burn through all its reserves propping up the yuan.
China needs to give clarity, certainty and one message on exactly how the exchange mechanism works, and what the yuan is being measured against.

 Kuroda: China may need capital controls  
 Onto China, which has been eating into its foreign exchange reserves in an attempt to support the yuan. 
Kuroda says that Beijing faces a tough battle, and may need consider new restrictions to prevent money leaving the country.
He says:
China's authorities have been struggling to avoid excessive depreciation or appreciation of its currency while also maintaining an accommodative monetary stance.
My personal view, which may not be shared by the Chinese authorities is that in this somewhat contradictory situation, capital controls could be useful to manage the exchange rate as well as domestic monetary policy in a consistent and appropriate way.

Osborne says that in "a mature and measured way" we can get that agreement, maybe at the February meeting.

Britain has three priorities through our EU renegotiation, says Osborne:
We want to create a more competitive European union, to create more jobs and growth
Want to address concerns about migration.
Mainstream governments should not ignore these pressure, but should address the legitimate concerns that can fuel them.
Thirdly, we need a better working relationship between euro and non-euro countries, and the fact that large countries such as the UK will not be in the eurozone.
There is a remorseless logic that the eurozone needs ever-closer union, and Britain does not want to be part of it, Osborne concludes.

If it is well-handled and the integration process is handled well, it will be an upside for the eurozone, boosting growth particularly in Sweden and Germany.

 Gideon Rachman, the Financial Times's top foreign affairs writer, reckons that this year's World Economic Forum has been dogged by the "shadow of populism": 
Davos delegates shouldn't be surprised that the public are looking at the state of the world economy, and the political landscape, and decide that a change is needed.
But the sort of populism promoted by Donald Trump is rather alien, and alarming, for those at WEF. 
Gideon writes:
The shadow of Donald Trump has loomed over Davos this year. So has the prospect that refugee flows into Europe will undermine centrist leaders such as Angela Merkel, the German chancellor. More broadly, those at Davos are aware that they increasingly represent the "unpopular" - the business and political elites that are the targets of public anger and disillusionment.
Sooner or later, most corridor conversations in Davos have turned to the US presidential election. It is gradually dawning on people in the Swiss resort that either Mr Trump or Ted Cruz, the Texas senator, will probably win the Republican nomination, and that the "unthinkable" - a Trump or Cruz victory in November's presidential election - could happen.

David Morrison, former chief of army, named Australian of the Year; 
Now-retired general, whose scathing address to serving ADF members went viral, honoured for his commitment to gender equality, diversity and inclusion.

Helen Davidson.

Lieutenant General David Morrison, the former chief of army for the Australian Defence Force and equality campaigner, is the 2016 Australian of the Year.
 Related:  'No one loves the army more than me,' says outgoing chief David Morrison
The winner was announced by Malcolm Turnbull at a ceremony and concert in Canberra on Monday evening.  
Morrison was chosen for his commitment to gender equality, diversity and inclusion, the awards organisation said.
The profile of the now-retired general rose in 2013 after his video address to serving ADF members in the wake of the so-called "Skype scandal", in which he lambasted members who turned a blind eye to sexism, harassment and abuse of women in the force.
"On all operations, female officers and soldiers have proven themselves worthy of the best traditions of the Australian army," he said. "They are vital to us maintaining our capability now and into the future. If that does not suit you, then get out." 
On the eve of his retirement in May, Morrison told Guardian Australia that in many eyes his career would be defined by the three-minute YouTube clip. 
"Well, so be it," he said. "If that is how I'm defined then that is no bad thing. If it has helped people then I am really, really delighted. But it never set out to do that.
"It's only a fellow, a bloke, saying to his workforce that treating your colleagues with respect is a precondition of your employment. That's all it is."
The clip was viewed more than 1.5m times and led to Morrison being invited to speak at an international conference on eliminating sexual violence in conflict zones.
Morrison, a self-described feminist, joined the army at the age of 22. In his four years leading it, he also pushed for an increase in the proportion of women in the ranks. Of the three arms of the ADF the army has the lowest proportion of women, at 12%. 
Prof Gordian Fulde was awarded Senior Australian of the Year for his work as the director of emergency at St Vincent's hospital and Sydney hospital for more than 30 years.
For the first time the Young Australian of the Year award has been given to two people. Nic Marchesi and Lucas Patchett, both 21 and from Queensland, launched their mobile laundry service to assist homeless people in 2014 and it has now grown to five locations.
Catherine Keenan, a former journalist and editor from New South Wales, was named Local Hero for 2016, for her work as a youth educator and as the co-founder and executive director of the Sydney Story Factory. The organisation offers free writing workshops to young people, focusing on marginalised and disadvantaged kids.
The chairman of the National Australia Day Council, Ben Roberts-Smith VC, MG, congratulated the winners.
"David, Gordian, Nic and Luke, and Catherine are Australians who truly inspire us and make us proud - they are people who step up, speak out and take action to make a difference in our nation and to help others," he said.
The outgoing Australian of the Year, Rosie Batty said in her valedictory speech that the year had often been overwhelming as she campaigned against family violence while grieving the death of her son, Luke. 
"As I juggled grief and loss, suppressing my sadness whilst enjoying the most amazing opportunities of my life, along my journey I became mindful that I was becoming some sort of public figure, perhaps even a tragic type of celebrity, and that I was still fragile and vulnerable," she said.
Batty said she had felt pressure to enact change within her year in the role, and would continue to work with the Never Alone campaign. "The conversation has not only started, it is now well under way. Family violence is still epidemic and it will be for some time."
The Labor senator Nova Peris was among those to congratulate and thank Batty for her work.
 Related:  Rosie Batty: I was reeling with raw grief while Australian of the year
"Rosie has helped shine a light on one of the great social challenges of our time, family violence," she said. "She has worked tirelessly to raise awareness of this issue and it's become a priority for many more Australians." 
In 2015 Batty travelled to the Northern Territory to highlight the disproportionate rate of violence among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. 
"I commend Rosie Batty on her great work and commitment," Peris said. "I wish her luck in continuing her advocacy going forward. Thank you, Rosie Batty."
The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said Batty was an "unlikely hero of our times".
"Rosie's grace and courage has forced us all to look beyond the silence and ambivalence that has shrouded family violence for too long," he said.
"She has inspired change, forced action and moved this country all closer to stamping out the shame of family violence. As nation, we owe Rosie more than our humble thanks. We must continue to act."

Adidas exit from IAAF is linked to bottom line more than morality; 
It is unlikely Adidas has suddenly discovered a conscience and the reality is even more troubling for IAAF president Sebastian Coe and a sport enveloped in crises.

Owen Gibson.

To anyone with more than a passing knowledge of the fascinating, twisted history of Adidas the idea that it has suddenly discovered its moral compass and taken a stand against the fetid corruption and institutionalised doping in athletics is laughable.
This, after all, is the same company that has supplied the ball at every World Cup since 1974 and extended its sponsorship deal with Fifa to 2030 even as corruption allegations brought  world football's discredited governing body to its knees. 
It is the company that was notably more muted and measured in its language in calling for reform at Fifa HQ, when fellow sponsors belatedly found their voice, and then stayed silent when they called for Sepp Blatter to quit immediately last year.
And, more crucially, it was absolutely key in the collision between money, marketing, broadcasting and sport that gave birth to the circus surrounding modern football and the Olympics, and indirectly to the dark heart of bribery and backhanders that infected both.
What began as a rivalry with Puma (the other German giant formed as the result of a schism between the original Dassler brothers) at each successive Olympics to ensure their spikes were on the feet of medallists became, under Horst Dassler, a vast web of marketing and licensing deals.
Horst Dassler also founded ISL, the sports rights company that was later implicated in a $100m bribery scandal that involved a whole generation of Fifa executives.
It was also intimately involved with the advent of the TOP programme that ushered in the existing model where a handful of brands pay hundreds of millions of pounds for exclusive marketing rights to the five-ringed circus.
It started bringing in the big bucks during an era when athletics, the blue-riband sport of the Games, was mired in allegations of state-sponsored doping and covered-up tests. Sound familiar?
In Pitch Invasion, Barbara Smit's set text on the company's rivalry with Puma, there is a small photograph of Horst's funeral in 1987.
Behind the coffin walk Jo„o Havelange (the now-disgraced Fifa president who minted the laissez-faire division between personal and private income that characterised the modern Fifa), a youthful Sepp Blatter (his protege and successor) and Juan Antonio Samaranch (the Franco sympathiser who did the same job for the IOC).
All this ancient history is important because it highlights the extent to which Adidas, even more so than Puma and Nike, became entwined with the behemoths that Fifa and the Olympic movement became as the money tap was turned on. Thomas Bach, the current IOC president, is a former Adidas executive.
So, if it is unlikely that Adidas has suddenly discovered a conscience, then the reality is likely to be even more troubling for the IAAF president, Sebastian Coe, and a sport enveloped in endless crises.
More likely is the fact that business considerations make its decision to terminate its lucrative sponsorship dea l an expedient course of action at this stage. The German sportswear giant appears to be undergoing a period of retrenchment as it focuses on its core markets (football in particular) and looks to shed marginal endorsements to service its record-breaking £750m Manchester United deal.
As with many things in modern sport, marketing may also be at the heart of this decision. By highlighting its anti-doping credentials and loosening its ties with athletics Adidas flags up a point of difference with Nike - its bitter US rival that has been under pressure over its backing for the twice-banned bogeyman Justin Gatlin  and strenuously denied allegations swirling around Alberto Salazar and his Project Oregon training programme. Not to mention the fact its swoosh is to be found on the vests of Russia's tainted athletes. Coe, of course, reluctantly gave up his ambassadorial role with the company before Christmas.
But the fact that this may be a hard-headed business decision rather than a moral one in some ways makes it more remarkable for, if the Adidas lawyers get their way, it will mark a rupture in another longstanding alliance.
The IAAF's marketing partner Dentsu, handed a long-term contract to 2029 by Coe's predecessor, Lamine Diack (now under arrest for allegedly accepting more than (EURO)1m to cover up doping violations, which he denies), was a partner with Adidas in ISL. It was the Japanese marketing giant to which Horst Dassler turned when he was getting ISL off the ground.
And it was under the structure of Dentsu's deal with the IAAF that Papa Massata Diack, Lamine's son, acted as a marketing consultant with carte blanche to search for marketing deals in emerging markets. According to the second part of Dick Pound's Wada report it now seems increasingly clear that this was being used as cover for all sorts of underhand activity.
Amid this tangled web the impact of the Adidas decision on the IAAF's bottom line will in fact be minimal. The main part of the deal is believed to be worth around £5m a year but that money has already been pledged to the IAAF as part of that (undisclosed) Dentsu deal.
Far more damaging is the latest blow to the reputation of the sport. For even if this is a cynical and opportunistic move rather than a moral and upstanding one, it highlights just how far athletics has fallen - and how much further it still could plummet.


January 25, 2016 Monday 8:52 PM GMT 

IAAF sponsors standing by athletics' governing body despite Adidas pullout; 
∑ IAAF refuses to comment on reports its biggest sponsor has ended deal early ∑ Bans given to four more Russians highlight deep problems remaining.

Sean Ingle.

The IAAF's remaining sponsors are so far standing by athletics' beleaguered governing body in the wake of Adidas terminating its lucrative deal four years early - but the deep problems in the sport were again highlighted on Monday when four more Russians were banned for drugs offences. 
The International Association of Athletics Federations refused to comment directly on reports that Adidas, its biggest sponsor, had pulled out of a contract reportedly worth about £5.6m a year. An IAAF spokesman said it was now in "close contact with all sponsors and partners as we embark on our reform process".
 Related:  Russian Olympic Committee announces doping bans for four athletes
The IAAF has received the backing of Canon, who said it would stick with its sponsorship, which runs out at the end of this year. "We have no intention to terminate the contract before that date," it added. The IAAF's other official partners - Toyota, Seiko, TDK, TBS and Mondo - are yet to comment publicly, although Toyota said it may issue a statement later on Tuesday.
The BBC, which broke the story on Sunday night, said the early end to the Adidas deal would mean the lost revenue for the IAAF and its commercial partner, Dentsu, over the next four years would be more than £21m. The IAAF insisted, however, that track and field remained a valuable property for advertisers.
In a statement, Dentsu's executive officer, Kiyoshi Nakamura, said: "We have full confidence in the new leadership of the IAAF and the reform process, and the IAAF World Athletics Series remains an important property within Dentsu's global sports business portfolio."
Nike are yet to comment on speculation they would be willing to take over Adidas's role. Such a decision would certainly be controversial, given that the IAAF president, Sebastian Coe, received a six-figure sum from the American sportswear firm until recently.
The damaging fallout from the Russian doping and corruption scandal continued when four athletes, including the 2012 European 800m silver medallist Irina Maracheva, were banned.
Maracheva, who was given a two-year suspension, had initially finished in bronze place behind her Russian team-mate Yelena Arzhakova and Britain's Lynsey Sharp in 2012 but was upgraded to silver when Arzhakova was stripped of her title after abnormalities were found in her biological passport.
Sharp, who was upgraded to gold in 2013 and received the medal in 2014, responded by tweeting a picture of her holding her medal. "Remember that time I was the only clean athlete on the podium?" she said, adding: "At least it's only taken a full Olympic cycle for Maracheva to get banned." Maracheva's coach, Zamira Zaitseva, claims the athlete's abnormal blood readings were because of a childhood car accident that had "changed her blood parameters".
The race walker Anna Lukyanova, a silver medallist at the 2010 World Junior Championships, has also been given a two-year ban, while there are four-year suspensions for the runners Maria Nikolaeva and Yelena Nikulina.
According to the Russian news agency Tass, the decision to ban the four athletes was taken by the interim co-ordinating committee of the Russian Olympic committee because the All-Russia Athletic Federation has been suspended by the IAAF.
An IAAF inspection team are in Moscow to meet Russia's new athletics chief, Dmitry Shlyakhtin.

"A lot of the work that we do lives in the shadows. There's a silence that often surrounds it - but sometimes that silence is at the request of people working with victims of family violence and discrimination."
Broderick singled out the 2015 Australian of the year, Rosie Batty, for her work on domestic violence.

"Rosie Batty - someone with such a persuasive and influential voice - has really showed us this year that when we take these issues out of the shadows so much change can happen," she says.
Broderick, who encouraged Australians to nominate more women for honours in 2016, believes the nation has experienced a real shift on gender equality, "the pointy end of which is violence against women".
"We've started to say: 'That's not who we are, that's not part of the values we have here in Australia'."
 Asked about recent high-profile scandals involving harassment, Broderick says: "I expect we'll continue to see more public scrutiny [in 2016], that people will call out sexism whenever they see it, that there'll be greater education around respectful relationship."
Change is coming, Broderick says, "from the classroom to the boardroom".

Tesco to be censured by supermarket watchdog over conduct with suppliers; 
Groceries Code Adjudicator to report on investigation into allegations that company broke code of practice on treatment of suppliers.

Graham Ruddick.

Tesco is to be reprimanded by the supermarket watchdog over its treatment of suppliers, dealing another blow to the reputation of Britain's biggest retailer.
The Groceries Code Adjudicator (GCA) will deliver a slap on the wrist to Tesco on Tuesday as it reveals the findings of a year-long investigation into allegations the company breached the industry code of practice by delaying payments to suppliers and demanding extra fees.
The GCA probe is not directly connected to the Serious Fraud Office investigation into a £326m accounting scandal at Tesco, but will shine an unflattering light on how the company treated its suppliers. 
City analysts have warned that Tesco could face a £500m fine for the accounting scandal, with the SFO in the closing stages of its investigation.
The GCA, led by Christine Tacon, has the power to name and shame companies and issue public recommendations. However, it will not be able to fine Tesco because the grocer allegedly committed the offences before the government handed the GCA the power to fine a company up to 1% of its annual revenue last year.
The GCA's investigation into Tesco is the first since it was launched a 2013 and is a substantial test for the credibility of the organisation. 
                     Tacon announced the probe last year. She said the GCA would look at allegations that Tesco delayed payments to suppliers and demanded payments from businesses for more prominent positioning of their products within stores. 
Tesco has already admitted there are likely to have been instances where it breached the Groceries Supply Code of Practice.
In the small print of its latest annual report, the company said: "Regrettably, we have concluded that there have been a number of instances of probable breaches of the code which fall short of the high standards we expect to uphold in our dealings with our suppliers."
The GCA launched the investigation after it was presented with information from suppliers and Tesco itself on the back of the discovery of a black hole in the company's accounts.
Dave Lewis, Tesco's chief executive, revealed in September 2014 that a shortfall had been found in the retailer's accounts relating to payments from suppliers. Tesco was accused of bringing forward payments to flatter its financial results. The company suspended nine executives, with chairman Sir Richard Broadbent leaving in the aftermath of the scandal.
Mike Dennis, analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said the SFO investigation into the scandal could lead to Tesco paying out more than £350m in fines and repaying hundreds of millions of pounds to suppliers for "arbitrary unjustified cash payments" it demanded from them.
Dennis said the scope of the alleged fraud at Tesco might be far greater than has been revealed so far. He estimated that the amount Tesco collected from supplier payments rose by £1.7bn over five years to £2.4bn in February 2014 and accounted for 30% of cash profits.
"To secure a case against Tesco, the SFO needs to link the commercial income fraud to a controlling board director and senior management by mens rea, where 'the acts and state of mind' of those who represent the 'directing mind and will' of the company can be attributed to the employees' behaviour and fraud, in our view," Dennis said.
"We believe Tesco could be fined 1% or more of its UK grocery sales, or £350m on £35bn of sales. In addition, there might be individual prosecutions after applying the identification principle to controlling officers of the company. The SFO could also add punitive fines to deter other grocery retailers and force repayments which together could cost Tesco £500m."
                     Tesco, the SFO, and the GCA declined to comment. Shares in the company fell almost 3% on Monday.

Wristbands and red doors for refugees: history is not repeating itself, but it is rhyming; 
In the week we remember the Holocaust, it would be a disservice to the millions who died if we didn't recognise that the treatment of Muslim migrants is an echo of the past.

Giles Fraser.

The Big Short, the film version of Michael Lewis's book about the 2007-08 financial crisis, focuses on a few people who saw what was coming. As the rest of Wall Street continued to trade complicated bundles of mortgages - loans that, at bottom, no one had the money to pay for - some traders quietly built up negative positions and made a mint when the whole rotten scheme was exposed as a scam. As the film nears its end, and the reality of sub-prime mortgages is beginning to emerge, the hedge fund manager Mark Baum, played by Steve Carrell, sits alone in the park and makes another gloomy prediction: "I have a feeling in a few years people are going to be doing what they always do when the economy tanks. They will be blaming immigrants and poor people."
He was right about the sub-prime mortgages. And he was right about blaming immigrants and poor people. That's what happened after Europe was swept up in the 1929 Wall Street crash. Before that, Adolf Hitler was little more than a small-time thug. By 1933 he was the German chancellor. 
According to words often attributed to Mark Twain, "History doesn't repeat itself, but it rhymes." Red doors for refugees in Middlesbrough, now smeared with excrement and racist graffiti. Next red bracelets in Cardiff (a policy that has subsequently been dropped). This is not the same as the yellow stars Jews were made to wear in the lead-up to the Holocaust - not least because the yellow star, unlike the red wristband, was worn under penalty of death. Even so, it rhymes.
Elsewhere in Europe, the Germans, Danes and Swiss have started confiscating the valuables of refugees as they enter the country. The Danes have justified this to pay for special camps for refugees. Again, not the same as the 1930s. But it rhymes. A French cartoon asks about the boy who drowned off the Turkish coast: "What would Alan have become if he'd grown up? An ass groper in Germany?" It's not the Nazi cartoons in Der Sturmer. But still.
Last week a pig's head, inscribed with a swastika and the words "Fuck Allah", was tied to the gates of an Islamic school in Portsmouth. Something similar happened at a Blackburn school in December. No, it's not the same. But again, it should ring a bell.
This week we remember the Holocaust, the most patently evil act of the 20th century. Lest we forget, indeed. Yet we do the memories of those millions of murdered people a disservice if the only thing we do is to remember backwards, locking their deaths into some receding past from which no lessons can emerge. We must also remember forward, looking to the present for signs of the past, being constantly vigilant against the possibility that such suffering, or anything resembling it, might ever happen again. And I emphasise "anything resembling it" because there is an argument that the Holocaust was unique and that any comparison to other events, even rhyming comparisons, posits a moral equivalency that downplays the horror of the death camps; that such comparisons "plunder the moral capital" of the Jewish people, as the historian Edward Alexander has put it.
Clearly, these are dangerous waters. And it is easy to see how one can get muscled off the ball when suggesting rhyming comparisons to the Nazi persecution of the Jews. But this itself is a problem - because even if nothing like it had happened before, that does not mean that nothing like it could happen again. A part of the proper role of historical memory is to make us alert to the rhymes and rhythms of history. That's also the problem with Godwin's law - that anyone who mentions the Nazis on the internet immediately loses the argument. It restricts the application of memory.
 Related:  Rats: the history of an incendiary cartoon trope
Take the comparison between Islamophobia and antisemitism. The writer Yasmin Alibhai-Brown was widely condemned for suggesting that "today the new Jews of Europe are Muslims". There are many differences between the two, people pointed out, often angrily. Jews do not murder innocent people on the streets of western Europe. Indeed, radical political Islam is currently the most vigorous propagator of contemporary antisemitism. And Alibhai-Brown's comment suggests that antisemitism is a thing of the past, which it most certainly isn't. But none of this should stop us hearing the echoes of the past in the way many Muslim migrants are now being treated.
What is remarkable about the scandal of asylum seekers in Cardiff being allocated wristbands is what lots of people are thinking, but very few are saying: it reminds us of the lead-up to the Holocaust. And we don't say it because we fear being branded hysterical. But this is why questions are being asked about red wristbands in parliament today. And why it's a news story at all - because it reminds us of the 1930s - and further back.
In 1215 Pope Innocent III ruled that "Jews and Saracens of both sexes in every Christian province and at all times shall be marked off in the eyes of the public from other peoples through the character of their dress". It's not the same as red wristbands and doors. But it rhymes.

Cecil Parkinson: PM leads tributes to 'towering Conservative'; 
David Cameron and senior conservatives express admiration for former colleague who was close ally of Margaret Thatcher.

Rowena Mason Political correspondent.

David Cameron has led tributes to Cecil Parkinson, as his first big political boss and a towering figure in the Conservative party. 
The prime minister posted a series of tweets about Parkinson as senior Conservatives rushed to express their admiration for their former colleague, who was one of Margaret Thatcher's closest political allies. 
George Osborne also worked with him when he was party chairman in 1997 and praised him for being "there in our hour of greatest need". 
Several senior Conservatives recalled Parkinson's close working relationship with Thatcher, and his integral role in her 1983 election victory.
Alan Duncan, who was Conservative vice-chairman under Parkinson's second chairmanship, said: "He started as Margaret Thatcher's great marketing man for overseas trade and turned into one of the great personalities of the Thatcher era. He was a central part of her main team. He was personable, amusing, easygoing and mischievously witty and a great member of the parliamentary skiing team."
 Related:  Lord Parkinson obituary
Others suggested he could have succeeded Thatcher as prime minister were it not for the scandal of his affair with his former secretary who gave birth to his child.
Sir Malcolm Rifkind, a former foreign secretary, told the BBC: "Cecil Parkinson would have been the most natural candidate to succeed Margaret Thatcher because she would have had tremendous confidence in him as someone who shared her basic theme. In her words he was 'one of us'. He shared her views, her thoughts, her ideas. They came from the same position on the political spectrum and therefore she was comfortable with him and had confidence in him. In addition to that, at a personal level he was able to charm her. He was a very good-looking, very handsome man. She was attracted by men who were good looking but also had strong principles and strong views."
Michael Portillo, another former cabinet minister, said Parkinson had been a "very helpful right-hand man" to Thatcher and a "very well-organised" party chairman. "He was very much of [Thatcher's] mind. He had an easygoing charm and charisma," he told the BBC. "He was a very attractive man, and she liked to have around her manly men, and he absolutely suited what she was looking for in that early 1980s period when the Conservative party was seen as rather tough, rather austere, rather aloof. He brought something else to it."
William Hague, the former foreign secretary and party leader who brought Parkinson back as party chairman in 1997, said: "He was a very popular figure in the party. He did me a great favour. He was an unusually nice man for a politician. He had no previous intention of coming back into politics but when I asked him to come back as party chairman to help me see the party through a very difficult time, he thought about it for 24 hours, consulted his wife, but then he did it and he did a great job. I've never forgotten that."

Homan Square: US inquiry into Chicago police 'should also cover facility'; 
Justice Department pressured to expand civil rights investigation as Rahm Emanuel's challenger calls secret detention warehouse's inclusion 'crucial'.

Zach Stafford in Chicago.

A major investigation into Chicago police should be extended to cover the detention warehouse Homan Square, a police interrogation facility exposed by the Guardian, a group of politicians have said. 
The Cook County board of commissioners, which oversees the second largest county in the US including the entirety of Chicago, approved a measure on Wednesday calling for the DoJ to expand its landmark investigation into the city's police department "to look into allegations of civil and human rights violations" at Homan Square.
That inquiry from the nation's top law enforcement agency came after video footage of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald being shot in the back by a Chicago police officer led to the forced resignation of the city's police chief, and a wider look by the justice department's civil-rights division which has only put more pressure on Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel to step down after police misconduct on his watch.

"In order to begin to restore faith in our criminal justice system, it is crucial that the DoJ investigate these allegations and include Homan Square in its pattern and practices investigation," said Jesus "Chuy" Garcia, the county commissioner who nearly defeated Emanuel in a runoff election last year that turned on police reforms Barack Obama's former chief-of-staff has encouraged only since protests in late November over McDonald's death.
As Chicago's police take the national spotlight from Cleveland and Ferguson, Missouri, which were subject to similar DoJ inquiries into race-based policing and use of force, Cook County officials said the scale of Washington's investigation "provides us with an ideal opportunity" to bring to light more of the city's law-enforcement abuses.
"Any federal investigation of the Chicago police department that does not include Homan Square will be incomplete and woefully inadequate," said commissioner Richard J Boykin .
At Boykin's latest of several hearings on the warehouse, an activist and two attorneys who have worked with suspects detained for prolonged periods at Homan Square argued that the city's notoriously brutal police force had become too protected by city hall for such allegations to be held up to official scrutiny from within the city.
"The only means by which we can establish concrete facts and hold responsible parties to account is by impartial review," said activist Jonathan Terrasi, "because reporting has shown that misconduct from CPD officers and units working out of Homan Square is both a pattern and a practice."
The board's resolution, which cites "allegations of torture, denial of counsel and off-the-books detentions [that] raise serious questions of human and constitutional rights violations", is non-binding. But the last-minute support from multiple politicians - including Garcia, who told the Guardian he found such allegations "disturbing" - is significant from the county commissioners who have longed proved a thorn in Emanuel's side.
Calls for the justice department to investigate Homan Square independently began almost immediately after the Guardian last year published the first in a series of investigative reports, which include more than 20 first-hand accounts of detention at the facility - as well as documents recording more than 7,000 people held without access to an attorney.
Commissioner Boykin and US representative Danny Davis hand-delivered to the attorney general a request for the Department of Justice to investigate Homan Square in March. On the same day US attorney general Loretta Lynch announced her inquiry into the entire department nearly nine months later - after a judge ordered the unsealing of the McDonald footage, and Emanuel had fired police commissioner Garry McCarthy - she called the Homan Square allegations "extremely important". 
While the facility was not included in the DoJ's initial investigation, "we always reserve the right to expand it", said Lynch.
A spokeswoman for the Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether the agency had yet to receive the resolution or reconsidered the scope of its inquiry. 
But activists, continuing to protest about Homan Square amid their calls for Emanuel to resign, are hoping for more than extra oversight by the US government: they want the warehouse shut down.
"We have been consistently campaigning for the closing of Homan Square ever since we found out about it," Frank Chapman, field organizer of Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression's Stop Police Crimes project, said after McCarthy's firing. "We wouldn't have found out about it if it wasn't for the Guardian because no Chicago newspaper whispered a word about it."
Charlene Carruthers, an organizer with the activist group Black Youth Project 100, said she believed the Guardian's reporting on Homan Square had directly resulted in the police chief's resignation but, with a series of policing scandals swarming Chicago, that the mayor should be next.
"They lead a city where it's very clear the police yield abusive power over people, and they're complicit in it," Carruthers said of the Emanuel administration last month. "It includes Laquan McDonald, and it goes far, far, far beyond what happened to Laquan."

Lord Parkinson obituary; 
Conservative politician who took his place at the forefront of 1980s Thatcherism in several ministerial posts, notably at the Department of Trade and Industry.

Stephen Bates.

Cecil Parkinson, who has died aged 84 after suffering from cancer, rose from humble origins to become an archetypal figure of 1980s Conservatism, with a string of ministerial appointments in government. These culminated in his becoming trade secretary at the start of Margaret Thatcher 's triumphalist second administration, following her landslide, post-Falklands general election victory in 1983. He was a smooth, sleekly coiffured minister for whom the highest reaches of government were predicted, but he was brought low within months by the public exposure of a long-running affair with his parliamentary secretary Sara Keays, who was pregnant with his child.
His was only the first of a string of ministerial scandals of the period, often centring on marital infidelity in a government only too prepared to lecture the public about morality and propriety and sometimes to attempt to legislate for it as well. Parkinson's downfall followed what was to become a regular pattern too: newspaper exposure, attempted cover-up, denial, desperate attempts to hang on, followed inevitably by enforced resignation. 
Parkinson proved to be more fortunate than some of his successors, however, as his parliamentary career survived and he later became a minister and chairman of the Conservative party once more. But his reputation never really recovered and a distinct aura of caddishness remained, especially when it became known that he had never seen the child and had made strenuous efforts to prevent his neglect becoming public knowledge.
Although more snobbish Tories of the old school tended to deride men like Parkinson as part of the garagiste tendency - socially inferior, with a background in trade and the lower orders rather than the public schools and the professions - it would be fairer to see them as upwardly mobile beneficiaries of the 1944 Education Act, enabled to transcend social barriers and make money to underwrite their political careers through lucrative new occupations.
In Parkinson's case, he was the son of a railway worker, Sidney Parkinson, in Carnforth, north Lancashire, where the railway scenes of Brief Encounter were filmed. He was educated at Lancaster Royal grammar school, before gaining a place at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, initially to study English under FR Leavis - a slightly mind-boggling conjunction - before switching to study law. In those days he was a Labour supporter and perhaps more interested in athletics than politics; he ran for the university at 200 and 400 yards.
Leaving with a third-class degree, he qualified as an accountant and embarked on the task of securing his future prosperity, buying a specialist engineering firm. In 1957 he married Ann (nee Jarvis), whom he could never quite bring himself to leave during his affair with Keays, and she subsequently stood by him when his philandering was exposed. They had three daughters, Mary, Emma and Joanna.
By 1970 he was trying for parliament. He was initially unsuccessful at Northampton in the June general election that brought Ted Heath to power, but entered the Commons a few months later at a by- election in Enfield West, following the sudden death of the chancellor, Iain Macleod. Parkinson's parliamentary career would be in a series of seats around the north London suburbs in Hertfordshire.
Suave and good-looking in a way that was appealing to some selection committees: slicked hair, chiselled features; smooth in manner and reasonable in tone, with no hint of chippiness, Parkinson made his way through the ranks in a series of strategically useful positions. He was parliamentary private secretary to Michael Heseltine at the Trade department during the Heath administration, then a whip in opposition, then an opposition spokesman on trade, going back to the department when Thatcher came to power in 1979.
He was one of her most assiduous courtiers. In a sign of her favour towards the sort of handsome, self-made men she much admired, Parkinson embarked on a rapid rise in the following four years: paymaster general, chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and at the same time Conservative party chairman. As such, he helped mastermind the 1983 landslide - though given the previous year's Falklands victory and the state of the Labour party at the time, perhaps this was not very difficult - and was duly rewarded by being made trade secretary following the election.
He was already being spoken of as a possible chancellor or even party leader when, within four months, during that year's triumphant party conference in Blackpool, the revelations about Keays emerged. Keays had been Parkinson's secretary for much of the previous 12 years and his longstanding mistress as well. According to her understandably embittered subsequent account, he had promised to divorce his wife and marry her on several occasions and had enticed her back after she secured a job working at the European commission in Brussels.
Harbouring political ambitions herself, she had made it to the party's candidates' list, but their discreet relationship was derailed when she became pregnant. She broke the news to him at her London flat during the election campaign and was appalled by his response that she must have an abortion, or she would destroy his career: "I was shattered by his reaction... but I had not expected this... He said that I had better understand that he would never marry me and that if I had the baby, he would never have anything to do with me again and never wanted to see the child," she wrote two years later in A Question of Judgement (1985).
Parkinson admitted his affair to the prime minister - who was usually more indulgent of the peccadilloes of her colleagues, particularly those she liked, than of the public at large - and to close colleagues. They gave him their support when the story emerged in Private Eye, just as the party's annual conference convened, with MPs, ministers and journalists unusually accessible to each other in the bars and corridors of the Imperial hotel, Blackpool, which allowed for the undignified spectacle of Parkinson being pursued up the stairs to his room, followed by a raucous crowd (of which I was a member) shouting questions at his retreating back.
Despite a disreputable Tory attempt to smear Keays as a promiscuous golddigger, the outcome was inevitable and Parkinson had to resign from the party chairmanship and ministerial office and return unwillingly and with little grace to the backbenches. He did indeed make grudging financial provision for Keays, who retreated to the West Country, to raise their daughter, Flora, born the following January, single-handedly. Parkinson never spoke to Keays again, nor saw the child, nor registered his paternity by expressing any interest in her life whatsoever.
Indeed he successfully sought an injunction to prevent her being identified in any way in the media, unable even to appear in school photographs, a precaution that he claimed was to protect her, but which many saw as little better than an attempt to limit the damage to himself and curtail the public's memory of the affair.
When it became known - once the injunction was lifted on the child's 18th birthday - that Flora had emotional and learning difficulties and had been ill for much of her childhood, Parkinson's reputation suffered further damage. In the words of the commentator George Hill: "The fondness of one woman, the prime minister, and the enduring fury of another, his one-time mistress Sara Keays, so dominate public and political perceptions of Cecil Parkinson that he seems to exist only as a reflection of other people's ambitions and emotions."
After four years as a backbencher, Parkinson was regarded as sufficiently rehabilitated by Thatcher and the chief whip John Wakeham to return to office as energy secretary, following the 1987 election, and then to be transferred to the Department of Transport two years later, both jobs regarded as of lesser importance than his previous portfolio. He resigned ministerial office in 1990 when Thatcher herself resigned, perhaps acknowledging that his time had passed.
Within two years he had gone to the House of Lords with a life peerage and published an autobiography, Right at the Centre (1992). There was one final service to the party, in the wake of the Tories' 1997 electoral defeat, when he returned to his old post as party chairman for a year to steady the dispirited ship: it was during this period that the party instituted the reform of electing its future leaders by a vote of the membership rather than MPs, a move that ensured the debacle of first Iain Duncan Smith 's and then Michael Howard 's periods in charge. Parkinson retired from the Lords in September last year.
It is difficult to assess his achievements as a minister, partly because his career was truncated, but also because he left no significant legislative mark or achievement. Colleagues regarded him as likable, but a ditherer and probably over-promoted by Thatcher. He was, however, smooth and good on television and with party activists: approachable and unstuffy. He remained trim - perhaps attributable to the golf club memberships he held alongside those of his London clubs.
He is survived by Ann, and by his daughters.

Can we stop pretending billionaire Michael Bloomberg - who is reportedly exploring an independent presidential run - has a chance to win any national election, let alone this one? He is the perfect storm of everything that voters find repugnant.

For progressives and the large swaths of the public who are sick of the very wealthiest concentrating their power, he is a plutocrat; the ultimate creature of Wall Street,  who relentlessly defended and befriended the largest and wildly unpopular major banks after they tore down the economy, and resisted any effort to tax the wealthiest 1%.
To Republicans - from whom he would have to steal large chunks of votes to win - his stances on gun control and social issues are far too liberal garner any support among the conservative rank and file beyond those who work at Goldman Sachs. He is radioactive to supporters of both parties.
 Yet here he is again.

Nobody could accuse Erika Andiola or CÈsar Vargas of joining Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign because they fantasized about working in the West Wing. As "Dreamers", young immigrants protected by presidential action, his Latino outreach directors keenly feel the limits that bound their ambitions.
Not only will the young Mexicans be barred from voting for the Vermont senator as he campaigns for the Democratic nomination this spring, they will also be blocked from the polls in November, after devoting more than a year of their lives to the election. And should Sanders win the nomination and the presidency, they will also be prohibited from following him into the White House.

"Only US citizens get to work at the White House," Vargas said ruefully, speaking in the bustling Sanders headquarters in Burlington, Vermont. "But that's what this campaign is all about for us - we cannot vote, but we do have a voice." 
Three hundred miles away in downtown Brooklyn, a similar dynamic is playing out in Hillary Clinton's headquarters. Clinton's core team may be approximately 10 times bigger than Sanders' 30 people - she has about 300 packed into the entire floor of an office block - but here too a "Dreamer" can be found at the pulsing heart of the operation.
Her name is Lorella Praeli, and she leads the team seeking to move the massive Hispanic electorate to help put Clinton in the White House. Unlike her counterparts in the Sanders camp, she could taste life in the West Wing should her boss win.

Joe McGinniss's book The Selling of a President is widely regarded as a peerless look inside the inner workings of a presidential campaign. It paints a warts-and-all picture of the neurotic, unhinged politician - one Richard Nixon - that the world came to know in greater depth after the scandal that ended his career. It was also a cautionary tale for any politician who ever thought about giving a journalist almost unlimited access to their campaign. 
That warning went unheard by the group running Anthony Weiner's disastrous mayoral bid in 2014, and documentary fans should rejoice for it.  The resulting film is a riveting excursion into fear and loathing on the campaign trail. The film caused a stir before its premiere because of the access the team got to not only Weiner but also his wife, Huma Abedin, who is Hillary Clinton's top aide. 
    The comeback that wasn't. Photograph: Kathy Willens/AP   
The couple's relationship dominates much of the action. Their marriage was already strained following Weiner's  2011 resignation from the US House of Representatives, following leaks to the press that he sent sexts to several women. (It's tested after Weiner again succumbs to temptation and sends more explicit pictures.) The film puts their relationship under an unflinching microscope. We see them in their kitchen, feeding their child and having increasingly tense conversations.
The documentary team of Josh Kreigman and Elyse Steinberg do more than focus on the pics, though. Weiner is presented as a passionate career politician, a leader who took on the Republicans who tried to block healthcare assistance for 9/11 first responders. He's clearly a gifted orator who knows what makes people tick - but just can't seem to stop himself from ruining the hard work he's done to rebuild his reputation.

The other day in Manhattan, Hillary Clinton supporters met for lunch at the home of the media executive Geraldine Laybourne. A group of 50, mostly women, was determined to generate excitement for Clinton's campaign for president. They were frustrated to see her lagging again among younger voters, and their invited speaker was Kenyatta Cheese, a young Obama campaign veteran and internet impresario.
The debate sparring that night between Clinton and Bernie Sanders over who belongs to the establishment was another reflection of how perilous it is to be an insider this American political season. And it is galling for politically seasoned women to watch Sanders caricature Clinton as an establishmentarian worshipping at the altar of Goldman Sachs.

Sanders put Hillary Clinton on notice last summer, when no one was paying him much heed. "All over this country," he declared, "ordinary people, working people, elderly people are moving in our direction because they do want a candidate to take on the establishment."
During that most recent Democratic debate in South Carolina, I read texts about Clinton by some students at Harvard, where I teach, and talked to some afterwards. Although Clinton's difficulties with young voters have been much written about, their comments revealed a more acute ennui.
"Hillary, can you excite us?" asks Osaremen Okolo, a 21-year-old African-American who supports Clinton but "misses feeling fired up" as she was for Barack Obama and as some of her friends feel about Sanders.
"Young people like Bernie because he sounds like a revolutionary," she says. But Okolo prefers Clinton's experience and positions on issues like equal pay for equal work and criminal justice reform. "Hillary sounds pragmatic, which can come across as stuffy to young people. Her experience can almost count against her." She adds: "Sanders seems bold, even if none of his ideas can happen."

It is an unlikely-looking spot from which to plot a revolution. The third-floor suite in Burlington that serves as the national headquarters for Bernie Sanders' insurgent presidential campaign in fact looks more like a small-town law office: surprisingly busy for a Friday evening, perhaps, but hardly the den of communist sympathisers some Democratic opponents claim it to be.
In contrast to his frontline base in a faded mall in Iowa, from where Sanders is threatening to upstage Hillary Clinton in next week's Democratic caucus, the prosperous streets here in Vermont's biggest city are buzzing with, well, capitalism - a legacy, say locals, of regeneration during the senator's tenure as mayor in the 1980s.
...Instead, the mood inside the Sanders headquarters as they prepare for the biggest week of their political careers is a very Vermont mixture of surprise and quiet satisfaction....

 David Axelrod, the engineer and adviser behind Barack Obama's two presidential victories, is beating himself up for having made fun, early on, of the Trump presidential candidacy. 
Axelrod should have seen the Trump's appeal, he writes in the New York Times, because Trump's candidacy has strong parallels with Obama in 2008 :
Here's the gist. Open-seat presidential elections are shaped by perceptions of the style and personality of the outgoing incumbent. Voters rarely seek the replica of what they have. They almost always seek the remedy, the candidate who has the personal qualities the public finds lacking in the departing executive.
 Is Trump the next Obama?  Seems kind of like a triple bank shot of political analysis. But proof of Axelrod's political chops sits in the White House.

Time to  take out the trash  round up the latest unsettling scenes from the Donald Trump campaign choo-choo.
On Sunday, a Sikh man who had the guts to stand up at a Trump rally and unfurl a sign reading "Stop Hate" got the full Trump treatment. The crowd, which appears transplanted from a Manila cockfight, jeers and gestures from the bleachers as the man is led out. 
Then Trump piles on, focusing on the man's religious garb. "Naw, he wasn't wearing one of those hats, was he?" Trump says, adding somewhat incoherently:
And he never will! And he never will. And that's OK. But we've got to do something, because it's not working.

You've lived long enough to watch your crowning achievement of bringing democracy to Iraq be destroyed by a Democratic president who withdrew American troops just as things there were shaping up. You've done the Errol Morris documentary. You've published a memoir. 
What's left to do? Solitaire app, of course.  
Donald Rumsfeld, t he two-time US secretary of defence who presided over the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan,  has released a video game, Alex Hern writes: 
The game, initially released as an iOS app, is based on a version of solitaire favoured by Winston Churchill. The variant uses two decks of cards rather than one, 10 rows of cards instead of seven, and an extra pile of six cards called "the Devil's Six" for the player to work into their strategy.

 Obama plays down Sanders, pumps up Clinton  
This Monday morning has delivered a true politics must-read in the form of Politico's Glenn Thrush's interview with Barack Obama. 
Obama says Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has 'luxury'  of being long shot : 
Bernie came in with the luxury of being a complete long shot and just letting loose," he said. "I think Hillary came in with the both privilege - and burden - of being perceived as the frontrunner... You're always looking at the bright, shiny object that people haven't seen before - that's a disadvantage to her."

Obama compares Clinton in 2008 to Ginger Rogers : 'backwards in heels': 
She had to do everything that I had to do, except, like Ginger Rogers, backwards in heels," he said. "She had to wake up earlier than I did because she had to get her hair done. She had to, you know, handle all the expectations that were placed on her."
Obama says Clinton started off 'rusty' :
She is better in "small groups" than big ones, he remarked, and he agreed that her first campaign appearances showed her to be "rusty" - comparing them to his God-awful first debate of the 2012 campaign. "[S]he's extraordinarily experienced - and, you know, wicked smart and knows every policy inside and out - [and] sometimes [that] could make her more cautious, and her campaign more prose than poetry," he told me.

Hello and welcome to our live-wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House. One Week Till Iowa.  Is the Republican party about to nominate Donald Trump for president ? These races can see lots of movement right at the end as voters start to focus on the race and the field winnows. So let's check on the polls in the Hawkeye State GOOD GOD.
Trump's up another five points in polling averages in Iowa on the strength of back-to-back CNN and Fox News surveys showing him leading Texas senator Ted Cruz by 11 points. Trump gained 15 points on Cruz in the Fox poll after Cruz started attacking Trump earlier this month, the Washington Post points out.
For an extra boost, a Trump Iowa rally at the weekend featured the very senior Republican senator from the state, Chuck Grassley. It wasn't an endorsement, mind you. But here's a snapshot: the establishment and The Donald.

We'll know more soon! Here's what else is happening on this Monday morning in politics, and some of what you may have missed over the weekend.
 Obama pseudo-endorses Clinton 
In an interview with Politico, Barack Obama "couldn't hide his obvious affection for [Hillary] Clinton or his implicit feeling that she, not [Bernie] Sanders, best understands the unpalatably pragmatic demands of a presidency he likens to the world's most challenging walk-and-chew-gum exercise," Glenn Thrush writes. 
[The] one thing everybody understands is that this job right here, you don't have the luxury of just focusing on one thing," Obama said.
There's a lot more in the interview and we'll take a closer look later.

Juventus bringing the best out of Paulo Dybala to help fill boots of Tevez; 
Juventus remain two points behind Napoli at the top of Serie A, but in Dybala they have found their answer to the league leaders' Gonzalo HiguaÌn.

Paolo Bandini.

Even Paulo Dybala thought his talent had been overhyped at first. He was only 20 years old in 2014, with a handful of Serie A goals to his name, when his then employer, the Palermo owner Maurizio Zamparini, declared him to be worth (EURO)42m. "That sum is a lie," said Dybala when the figure was put to him during an interview. "Not many players are worth that much and I am certainly not among them."
Juventus plainly felt otherwise. Seven months later, they agreed to sign him for an initial fee of (EURO)32m, supplemented by a further (EURO)8m in potential bonuses. It was the most that the Bianconeri had spent on any player since the Calciopoli scandal, and surpassed in the club's history only by the sums splashed out on Gigi Buffon, Lilian Thuram and Pavel Nedved.
All this for a man who had scored just 21 times in three league seasons at Palermo, including five strikes in Serie B. The 2014-15 campaign had been Dybala's best yet, his 13 goals propelling the Sicilians to 11th on their return to the top flight, but even here his production had been inconsistent. After a purple patch either side of the winter break, he had found the net once in the final three months of the season. 
The scale of Juve's investment came to look even more perplexing once the season had begun. Manager Massimiliano Allegri seemed reluctant to use Dybala, leaving him out of his starting XI for the Super Cup against Lazio, and then again for what became a disastrous defeat to Udinese on Serie A's opening weekend. The Argentinian started the next two matches, but then was back on the bench for fixtures against Manchester City and Frosinone.
Many interpreted Allegri's selections as a lack of faith. Zamparini accused the manager of "ruining a champion", insisting that if Roberto Mancini were in charge at Juventus then Dybala would be playing every week. Allegri quickly became bristly in his dealings with the media. "It's not my fault if the club paid (EURO)40m," he said at one late-October press conference. "I'm just the coach."
Phrases such as that did nothing to dispel the doubts of those who believed Juventus had overpaid. And yet, when Dybala did play, he thrived. He scored off the bench in the Super Cup, and then again in each of his first two league starts. He marked his third, away to Napoli, with an assist instead. 
Allegri was not blind to these contributions. In reality, he was only trying to manage a young talent responsibly - bringing Dybala along slowly just as he had ¡lvaro Morata the season before. Perhaps he was too cautious, or perhaps he got it just right. All we can say for sure is that when Allegri finally did begin to unleash Dybala fully, the player gave him no cause for regrets.
Heading into the Turin derby on 31 October, Juventus sat joint-11th in the table. A 2-1 victory that day became a springboard, launching them into a 10-game winning run that raised them all the way up to second place in time for their game against Roma on Sunday night.
No individual contributed more to this turnaround than Dybala. Involved in every match throughout the winning streak, he started all but one of them and grabbed eight goals along the way. His strikes helped to sink Milan, Fiorentina and Lazio, as well as a tricky Empoli side on the road. When he was not scoring himself, Dybala was helping his team-mates to do so, adding five assists in the same stretch.
How Roma must have wished for a similarly decisive player. Top of the table when Juventus began this run of victories, the Giallorossi had slipped to fifth in part because they lacked a consistent goalscorer leading the line. Edin Dzeko, signed to address that precise need in the summer, had not scored from open play since doing so in the 2-1 win over these same opponents back in August.
Little wonder Luciano Spalletti should seek to park the bus against Juventus. Lined up in an unadventurous 3-4-1-2, with Daniele De Rossi slotting into the centre of defence, Roma left the ball to their opponents and focused on making sure that their opponents had few openings to exploit.
Spalletti has rarely got his tactics right against Juventus in the past. In 18 previous Serie A matches against the Old Lady, his teams had taken a grand total of three points. This time, though, his plan seemed to be working. Not until the 69th minute was Roma goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny seriously tested, blocking Patrice Evra's firmly struck shot at the near post.
But just when the match seemed to be drifting towards an inevitable draw, Dybala rewrote the narrative. Receiving a pass from Sami Khedira just inside the Roma half, Dybala sent it straight back while spinning away from his marker.
Khedira's next touch looked less like an intended pass than a clumsy failure to bring the ball under control, but one way or another it ran through to Paul Pogba. He fed a well-judged through-ball into the box for Dybala, who nudged the ball left and then fired back across his body, finding the far corner of the net.
It was not a flashy finish, but it was an exceptionally ruthless one - its execution so startlingly fast that the keeper had no chance to set his feet in anticipation. In a match played at a low tempo, Dybala appeared in that instant to be moving at a different frame-rate.
Roma had no response, beyond a Miralem Pjanic free-kick that was deflected away over the bar. Dybala's goal sealed Juventus's 11th consecutive league win. One more would equal the club record set by Antonio Conte in 2013.

Juventus remain two points behind Napoli at the top of Serie A, but in Dybala they have found their answer to the league leaders' Gonzalo HiguaÌn. The Juventus player might not score quite so often but, with 12 assists and seven goals, he has had a direct hand in half of his team's goals this season.
His performances were even more eye-catching than his statistics. Billed as a striker on his arrival, Dybala is showing himself to be something more nuanced and sophisticated - a player who loves to drop deep to gather possession and help construct attacks as well as finish them.
He is not quite a No10, and not a false nine either, but instead bears comparison in his approach to the man who came before him at Juventus, Carlos Tevez. Not in a physical sense - Dybala is baby-faced and far slighter than his predecessor, even if Juventus's athletic staff will attest that he has added 3kg of muscle since he arrived - but in their shared hunger for the ball, quick feet and readiness to run at a defence.
"Tevez who?" asked Tuttosport in a provocative front-page headline last week. Nobody has really forgotten about the man who fired them to the brink of the treble. But in Turin they sure are excited about the (EURO)40m kid who has arrived to fill his boots.

Talking points
∑ It's looking more and more like a two-horse race at the top, and HiguaÌn was among the scorers once again for Napoli, making it 21 goals in as many games. So, too, was Lorenzo Insigne, and their 30 combined goals are, according to Monday's Gazzetta dello Sport, the most of any strike partnership in the club's history - more even than Maradona and Careca ever managed - at this stage of a campaign. Napoli have been looking a bit less certain at the other end of the pitch lately, though, and the 4-2 win over Samp was the sixth game in a row (including the Coppa Italia) in which they have failed to keep a clean sheet.
∑ Unless you've been hiding under a rock, you'll be well aware by now of the sideline altercation between Sarri and Roberto Mancini during last week's Coppa Italia clash, in which the Napoli manager was accused of calling his counterpart, among other things, a "faggot". The sporting justice's apparent conclusion that such a remark did not constitute homophobia, since Mancini is not gay, is not one that I can get on board with, but if nothing else at least the two men seem to have cleared the air with one another. Sarri wore one of the Inter manager's scarves in a peace gesture on Sunday.
∑ Mancini did joke that he'd be only too happy to have a loan of HiguaÌn in return, and could have done with some help up front this weekend. The Nerazzurri 's failure to close out a victory against Carpi, despite leading 1-0 with a one-man advantage late on, pushed the manager into a rage. "A team like Inter needs to score more than once," he said. "One goal is not enough and we probably need to go into the market now and buy an attacker. There are some goals that even I could score at 50 years old."
∑ On the other side of that particular coin, what a day this was for Kevin Lasagna - scoring his first Serie A goal, against the team he supported as a boy, barely 18 months after Carpi plucked him from the depths of Serie D. "I've been itching for the chance to buy the team dinner," he said. "I'd been promising it if I scored a goal." All of which begs the obvious question: what does a Lasagna eat for his evening meal?
∑ Inter's slip allowed Fiorentina to finish the weekend back in third place, and the Viola are attacking this transfer window with the purpose of a team that is deadly serious about taking that final Champions League berth. Giuseppe Rossi has departed for Levante on a six-month loan (a solution that I think probably is best for everyone at this point ) but in his stead Mauro Z·rate, Tino Costa and, perhaps most intriguingly, Cristian Tello have all arrived.
∑ Lovely free-kick from former Liverpool man Suso for Genoa against Verona. I did enjoy the bizarre distraction technique involving his three team-mates, too.
                     Results: Empoli 2-2 Milan, Fiorentina 2-0 Torino, Frosinone 0-0 Atalanta, Inter 1-1 Carpi, Juventus 1-0 Roma, Lazio 4-1 Chievo, Palermo 4-1 Udinese, Sampdoria 2-4 Napoli, Sassuolo 0-2 Bologna, Verona 1-1 Genoa.

Nobody could accuse Erika Andiola or CÈsar Vargas of joining Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign because they fantasized about working in the West Wing. As "Dreamers", young immigrants protected by presidential action, his Latino outreach directors keenly feel the limits that bound their ambitions.
Not only will the young Mexicans be barred from voting for the Vermont senator as he campaigns for the Democratic nomination this spring, they will also be blocked from the polls in November, after devoting more than a year of their lives to the election. And should Sanders win the nomination and the presidency, they will also be prohibited from following him into the White House.

"Only US citizens get to work at the White House," Vargas said ruefully, speaking in the bustling Sanders headquarters in Burlington, Vermont. "But that's what this campaign is all about for us - we cannot vote, but we do have a voice." 
Three hundred miles away in downtown Brooklyn, a similar dynamic is playing out in Hillary Clinton's headquarters. Clinton's core team may be approximately 10 times bigger than Sanders' 30 people - she has about 300 packed into the entire floor of an office block - but here too a "Dreamer" can be found at the pulsing heart of the operation.
Her name is Lorella Praeli, and she leads the team seeking to move the massive Hispanic electorate to help put Clinton in the White House. Unlike her counterparts in the Sanders camp, she could taste life in the West Wing should her boss win.

Joe McGinniss's book The Selling of a President is widely regarded as a peerless look inside the inner workings of a presidential campaign. It paints a warts-and-all picture of the neurotic, unhinged politician - one Richard Nixon - that the world came to know in greater depth after the scandal that ended his career. It was also a cautionary tale for any politician who ever thought about giving a journalist almost unlimited access to their campaign. 
That warning went unheard by the group running Anthony Weiner's disastrous mayoral bid in 2014, and documentary fans should rejoice for it.  The resulting film is a riveting excursion into fear and loathing on the campaign trail. The film caused a stir before its premiere because of the access the team got to not only Weiner but also his wife, Huma Abedin, who is Hillary Clinton's top aide. 
    The comeback that wasn't. Photograph: Kathy Willens/AP   
The couple's relationship dominates much of the action. Their marriage was already strained following Weiner's  2011 resignation from the US House of Representatives, following leaks to the press that he sent sexts to several women. (It's tested after Weiner again succumbs to temptation and sends more explicit pictures.) The film puts their relationship under an unflinching microscope. We see them in their kitchen, feeding their child and having increasingly tense conversations.
The documentary team of Josh Kreigman and Elyse Steinberg do more than focus on the pics, though. Weiner is presented as a passionate career politician, a leader who took on the Republicans who tried to block healthcare assistance for 9/11 first responders. He's clearly a gifted orator who knows what makes people tick - but just can't seem to stop himself from ruining the hard work he's done to rebuild his reputation.

The other day in Manhattan, Hillary Clinton supporters met for lunch at the home of the media executive Geraldine Laybourne. A group of 50, mostly women, was determined to generate excitement for Clinton's campaign for president. They were frustrated to see her lagging again among younger voters, and their invited speaker was Kenyatta Cheese, a young Obama campaign veteran and internet impresario.
The debate sparring that night between Clinton and Bernie Sanders over who belongs to the establishment was another reflection of how perilous it is to be an insider this American political season. And it is galling for politically seasoned women to watch Sanders caricature Clinton as an establishmentarian worshipping at the altar of Goldman Sachs. "When you are in the White House, you're going to be connected to the establishment," says Sarah Kovner, who served in the Clinton administration and was at Laybourne's lunch. "That's just a fact."

Sanders put Hillary Clinton on notice last summer, when no one was paying him much heed. "All over this country," he declared, "ordinary people, working people, elderly people are moving in our direction because they do want a candidate to take on the establishment."
During that most recent Democratic debate in South Carolina, I read texts about Clinton by some students at Harvard, where I teach, and talked to some afterwards. Although Clinton's difficulties with young voters have been much written about, their comments revealed a more acute ennui.
"Hillary, can you excite us?" asks Osaremen Okolo, a 21-year-old African-American who supports Clinton but "misses feeling fired up" as she was for Barack Obama and as some of her friends feel about Sanders.
"Young people like Bernie because he sounds like a revolutionary," she says. But Okolo prefers Clinton's experience and positions on issues like equal pay for equal work and criminal justice reform. "Hillary sounds pragmatic, which can come across as stuffy to young people. Her experience can almost count against her." She adds: "Sanders seems bold, even if none of his ideas can happen."

It is an unlikely-looking spot from which to plot a revolution. The third-floor suite in Burlington that serves as the national headquarters for Bernie Sanders' insurgent presidential campaign in fact looks more like a small-town law office: surprisingly busy for a Friday evening, perhaps, but hardly the den of communist sympathisers some Democratic opponents claim it to be.
In contrast to his frontline base in a faded mall in Iowa, from where Sanders is threatening to upstage Hillary Clinton in next week's Democratic caucus, the prosperous streets here in Vermont's biggest city are buzzing with, well, capitalism - a legacy, say locals, of regeneration during the senator's tenure as mayor in the 1980s.
...Instead, the mood inside the Sanders headquarters as they prepare for the biggest week of their political careers is a very Vermont mixture of surprise and quiet satisfaction....

 David Axelrod, the engineer and adviser behind Barack Obama's two presidential victories, is beating himself up for having made fun, early on, of the Trump presidential candidacy. 
Axelrod should have seen the Trump's appeal, he writes in the New York Times, because Trump's candidacy has strong parallels with Obama in 2008 :
Here's the gist. Open-seat presidential elections are shaped by perceptions of the style and personality of the outgoing incumbent. Voters rarely seek the replica of what they have. They almost always seek the remedy, the candidate who has the personal qualities the public finds lacking in the departing executive.
 Is Trump the next Obama?  Seems kind of like a triple bank shot of political analysis. But proof of Axelrod's political chops sits in the White House.

 Trump derides Sikh protester's 'hat'  
Time to  take out the trash  round up the latest unsettling scenes from the Donald Trump campaign choo-choo.
On Sunday, a Sikh man who had the guts to stand up at a Trump rally and unfurl a sign reading "Stop Hate" got the full Trump treatment. The crowd, which appears transplanted from a Manila cockfight, jeers and gestures from the bleachers as the man is led out. 
Then Trump piles on, focusing on the man's religious garb. "Naw, he wasn't wearing one of those hats, was he?" Trump says, adding somewhat incoherently:
And he never will! And he never will. And that's OK. But we've got to do something, because it's not working.

You've lived long enough to watch your crowning achievement of bringing democracy to Iraq be destroyed by a Democratic president who withdrew American troops just as things there were shaping up. You've done the Errol Morris documentary. You've published a memoir. 
What's left to do? Solitaire app, of course.  
Donald Rumsfeld, t he two-time US secretary of defence who presided over the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan,  has released a video game, Alex Hern writes: 
The game, initially released as an iOS app, is based on a version of solitaire favoured by Winston Churchill. The variant uses two decks of cards rather than one, 10 rows of cards instead of seven, and an extra pile of six cards called "the Devil's Six" for the player to work into their strategy.

 Obama plays down Sanders, pumps up Clinton  
This Monday morning has delivered a true politics must-read in the form of Politico's Glenn Thrush's interview with Barack Obama. 
Obama says Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has 'luxury'  of being long shot : 
Bernie came in with the luxury of being a complete long shot and just letting loose," he said. "I think Hillary came in with the both privilege - and burden - of being perceived as the frontrunner... You're always looking at the bright, shiny object that people haven't seen before - that's a disadvantage to her."
     Bernie's no Obama. Photograph: Paul Sancya/AP   
Obama compares Clinton in 2008 to Ginger Rogers : 'backwards in heels': 
She had to do everything that I had to do, except, like Ginger Rogers, backwards in heels," he said. "She had to wake up earlier than I did because she had to get her hair done. She had to, you know, handle all the expectations that were placed on her."
Obama says Clinton started off 'rusty' :
She is better in "small groups" than big ones, he remarked, and he agreed that her first campaign appearances showed her to be "rusty" - comparing them to his God-awful first debate of the 2012 campaign. "[S]he's extraordinarily experienced - and, you know, wicked smart and knows every policy inside and out - [and] sometimes [that] could make her more cautious, and her campaign more prose than poetry," he told me.

Hello and welcome to our live-wire coverage of the 2016 race for the White House. One Week Till Iowa.  Is the Republican party about to nominate Donald Trump for president ? These races can see lots of movement right at the end as voters start to focus on the race and the field winnows. So let's check on the polls in the Hawkeye State GOOD GOD.
Trump's up another five points in polling averages in Iowa on the strength of back-to-back CNN and Fox News surveys showing him leading Texas senator Ted Cruz by 11 points. Trump gained 15 points on Cruz in the Fox poll after Cruz started attacking Trump earlier this month, the Washington Post points out.
For an extra boost, a Trump Iowa rally at the weekend featured the very senior Republican senator from the state, Chuck Grassley. It wasn't an endorsement, mind you. But here's a snapshot: the establishment and The Donald.
    Weird. Photograph: Mary Altaffer/AP   
We'll know more soon! Here's what else is happening on this Monday morning in politics, and some of what you may have missed over the weekend.
 Obama pseudo-endorses Clinton 
In an interview with Politico, Barack Obama "couldn't hide his obvious affection for [Hillary] Clinton or his implicit feeling that she, not [Bernie] Sanders, best understands the unpalatably pragmatic demands of a presidency he likens to the world's most challenging walk-and-chew-gum exercise," Glenn Thrush writes. 
[The] one thing everybody understands is that this job right here, you don't have the luxury of just focusing on one thing," Obama said.
There's a lot more in the interview and we'll take a closer look later.
 Bloomberg said to weigh presidential run 
If you had a Forbes-estimated $36bn and you saw a presidential race shaping up between Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders ... well, former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, "  sensing an opening  ", is thinking about running for president, again, the New York Times reports. 
enltrCan we fast-forward to when Bloomberg's executive order to ban large sodas and salted pretzels is taken up by SCOTUS?

Iowa's most influential news rag has taken its stand. Discouragingly for Clinton, the Register is bad at picking Democratic nominees - it picked her back in 2008, too! But there are countervailing signs that the paper can in fact boost candidates. We report, you decide. 
Clinton also picked up the Boston Globe endorsement in the 9 February primary in New Hampshire, just across the border from Beantown.

  Trump nemesis Megyn Kelly to co-host GOP debate Thursday  
Remember when we were wondering whether Trump's fighting with Fox News would endanger his election chances? That turns out not to have been a strong line of analysis. Anyway, Fox News has declined to accede to Trump's demand that host Megyn Kelly, whom Trump attacked in August, sit out Thursday night's debate. Kelly will host, Fox says. 
 Tina Fey did Sarah Palin endorsing Trump  on Saturday Night Live on Saturday. Night. 
Here's where some of the team is deployed today:
 Dan Roberts and Ben Jacobs are in Iowa, preparing for a big Democratic candidate forum in Des Moines at 9pm ET. It's technically not a debate as they take turns on stage, but it's in effect their last big live TV moment to convince voters before caucus day next Monday. 
 Sabrina Siddiqui is in Iowa to watch freshman senator Joni Ernst stump for Marco Rubio for president in a midday event - it's not an endorsement, endorsement fans, but like Grassley's greeting of Trump, it assuredly Means Something - and then Sabrina switches buses to catch a Clinton rally.
 Ben Jacobs and Dan Roberts will catch up with Bernie Sanders in Grinnell, Iowa, this afternoon, and Dan has a piece coming from his weekend trip to Sanders campaign headquarters in Burlington, Vermont.
 Dan Roberts is going to see former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee recreating at a firing range in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, at noon.

Joe McGinniss's book The Selling of a President is widely regarded as a peerless look inside the inner workings of a presidential campaign. It paints a warts-and-all picture of the neurotic, unhinged politician - one Richard Nixon - that the world came to know in greater depth after the scandal that ended his career. It was also a cautionary tale for any politician who ever thought about giving a journalist almost unlimited access to their campaign. 
That warning went unheard by the group running Anthony Weiner's disastrous mayoral bid in 2014, and documentary fans should rejoice for it.  The resulting film is a riveting excursion into fear and loathing on the campaign trail. The film caused a stir before its premiere because of the access the team got to not only Weiner but also his wife, Huma Abedin, who is Hillary Clinton's top aide. 
    The comeback that wasn't. Photograph: Kathy Willens/AP    
The couple's relationship dominates much of the action. Their marriage was already strained following Weiner's  2011 resignation from the US House of Representatives, following leaks to the press that he sent sexts to several women. (It's tested after Weiner again succumbs to temptation and sends more explicit pictures.) The film puts their relationship under an unflinching microscope. We see them in their kitchen, feeding their child and having increasingly tense conversations.
The documentary team of Josh Kreigman and Elyse Steinberg do more than focus on the pics, though. Weiner is presented as a passionate career politician, a leader who took on the Republicans who tried to block healthcare assistance for 9/11 first responders. He's clearly a gifted orator who knows what makes people tick - but just can't seem to stop himself from ruining the hard work he's done to rebuild his reputation.

The other day in Manhattan, Hillary Clinton supporters met for lunch at the home of the media executive Geraldine Laybourne. A group of 50, mostly women, was determined to generate excitement for Clinton's campaign for president. They were frustrated to see her lagging again among younger voters, and their invited speaker was Kenyatta Cheese, a young Obama campaign veteran and internet impresario.
The debate sparring that night between Clinton and Bernie Sanders over who belongs to the establishment was another reflection of how perilous it is to be an insider this American political season. And it is galling for politically seasoned women to watch Sanders caricature Clinton as an establishmentarian worshipping at the altar of Goldman Sachs. "When you are in the White House, you're going to be connected to the establishment," says Sarah Kovner, who served in the Clinton administration and was at Laybourne's lunch. "That's just a fact."
    And I just can't hide it! Photograph: Patrick Semansky/AP   
Sanders put Hillary Clinton on notice last summer, when no one was paying him much heed. "All over this country," he declared, "ordinary people, working people, elderly people are moving in our direction because they do want a candidate to take on the establishment."
During that most recent Democratic debate in South Carolina, I read texts about Clinton by some students at Harvard, where I teach, and talked to some afterwards. Although Clinton's difficulties with young voters have been much written about, their comments revealed a more acute ennui.
"Hillary, can you excite us?" asks Osaremen Okolo, a 21-year-old African-American who supports Clinton but "misses feeling fired up" as she was for Barack Obama and as some of her friends feel about Sanders.
"Young people like Bernie because he sounds like a revolutionary," she says. But Okolo prefers Clinton's experience and positions on issues like equal pay for equal work and criminal justice reform. "Hillary sounds pragmatic, which can come across as stuffy to young people. Her experience can almost count against her." She adds: "Sanders seems bold, even if none of his ideas can happen."

 Ben Jacobs and Dan Roberts will catch up with Bernie Sanders in Grinnell, Iowa, this afternoon, and Dan has a piece coming from his weekend trip to Sanders campaign headquarters in Burlington, Vermont.
 Dan Roberts is going to see former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee recreating at a firing range in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, at noon.

Gulam Bodi banned for 20 years for Ram Slam match-fixing attempts; 
∑ Cricket South Africa imposes ban after former international admits charges ∑ 'Bodi's actions have threatened the integrity and image of the game we love'.

Guardian sport.

Cricket South Africa has banned the former international Gulam Bodi for 20 years after he admitted charges of contriving or attempting to fix matches in last year's Ram Slam Twenty20 competition. 
Bodi, who admitted the charges on 18 January, played three limited-overs matches for South Africa in 2007 and stopped playing last year.
A statement on Cricket South Africa's website said Bodi was immediately banned from involvement in all CSA, International Cricket Council or other national cricket federation matches. But five of those years have been suspended on condition Bodi "commits no further offences under the code and demonstrates to CSA's reasonable satisfaction he has actively and constructively participated in corruption-related player education programmes when asked to do so".
The CSA chief executive, Haroon Lorgat, said: "CSA thoroughly considered all the relevant factors and determined that a lengthy ban was appropriate.
"Our attitude to corruption will always be one of zero tolerance. There is no doubt Mr Bodi's actions have threatened the integrity and image of the game we love and he must be handed a strong punishment. We have had many discussions with Mr Bodi and he accepts the folly of his actions."
Investigators looking into the corruption scandal were understood to have spoken to 47 players and staff in the country, with two active former Test cricketers among those believed to have been involved.

Weiner review: an unsparing portrait of politics and a gift that keeps giving; 
Documentary about former congressman Anthony Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin channels the spirit of the best and most surreal political journalism.

Lanre Bakare.

Star Rating: 5 stars
Joe McGinniss's book The Selling of a President is widely regarded as a peerless look inside the inner workings of a presidential campaign. It paints a warts-and-all picture of the neurotic, unhinged politician - one Richard Nixon - that the world came to know in greater depth after the scandal that ended his career. It was also a cautionary tale for any politician who ever thought about giving a journalist almost unlimited access to their campaign. 
That warning went unheard by the group running Anthony Weiner's disastrous mayoral bid in 2014, and documentary fans should rejoice for it. The resulting film is a riveting excursion into fear and loathing on the campaign trail. The film caused a stir before its premiere because of the access the team got to not only Weiner but also his wife, Huma Abedin, who is Hillary Clinton's top aide.  
The couple's relationship dominates much of the action. Their marriage was already strained following Weiner's  2011 resignation from the US House of Representatives, following leaks to the press that he sent sexts to several women. (It's tested after Weiner again succumbs to temptation and sends more explicit pictures.) The film puts their relationship under an unflinching microscope. We see them in their kitchen, feeding their child and having increasingly tense conversations.
The documentary team of Josh Kreigman and Elyse Steinberg do more than focus on the pics, though. Weiner is presented as a passionate career politician, a leader who took on the Republicans who tried to block healthcare assistance for 9/11 first responders. He's clearly a gifted orator who knows what makes people tick - but just can't seem to stop himself from ruining the hard work he's done to rebuild his reputation. 
After the second scandal, when MSNBC journalist Lawrence O'Donnell asks Weiner "What is wrong with you," it's hard to not empathise with his frustration. Unlike Alex Giney's Lance Armstrong documentary, which charted the cyclist's fall, it's hard to feel complete contempt for this politician. It feels more like a political tragedy that a comedy writer like Armando Iannucci would construct, especially when one aide screams about implementing the "McDonald's plan" - a plot to sneak Weiner into his own celebration party via fast food restaurant, because one of the people he sexted is waiting for him outside.
Eventually, the film becomes about Weiner's enthusiasm and apparent inability to understand when he should back down. He soldiers on, regardless of the pain he inflicts on his family and closest aides. His energy leads him to surreal ends: Colombian and Israeli celebrations, even finding himself MC on a Caribbean parade float.
It's that total access which makes the documentary a compelling, deep dive into a scandal that so many, especially the New York Post and Stephen Colbert, had painted as the simple - and crude - case of one prurient politician. Weiner is abused in the street, his marriage "to an Arab" raised in an ugly altercation - yet even in these brutal scenes he rarely asks for the cameras to leave. 
The only time he shows frustration with the film-makers is when he asks whether flies on the wall should be able to ask questions. That inability to stop himself in front of a camera is his biggest asset and biggest flaw. For Steinberg and Kreigman it's the gift that keeps on giving.

Tesco could be fined £500m over accounting scandal, say analysts; 
Serious Fraud Office, which is investigating shortfall in retailer's accounts, may reveal results of inquiry this week, it is claimed.

Graham Ruddick.

Tesco could face a £500m fine for the accounting scandal at the retailer, analysts have warned.
The Serious Fraud Office may announce the findings of its investigation into the £326m black hole in the company's accounts as early as this week, according to Mike Dennis, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. 
Tesco suspended four executives after the chief executive, Dave Lewis, revealed in September 2014 that a shortfall had been found in the retailer's accounts relating to payments from suppliers. Tesco was accused of bringing forward payments to flatter its financial results as sales fell.
The SFO subsequently launched an investigation into the company. The Groceries Code Adjudicator, the supermarket regulator, is also investigating Tesco's treatment of suppliers.

Dennis said the SFO could fine Tesco more than £350m and force it to repay hundreds of millions of pounds to suppliers that it claimed in what has been called "arbitrary unjustified cash payments".
He said the scope of the alleged fraud at Tesco might be far greater than has been revealed so far. Dennis estimated that the amount Tesco collected from supplier payments rose by £1.7bn over five years to £2.4bn in February 2014 and accounts for 30% of cash profits.
"To secure a case against Tesco, the SFO needs to link the commercial income fraud to a controlling board director and senior management by ' mens rea ', where 'the acts and state of mind' of those who represent the 'directing mind and will' of the company can be attributed to the employees' behaviour and fraud, in our view," Dennis said. 
"We believe [that] Tesco could be fined 1% or more of its UK grocery sales or £350m on £35bn of sales. In addition, there might be individual prosecutions after applying the identification principle to controlling officers of the company. The SFO could also add punitive fines to deter other grocery retailers and force repayments which together could cost Tesco £500m."
                     Tesco declined to comment. Shares in the company fell more than 1% in Monday morning trading.

Rod Laver, master of Australian tennis, heads sporting honours list; 
Tennis great is joined on honours list by recently-retired player Lleyton Hewitt and sports administrator David Gallop.

Paul Connolly.

Such are the accomplishments of Australia's best ever male tennis player that if there's any surprise at Rod Laver being appointed a companion (AC) of the Order of Australia it's that he hadn't already received the honour.
Made a Member of the British Empire in 1970 - a year after he won all four grand slam tournaments in the same calendar year for the second time - Laver, 77, was one of just 10 recipients of the top honour, recognised for his "eminent service to tennis as a player, representative and mentor, at the national and international level, and as a role model for young sportsmen and women". 
Born in Rockhampton, Queensland, the left-handed Laver, nicknamed "Rocket", won 11 grand slam singles titles - and contributed to six doubles titles, three mixed doubles titles and five Davis Cup titles - despite being banned from amateur tennis, including grand slam events, between 1963 and 1968 for turning professional. When professionalism was embraced in 1968, Laver added five grand slam singles titles to the six he won before 1963.
As Laver said in 2013, when named as a global ambassador of the Australian Open, "I had a long career, had a chance to meet a ton of people, had good successes ... I was thrilled to be a part of the tennis world ... The one thing I guess I'm even more proud of is the fact that my opponents became my best friends."
Other sporting figures were acknowledged in the Australia Day honours. Tennis player Lleyton Hewitt, whose 18-year professional career ended just days ago at the Australian Open, equestrian administrator and three-time Olympian Barry Roycroft and Football Federation Australia chief executive David Gallop were all named a Member of the Order of Australia (AM). Horse racing commentator Greg Miles, basketball administrator and four-times Olympian Andrew Vlahov, and rugby league administrator John Chalk, were awarded Order of Australia medals.
While he may have endured a difficult past year - what with player pay disputes, fan boycotts and Perth Glory's salary cap scandal - Gallop was recognised for his "significant service to sports administration through executive roles with football and rugby league organisations, and to the community". He began his administrative career in sport as Super League's legal affairs manager in 1995 before becoming deputy chair of the Australian Sports Commission and chief executive of the National Rugby League. 
As well as well-known sporting figures the Australia Day honours also acknowledge those who work behind the scenes, often without significant remuneration or acclaim, and are the lifeblood of grass roots sporting organisations around the country. 
Ralph Devlin QC was made a member of the Order of Australia mainly for his services to surf lifesaving. A lifesaver with Maroochydore Surf Life Saving Club since 1971, Devlin went on to become the president of the club, president of Surf Life Saving Queensland and deputy president of Surf Life Saving Australia. 
The late Kenneth Russell Clifford, also made a member of the Order of Australia, was president of both the Newcastle Basketball Association and Newcastle District Cricket Association and he was involved in establishing and managing the Annual Academy Festival of Sport between 1991 and 2014.
Another AM was Kelwin Pell, 88, who can't be found on Google but is part of the fabric of the Bendigo sporting community.
A boundary umpire in the Bendigo Football League for 25 years between 1947 and 1972, Pell - a fitter and turner who worked on the railways "and went through the steam engine phase" - was the founding member and secretary of the Bendigo East Tennis Club, secretary of the Bendigo Tennis Association between 1952 and 1976, founder and administrator of Bendigo Country Tennis Week for 25 years, and a founding member (in 1974) and past executive member of the Bendigo Athletics Club - where he also coached.
"I suppose it was because I was really interested in the sports," Pell told Guardian Australia about why he contributed so many years to amateur sport, "and it was good to give young people a chance to develop and to be part of a community."
And how much did he earn from the decades he dedicated to sport in Bendigo?
"Nothing in terms of money, they were honorary jobs in those days" he said. "But I did get a lot of satisfaction."
