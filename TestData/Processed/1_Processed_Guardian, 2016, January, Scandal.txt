Guardian critics.

Film
                     1) Joy                      David O Russell is the semi-reformed wild man of US indie-studio cinema, a director renowned for his flareups and bustups. His last movie was the disastrous and abandoned comedy Accidental Love; before that was the much admired true-crime comedy-drama American Hustle. Now he returns with an intriguing drama co-scripted with Bridesmaids writer Annie Mumolo: Jennifer Lawrence plays a young woman who invents a "miracle mop" and becomes matriarch of a family business empire. PB 1 January (UK). 
                     2) The Danish Girl                     Eddie Redmayne follows up his Oscar-winning turn as Stephen Hawking by playing transgender artist Lili Elbe, who underwent gender reassignment surgery in 1930s Berlin. It's a glossy, good-looking piece, as you would expect from the Les MisÈrables and King's Speech director Tom Hooper. Redmayne exudes a doomed glamour, and it features an outstanding co-lead in Alicia Vikander, playing Elbe's wife, Gerda Wegener - an accomplished artist and free spirit. AP 1 January (UK), 27 November (US), 26 December (Aus). 
                     3) The Hateful Eight                      Quentin Tarantino 's new movie is a western, reportedly inspired by the feel of classic TV shows such as Bonanza and The Virginian. It also looks to be about an intense confrontation reminiscent of his great debut Reservoir Dogs - a return to the Mexican standoff style that so energises him as a writer. Like Django Unchained, it concerns bounty hunters. In 19th-century Wyoming, a bunch of these adventurers are stranded together during a storm, while one is bringing in a prisoner. All face betrayal and deception and a battle to survive. PB8 January (UK), 21 January (Aus).
                     4) Room                      Based on Emma Donoghue's novel, and indirectly inspired by the Fritzl and Kampusch cases, this movie tells the terrifying story of a woman and her infant son kept captive in a tiny room. This space is all that the child has ever known, and when he reaches his fifth birthday, his mother makes a decision: they have to escape. Brie Larson's lead performance has been much praised, and this is an intriguing new direction for director Lenny Abrahamson. PB15 January (UK), 28 January (Aus).
                     5) The Revenant                     Birdman director Alejandro Gonz·lez IÒ·rritu signed up for this epic western, based on a novel by Michael Punke, and landed Leonardo DiCaprio for the lead role of a trapper who is left for dead by his companions and then hunts them down in revenge. It was largely shot in the far north of Canada, and some hair-raising tales of harsh working conditions emerged from the set - but presumably that just helped IÒ·rritu create the requisite atmosphere of ordeal. AP 15 January (UK), 15 December (US), 7 January (Aus).
                     6) Our Brand Is Crisis                     A fascinating combination: crack British screenwriter Peter Straughan and American director David Gordon Green, the film-maker who started his career as a Malickian auteur before going over to stoner comedies. They're teaming up for a fictionalisation of a 2005 documentary about American PR flacks and spin doctors who are hired by Bolivian politicians to organise their presidential campaign. Sandra Bullock and Billy Bob Thornton are the two old rivals who find themselves facing off in South America. PB22 January (UK), 4 February (Aus).
                     7) The Assassin  Hou Hsiao-Hsien's new film is commandingly beautiful: a mysterious and mesmeric wuxia romance taken from the eighth-century tale Nie Yinniang. Shu Qi plays a princess who is abducted as a child by a nun in exile, and trained to become a killer for the purpose of assassinating corrupt politicians. After failing in a task, she is sent to murder her own cousin as punishment. The sheer mastery and artistry of the film's composition, and its uncompromising adagio pace, give it the quality of a disturbing dream. PB 22 January (UK)
                     8) 13 Hours                     Michael Bay wades into the political arena with this account of the hot-potato crisis that led to the death of the US ambassador to Libya at the hands of militant Islamists in 2012. Bay is a director not exactly renowned for his subtlety of analysis - remember what he did to Pearl Harbor in 2002? - and this film has the potential to be a Stonewall-style embarrassment for him, and to attract the ire of politicos who see this as part of a plan to knock Hillary Clinton's presidential bid. AP 29 January (UK), 15 January (US), 14 January (Aus).
                     9) Spotlight                     A dour, downbeat paean to old media and the reporter as footslogging door-knocker, Spotlight echoes the glories of Watergate-era dramas as it details the Boston Globe's unmasking of child sex abuse by Catholic priests in the Massachusetts capital. The title comes from the Globe's special investigative team, led here by Michael Keaton and Mark Ruffalo, pounding the pavements and defying authority to uncover the truth. Stirring stuff. AP 29 January (UK), 6 November (US).
                     10) Innocence of Memories                     Turkey's Nobel prize-winning novelist Orhan Pamuk is the quasi-subject of this poetic travelogue by British director Grant Gee, following his earlier film essay on WG Sebald. Pamuk's novel The Museum of Innocence - and the real-life museum Pamuk created as a counterpart to his fictional one - is the focus, but the film transmutes into Pamuk's own discourse on Istanbul, the city he loves, and on which he is an illuminating commentator. AP 29 January (UK). 
                     11) The 33                     The rescue of 33 Chilean miners after a cave collapse in 2010 was always a certainty for a cinema adaptation, given that it was one of the most heartwarming news stories of the past 10 years. The resulting film is stolid rather than brilliant, with the underlying drama of the actual events ballasting a distinctly syrupy, soapy treatment. Antonio Banderas holds it together as "Super Mario" Sepulveda, and director Patricia Riggen pulls off some large-scale effects sequences. AP 29 January (UK), February 4 (Aus).
                     12) Youth                     Italian maestro Paolo Sorrentino follows his Oscar-winning The Great Beauty with another tale of jaded, older men in lushly visualised environments. Here, it's Michael Caine as a composer and Harvey Keitel as a film director, ruminating on the past and present while ensconced in a deluxe hotel in Switzerland. With English dialogue and Anglo-American stars (Rachel Weisz, Paul Dano and Jane Fonda also feature), Youth represents Sorrentino's big play for the international art cinema circuit. AP 29 January (UK).
                                            back to top                   
                     13) Dad's Army  Captain Mainwaring and his hapless Home Guard underlings get their first cinema workout since 1971 - no doubt in the same spirit as the St Trinian's reboots, which had the same director, Ol Parker. This film, however, has retained the series' second world war setting. It's got Toby Jones in the Arthur Lowe role, and Michael Gambon, Bill Nighy and Tom Courtenay filling out the major old-coot roles. The principal addition is Catherine Zeta-Jones as a glamorous reporter. AP 5 February (UK), 5 February (US).
                     14) Goosebumps                     The kiddie horror-novel series by RL Stine has proved immensely popular since the first one appeared in 1992, having just the right amount of menace to scare but not distress its audience. The film adaptation, from Shark Tale co-director Rob Letterman, was a long time coming, but its mix of live action and animation pulled in the crowds when it was released in the US in October, besting big name directors Steven Spielberg and Guillermo del Toro with Bridge of Spies and Crimson Peak respectively. A half-term treat, for sure. AP 5 February (UK), 26 December (Aus).
                     15) Trumbo                     Screenwriter Dalton Trumbo was one of the highest-profile casualties of the Hollywood blacklist, unable to get any credit for his film work between 1945 and 1960. The wheel has now turned full circle, with this handsomely mounted biopic starring Bryan Cranston, which chronicles Trumbo's entanglement in the paranoid mood of postwar America, and his betrayal by a nervous film-making establishment. AP5 February (UK), 26 December (Aus).
                     16) A Bigger Splash                     Luca Guadagnino, the Italian director of I Am Love, is reunited with Tilda Swinton for this entertaining, fervent psychodrama, a remake/reworking of the 1969 Alain Delon film La Piscine. It's essentially a four-hander: Swinton and Belgian hunk Matthias Schoenaerts play a rock star and her lover holed up on a rocky Mediterranean island; their idyll is interrupted by her former boyfriend Ralph Fiennes, and slinky Dakota Johnson, whom he uses for wedge-driving purposes. Fiennes steals the show with a display of madcap energy. AP12 February (UK), 13 May (US).
                     17) Zoolander 2                     The Blue Steel look is back. The couture-bothering franchise takes another stroll down the movie catwalk, looking to cement Ben Stiller's reputation as the film industry's biggest fashion victim. The trailer for this makes it look like cameo-appearance hell, with Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus, Lewis Hamilton and Kim Kardashian all due to show their faces. Then there's Benedict Cumberbatch, showing up as androgynous model All - which has already led to accusations of transphobia. AP
                     12 February (UK), 12 February (US), 11 February (Aus).                   
                     18) Pride and Prejudice and Zombies                      Jane Austen fans are notoriously proprietorial and prickly about screen adaptations. How are they going to feel about this wacky out-of-copyright mashup, based on the bestselling novel ? Austen's classic tale of romance and the nuances of social prestige and the marriage market now has, erm, something new: an army of zombies. Elizabeth Bennet and her sisters are trained by their father as ninja warriors to fight the creepy creatures. Meanwhile, there's a definite spark between Elizabeth and the haughty yet dishy monster-killer Mr Darcy. Lily James is Elizabeth and Sam Riley is the damp-shirted hero. PB 12 February (UK), 5 February (US), 18 February (Aus).
                     19) Chronic  Portraying Sepp Blatter in a Fifa-sponsored movie wasn't a great moment for Tim Roth. But now he comes storming back with one of the best performances of his career. Arguably the best. He plays David, a homecare nurse for the terminally ill; a person who is exceptionally good at his job, conscientious, thorough, but dedicated to his patients to the point of Munchausen-like obsession, shutting out their own family and loved ones as the patient approaches death. It's a subtle, complex and challenging film, and Roth is excellent. PB 19 February (UK)
                     20) The Brothers Grimsby                     Comedy black-belt Sacha Baron Cohen made his movie breakthrough with the live-ammo prank masterpiece Borat. Now he returns with a conventional feature, an action-comedy in which he is the co-writer and star, teaming up with action director Louis Leterrier, who made the first two Transporter films. He plays Nobby Grimsby, a football hooligan whose brother Sebastian, played by Mark Strong, is the family's white sheep - an MI6 agent with a perfect life. But the brothers have to team up when Sebastian gets into danger.  PB 24 February (UK), 11 March (US), 3 March (Aus).
                     21) Hail, Caesar!                     The Coen brothers go back once again to the retro Hollywood well that served them so brilliantly in Barton Fink, but this time with the Chandleresque convolutions of The Big Lebowski. Hail Caesar is a film within the film: a Roman epic starring George Clooney, who disappears, presumed kidnapped. Trailer footage suggests that this latest entry in the Clooney-Coen "Numbskull" series is rendered with all the fantastic attention to detail for which the Coens are renowned. AP 26 February (UK), 5 February (US), 18 February (Aus).
                     22) Dheepan                     Jacques Audiard won the Cannes Palme d'Or with this downbeat study of a Sri Lankan immigrant in France - a veteran of his homeland's vicious civil war who transfers his battlefield skills to the rough housing estate he finds himself in. It has perhaps acquired a new topicality in the wake of the Paris attacks (though its sympathy is very much with the migrant), but its theme of menacing estate-dwellers may be a little familiar to British filmgoers. Nothing Audiard does is without interest, however, and this delivers a visceral jolt. AP 4 March (UK).
                     23) Hitchcock/Truffaut                     This very enjoyable documentary is a record of a pioneering act of cinema criticism that changed the way we think of cinema as an art form. In 1962, the young director FranÁois Truffaut visited Alfred Hitchcock, and over the course of a week conducted a series of interviews with him about his life and work. The resulting published conversation became a classic of cinephilia. The director Kent Jones interviews other directors including Martin Scorsese, James Gray, Wes Anderson, Arnaud Desplechin and Olivier Assayas, and their testimony is fascinating. PB4 March (UK).
                     24) Truth  A Broadcast News-type drama of journalistic integrity in the classic American style, based on a true story. In 2004, CBS News aired a special investigation into George W Bush's military record - a highly disobliging piece that caused a firestorm of rage from the White House, amplified by the new platform of social media. Cate Blanchett is on imperious form as producer Mary Mapes, and Robert Redford is legendary anchor Dan Rather. Both are wounded by the row, and find themselves enduring a dark night of the media soul. PB 4 March (UK).
                     25) Anomalisa  Charlie Kaufman's status as a modern American master has reached new heights with this stop-motion animation, which has conquered audiences at festivals all over the world. It's an eerie drama about the human condition, made even more compelling by the fact that it is not acted by humans but by latex dummies, in a world that attains its own uncanny-valley reality. David Thewlis voices Michael, an inspirational speaker going through a personal crisis in an anonymous hotel. 11 March (UK). 
                     26) High-Rise  One of the most anticipated British films of the year, from one of the most well-regarded British directors: Ben Wheatley. High-Rise is adapted by Amy Jump from JG Ballard's 1975 novel High-Rise : a horribly compelling study of how, within the supposedly coolly rational, technologically controlled spaces of a modern tower block, rage and despair and horror are incubated. Tom Hiddleston plays the lead, architect Dr Robert Laing.  PB 18 March (UK).
                     27) Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice  The DC Comics film universe belatedly gets into the match-up business with this follow-up to Man of Steel that pits, yes, Batman against, you guessed it, Superman. Henry Cavill returns as the latter while Ben Affleck shoehorns himself into cape and body armour as the Man of Bat. Prepping future films, we'll also see glimpses of Wonder Woman, Aquaman and Cyborg, with Jesse Eisenberg on hand as Superman's nemesis, Lex Luthor. AP 25 March (UK), 25 March (US), 24 March (Aus).
                     28) The Club                     The club in question is a nondescript house in a Chilean beach resort populated by disgraced priests and nuns, sent there by the Catholic church to meditate upon their sins and pray. It is part imprisonment, part internal exile and partly a kind of temporarily political "un-personing", which the Church might yet find it expedient to reverse. Chilean auteur Pablo LarraÌn finds in this arrangement an allegory for the Church itself. PB25 March (UK) 

Art
                     29) I am Van Dyck                     No, I am Van Dyck! This exhibition promises a more intimate understanding of the 17th-century painter whose works are highlights of this collection. It features Turner prizewinner Mark Wallinger, whose experiments in self-portraiture are shown next to Van Dyck's last self-portrait, painted just before the English civil war. The real point, though, is to reveal new discoveries about the gallery's Van Dycks, which include his heartstopping masterpiece Venetia, Lady Digby, on her Deathbed. JJ 12 January-24 April, Dulwich Picture Gallery, London.
                     30) MirÛ's Studio  This exhibition will recreate the studio Joan MirÛ built for himself on Mallorca where he created his late works. MirÛ said he was so hungry in Paris in the 1920s that he had hallucinations - which inspired some of his surrealist images. By the time he worked in his Mallorca studio he was no longer hungry, and could afford to create an ideal working space that made possible the big, carnival scale of his late paintings, sculptures and puppets. Ought to be beguiling. JJ
                     21 January-12 February, Mayoral at 6 Duke Street, London.                   
                     31) John Akomfrah  A double show for the acclaimed British film-maker. The Arnolfini in Bristol is showing his majestic, three-screen Vertigo Sea, which premiered at the 2015 Venice Biennale: an epic work concerning natural history, the whaling industry and our changing relationship to the environment. London's Lisson Gallery unveils new films made in Greece and Ghana, and other recent work. AS John Akomfrah: Vertigo Sea, 16 January-10 April, Arnolfini, Bristol ;John Akomfrah, 22 January-5 March,Lisson Gallery, London.
                     32) Dinh Q LÍ: The Colony                     The Vietnamese-American artist Dinh Q LÍ is best known for his work about the Vietnam war. The Colony, made in collaboration with Artangel, is an unfolding drama of 19th- and 20th-century greed, suffering and absurdity, filmed on guano-rich islands off the coast of Peru. Expect staged scenarios, animation and newly filmed footage, and tons of seabird droppings. AS 27 January-3 April, Ikon Gallery, Birmingham.
                     33) Electronic Superhighway (2016-1966)  I still haven't found the electronic superhighway. Maybe I took a wrong turn. This exhibition rewinds from the present to 1966, colliding with the internet, and with painting, sculpture, photography, drawing and multimedia works by more than 70 artists, bringing us key moments in the relationship between art and technology over the last 50 years. We're all post-internet now. AS29 January-15 May, Whitechapel Gallery, London.
                     34) Painting the Modern Garden: Monet to Matisse                     Monet's paintings of his garden are some of the most radical works of the 20th century. Reality dissolves into reflections and shadows, a world where nothing is certain, as the old painter gazes into his lily pond. It is no coincidence that Monet conceived the display of his waterlily decorations in the Orangerie in Paris as a war memorial. Anyone who thinks this survey of gardens in modern art sounds genteel is missing the point. The founders of modern art did some of their best thinking among the nympheas. JJ 30 January-20 April, Royal Academy, London.
                     35) Beyond Beauty: Transforming the Body in Ancient Egypt  Mummification and magic - you can't go wrong with ancient Egypt. This ambitious exhibition at one of London's most atmospheric venues concentrates on the lives, deaths and afterlives of ordinary people in the age of the pharaohs. It promises jewels, perfumes, portraits of the dead and, for the gory-minded, mummies, in a survey not just of antiquity but British collecting in the 19th and 20th centuries. JJ 30 January-24 April, Two Temple Place, London.
                     36) Elizabeth Price  This brilliant, shamanic artist who created the terrifying Turner prize-winning film The Woolworths Choir of 1979 has been let loose in the museums of Oxford. She has explored the collections of the Pitt Rivers museum and the Ashmolean and produced a film that meditates on archaeology in what is guaranteed to be a spooky way. It starts with the discovery of ancient Knossos and features one of Price's hypnotic percussive soundtracks. Be afraid, be very afraid. JJ4 February-10 April, Ashmolean Museum, Oxford.
                     37) Bruegel in Black and White  It's about time Britain got a big exhibition of Pieter Bruegel the Elder, the epic northern Renaissance visionary who gave the world Hunters in the Snow and The Tower of Babel. This will help in the meantime. It concentrates on Bruegel's nice little sideline in grisaille painting, which uses only black and white. In Bruegel's hands, the monochrome effect is troubling and macabre, with little faces etched darkly into the paint like monstrous imaginary sculptures. JJ 4 February-8 May, Courtauld, London.
                     38) Andy Warhol  Another Warhol exhibition? Well, this one is curated by Sir Norman Rosenthal, whose gift for putting on great exhibitions has not been seen enough since he left the Royal Academy. Rosenthal's eye is likely to turn up some new insights. And anyway, why not more Warhol? He's one of the most surprising modern artists, always revealing some hidden side or nuance of meaning that at first glance you never noticed. Linger on. JJ 4 February-15 May, Ashmolean, Oxford.
                     39) Hieronymus Bosch: Visions of Genius                     Five hundred years after the medieval artist's death in 1516, 20 of his 25 surviving painted panels, as well as 19 of his drawings, are returning to the town of his birth from museums around the world, and a carnivalesque Bosch 500 celebration will spill from his panels and into the streets. Watch out for monsters and devils, ecstasies and torments. AS13 February-8 May, Het Noordbrabants Museum, 's-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands.
                     40) The Imitation Game  During the last Manchester International festival, artist Ed Atkins morphed performers and directors into computer avatars. The resulting, final work will be seen in The Imitation Game, an exhibition inspired by Alan Turing's 1950 proposed test of computers' ability to imitate human thought. As well as Atkins, The Imitation Game includes video, sculpture and installation work by James Capper, Tove Kjellmark, Yu-Chen Wang, Paul Granjon, Mari Velonaki and David Link. AS 13 February-5 June, Manchester Art Gallery.
                     41) Delacroix and the Rise of Modern Art                     French romantic, orientalist and man about town EugËne Delacroix was a painter of literary scenes and historical events, of flowers and violence. While not the most fashionable of 19th-century French artists today, Delacroix was a key figure both for his contemporaries and for later artists including Courbet, GÈricault, Manet, CÈzanne, Van Gogh, Matisse and even Kandinsky, all of whom are included here. To get in the mood, read his wonderful Journal. AS17 February-22 May, National Gallery, London.
                     42) Mark Wallinger                     Wallinger has been a man in a bear suit, owner of a race horse called A Real Work of Art, sculptor, painter and devisor of labyrinthine maps for the London Underground. I'd keep him corralled before he causes more trouble. For his debut solo show with Hauser & Wirth, he will present a new multimedia work focused on themes of selfhood and self-expression. What a performance it has become. AS26 February-7 May, Hauser & Wirth, London.
                     43) Botticelli Reimagined                     Largely forgotten for more than 300 years until the 19th century, Sandro Botticelli (1445-1510) has gone on to influence art, design, fashion and film. The largest Botticelli exhibition in Britain since 1930 will include more than 50 original works by the artist, alongside works by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, William Morris, RenÈ Magritte, Andy Warhol and Cindy Sherman. Coinciding with this, the Courtauld Gallery will show more than 30 of Botticelli's amazing drawings for Dante's Divine Comedy, alongside other outstanding Renaissance illuminated manuscripts, many from the time of Botticelli. AS Botticelli Reimagined, 5 March-3 July, V&A, London ; Botticelli and Treasures from the Hamilton Collection, 18 February-8 May, Courtauld Gallery, London.
                     44) In the Age of Giorgione                     This is brave. In the Victorian era, Giorgione was as famous as Caravaggio is today (and no one had heard of Caravaggio). Today, this Venetian painter, lutenist and lover, who invented a new kind of pastoral erotic art, is comparatively obscure, and most of his masterpieces have been attributed to other people. So, in putting him back at the heart of Renaissance Venice, this exhibition may return a lost hero to art. JJ12 March-5 June, Royal Academy, London.
                     45) Russia and the Arts: The Age of Tolstoy and Tchaikovsky  This exhibition of portraits from the Tretyakov State Gallery in Moscow is a window on an age of hope, despair and tension, as Russians fought for democracy and social justice while anarchists and communists waited for the coming crisis. Dostoevsky and Chekhov are among the people portrayed, but this is also a chance to see how Russian art evolved in the 19th century. The Tretyakov is full of strange, sombre paintings, so this should be good. JJ 17 March-26 June, National Portrait Gallery, London.
                     46) Simon Starling                     The largest UK survey of 2005 Turner prize-winner Starling, who drowned a replica Henry Moore sculpture in Lake Ontario and let it get covered in zebra mussels; chopped up a boat he was travelling in and fed its timbers into the craft's boiler; and produced numerous sculptures and films concerned with culture and industry - journeys both physical and metaphorical. As part of an updated grand tour, Nottingham Contemporary is also collaborating with Derby Museums in an exhibition dedicated to Joseph Wright of Derby's (1734-97) formative years in Italy, alongside work by Starling. AS Simon Starling, 19 March-26 June, Nottingham Contemporary ; Joseph Wright and the Lure of Italy, 18 March-12 June, Derby Museum.
                     47) Fiji: Art and Life in the Pacific                     This claims to be the biggest ever exhibition about Fiji, with paintings going back to the 18th century, photographs from the colonial era and objects from Fiji telling its history and revealing its art. There's even a specially commissioned giant canoe, in what promises to be an epic cultural encounter. JJ From 15 October, Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts, Norfolk.
                     48) Comic Invention  Did you know that comics were invented in Glasgow? That is the claim of this exhibition, which includes The Glasgow Looking Glass, published in 1825 and a candidate for the first mass-produced comic book in the world. But the origin of comics is really a complicated question, for you can claim they started with Hogarth's narrative art, or even with medieval picture strips. This should be a fascinating journey through the history of visual storytelling, with contemporary art alongside the classics. JJ 18 March-17 July, Hunterian Art Gallery, Glasgow.
                     49) Glasgow International                     New works, site-specific commissions, exhibitions and events at more than 57 spaces across Glasgow. There will be work by 228 local and international artists, including a group show including Cosima Van Bonin and Amie Siegel at Tramway, whose spaces will be redesigned by Martin Boyce; leading Polish sculptor Monika Sosnowska at the Modern Institute; and projects by Marvin Gaye Chetwynd and "crypto conceptual science-fiction anti-climax band" Asparagus Piss Raindrop. Expect the serious and the silly. AS8-25 April. back to top

Architecture and design
                     50) Last Futures: Nature, Technology, and the End of Architecture by Douglas Murphy                     In this compelling piece of "archaeology of the present", architecture critic Douglas Murphy takes us back to the future of geodesic domes and plug-in cities, an era of brave utopian visions that emerged from the triple threats of the oil crisis, environmental armageddon and nuclear catastrophe in the 1970s. From Buckminster Fuller's plans to encapsulate Manhattan beneath a hermetic bubble to the metabolist capsule towers of Tokyo and hippy communes in the deserts of California, it promises to be a colourful romp through the wild hopes, dreams and failures of the last avant-garde - and what lessons their bold schemes might still hold. OW12 January, Verso Books.
                     51) Objection! Protest by Design                     Following on from the V&A's Disobedient Objects exhibition last year, this show zooms in on the tools of protest used during Hong Kong's spontaneous "Umbrella Revolution", which erupted from student protests in September 2014. It will present the ingenious range of objects and strategies spawned by the movement, from the barricades and shelters made from everyday objects, to impromptu structures that exploited the multi-levelled walkways of the city's Central district. OW26 February-29 May, Vitra Design Museum.
                     52) Undressed: A Brief History of Underwear                     From corsets and crinolines to boxer shorts and bras, the V&A will be raiding the underwear draw this spring to put on a big show of smalls throughout the ages. Exploring how the evolution of undergarments reflects changing attitudes to gender, sex and morality, along with health and hygiene, highlights will include long cotton drawers worn by Queen Victoria's mother, gender neutral briefs by Acne and raunchy flesh-coloured leggings decorated with a mirrored glass fig leaf by Vivienne Westwood. Not forgetting the 1950s Playtex rubber girdle. OW16 April-12 March, V&A, London.
                     53) Willem Sandberg: From Type to Image                     The modernist cruise liner of the De La Warr Pavilion in Bexhill continues its fantastic programme of graphic design exhibitions this spring with a retrospective on the work of Willem Sandberg, the man who introduced contemporary art to postwar Holland as director of Amsterdam's Stedelijk Museum from 1945 to 1963. Alongside building up one of the most important collections of modern art in Europe, Sandberg was a prolific graphic designer, producing hundreds of posters and catalogues for the museum - the ideas for which he would often sketch out during tedious board meetings. The exhibition will be the first time his entire body of work from the 30s to the 80s has been shown in the UK, and will showcase his groundbreaking use of "warm printing", torn paper cut-outs and experimental typography. OW April, De La Warr Pavilion, Bexhill.
                     54) Faena Forum, Miami, by OMA                     The criss-crossed concrete jewel in the crown of Argentine property developer and "lifestyle creator" Alan Faena's plan for an eight-block swath of Miami Beach, the Faena Forum promises to provide the Magic City with a dazzling new space for art projects and performances. Designed by Rem Koolhaas's practice OMA, it comprises a slashed concrete cylinder that rises to a ribbed dome topped with a glazed oculus, the whole thing encircled by spiralling ramps that will whisk visitors up from the street. OWSpring 2016. 

Photography
                     55) Saul Leiter  The belatedly acknowledged American pioneer of colour, who died in 2013, is given his first London solo show. Leiter began using Kodachrome colour slide film in the mid-1940s, long before the likes of the more lauded Stephen Shore and William Eggleston. His vivid, atmospheric, painterly street photos were all taken within a few blocks of his New York apartment and reveal the eye of a reclusive artist who started out as a painter. SOH 22 January-3 April, the Photographers' Gallery, London.
                     56) Janet Mendelsohn: Varna Road                     American photographer Janet Mendelsohn shot more than 3,000 photographs in the Balsall Heath area of Birmingham between 1967 and 1969, while she was a student at the University of Birmingham's Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies. This black and white series merges documentary and insider observation to chronicle the everyday life of a sex worker called Kathleen, whom Mendelsohn befriended. The context is a community being transformed by increasing immigration and rising levels of poverty and unemployment. SOH 27 January-3 April, Ikon, Birmingham.
                     57) Vogue 100: A Century of Style  Imagine that. Vogue was founded in 1916, the year of the Battle of the Somme. It shows that not everybody let the first world war get them down. And in the century since, it has published a designer sack full of glamorous, beautiful pictures. More than 280 prints from the CondÈ Nast archive will feature in this survey of changing fashions and famous faces. Cecil Beaton and Norman Parkinson are among the photographers, Fred Astaire and Claudia Schiffer among the stars. JJ 11 February-22 May, National Portrait Gallery, London.
                     58) Performing for the Camera  An ambitious historical show sets out to show how photography "both documented and developed our understanding of performance" from its inception as a medium in the 19th century to the present day. It will address the role of the pose in portraiture, look at collaborations between performance artists and photographers, and shed light on the approach of photographers such as Boris Mikhailov and Erwin Wurm, whose images depend on a degree of performance by their subjects. SOH 18 February-12 June, Tate Modern, London.
                     59) Strange and Familiar: Britain as Revealed by International Photographers                     The emphatically English Martin Parr curates a group show in which he looks at ways in which British culture has been portrayed though the lens of various international photographers from the 1930s onwards. Ranging across street photography, social documentary, portraiture and landscape photography, the exhibition includes series by Henri Cartier-Bresson (France) , Robert Frank (Swiss) , David Goldblatt (South African) as well as formalists such as Candida Hˆfer (Germany) and mavericks such as Hans van der Meer (Netherlands). It should make for a provocative take on Britishness as seen from the outside. SOH 16 March-19 June, Barbican, London.
                     60) Paul Strand: Photography and Film for the 20th Century                     A major retrospective of the work of an American master who died in 1976 and whose work helped define both art and documentary photography in the 20th century. Photographs, including vintage prints from the V&A's archive, plus films and objects, will map Strand''s restless journeying, which took him from America to Europe, Africa, the Middle East and beyond as he explored street photography, documentary, experiments in abstraction and close ups of organic and man-made forms. SOH 19 March-3 July, V&A, London. 

Theatre
                     61) Yen                     The winner of the 2013 Bruntwood prize, Anna Jordan's play deals with the redemption of two bereft teenagers, and was acclaimed on its debut at the Manchester Royal Exchange Studio for its ability to encompass extremes of violence and tenderness. Ned Bennett, who directed Pomona, confirms his extraordinary capacity to illuminate dark places. MB22 Jan-13 Feb, Royal Court Theatre Upstairs, London.
                     62) The Master Builder  David Hare comes up with a new version of Ibsen's late masterpiece about a middle-aged architect driven to scale new heights by the wild, visionary 23-year-old Hilde Wangel. Ralph Fiennes, superb in Shaw's Man and Superman, is the fatally ensnared Halvard Solness and the Australian actor Sarah Snook, who can currently be seen in Steve Jobs, is the young woman who comes knocking at his door. MB. 23 January-19 March, Old Vic, London.
                     63) Ma Rainey's Black Bottom                     The magnificent Sharon D Clarke, resplendent in The Amen Corner, stars as the eponymous heroine of August Wilson's play: part of his ambitious 10-play cycle recording the black American experience. Directed by Dominic Cooke, it is set in 1927 Chicago and shows the defiant Ma Rainey, Mother of the Blues, engaged in a fight for supremacy with her band's jazz-oriented young trumpeter. MB. 26 January-18 May, Lyttelton, London.
                     64) The Massive Tragedy of Madame Bovary!                     Purists look away now or have the smelling salts at the ready. Flaubert's novel gets a makeover from comedy theatre troupe Peepolykus, with some help from director Gemma Bodinetz. Nothing will be sacred, particularly not the daydreams of bored 19th-century housewife Emma Bovary, in a touring show heading to Liverpool, Bristol, Southampton and Northampton. Expect tears, but of laughter rather than tragedy. LG 5-27 February, Everyman, Liverpool. Then touring.
                     65) Motown: The Musical                     A big hit on Broadway, this show tells the story of Berry Gordy's rise from featherweight boxer to heavyweight media mogul, founder of the Motown label and mentor to Michael Jackson, Diana Ross, Marvin Gaye and many others. Featuring 50 songs, with great numbers from My Girl to Dancing in the Street, it may be the ultimate jukebox musical. MB Opens 11 February at Shaftesbury theatre, London.
                     66) The Destroyed Room  Taking its title from Jeff Wall's famed photograph of a ransacked room, which makes the viewer wonder what happened to leave it in such a state, the latest from the brilliantly inventive Vanishing Point considers Western privilege and the threats it faces. Matthew Lenton's productions have often had a particularly voyeuristic quality (one was entirely viewed through glass), and this one, touring Inverness, Glasgow, Edinburgh and London, teases at the ethics of what we look at and how we view and talk about the world from our window. LG 19-20 February, Eden Court, Inverness, then touring.
                     67) The Maids                     The Orange Is the New Black star Uzo Aduba and the brilliant Zawe Ashton are the murderous maids in Benedict Andrews and Andrew Upton's contemporary updating of Jean Genet's play - a glittering investigation into power relationships and identity, based on a real-life murder by the Papin sisters, which shocked France in the 1930s. Downton's Laura Carmichael plays Madam, and Jamie Lloyd directs. LG 20 February-21 May, Trafalgar Studios, London.
                     68) Breakfast at Tiffany's  How on earth do you follow Audrey Hepburn? Pop star Pixie Lott accepts the challenge, donning the dark glasses and swish gear to play the American geisha Holly Golightly in this musical version of Truman Capote's novella. It's been adapted by Richard Greenberg, who has returned to the book's 1943 setting, with a score by Grant Odling and direction by Nikolai Foster. MB 3-12 March, Curve, Leicester. Then touring.
                     69) The Painkiller  The latest instalment in the Kenneth Branagh season at the Garrick is Sean Foley's version, first seen at the Lyric Belfast in 2011, of a French farce by Francis Veber, who wrote Le DÓner de Cons. Rob Brydon plays a suicidal photographer and Branagh a thin-lipped hitman stuck in adjacent hotel rooms and finding their lives and identities hopelessly confused. Directing it himself, Foley should prove he knows his farce from his elbow. MB 5 March-30 April, Garrick, London.
                     70) Every One                                          Chris Goode, one of our most interesting theatre-makers, normally writes or devises his own work, but for the first time he is staging a script written by somebody else: the wonderful Scottish playwright Jo Clifford. The medieval morailty play Everyman becomes Everywoman, in a piece inspired by Clifford's experience of the death of her wife. Goode is always brilliant at teasing out the extraordinary in ordinary lives and this should be a very fruitful collaboration that explores the trauma of grief and the discovery of life amidst death, Angela Clerkin stars as the wife who drops dead in the middle of doing the ironing. LG 7-19 March, Battersea Arts Centre, London.
                     71) The Nap  You could hardly have a better match of play and venue than Richard Bean's new comedy-thriller and the home of the annual world snooker championship. Bean's hero is a Sheffield-born snooker star who finds himself being preyed on by his ex-con dad, local gangsters and a police corruption squad. Jack O'Connell, who won the rising star award at this year's Baftas, plays the lead, and Richard Wilson directs right on cue. MB 10-26 March, the Crucible, Sheffield.
                     72) Hamlet                     After the absurd hype about Benedict Cumberbatch, the news that the Royal Shakespeare Company is to cast a black actor as Hamlet has been received with a welcome lack of fuss. Paapa Essiedu has already played Romeo at Bristol's Tobacco Factory and was, by all accounts, excellent when he took over as Edmund in King Lear in mid-performance at the National. He now essays an even bigger challenge, but in Simon Godwin, who did a first-rate Two Gentlemen of Verona for the RSC, he has a strong director. MB 12 March-13 August, Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon.
                     73) People, Places and Things                     Denise Gough gives a shattering, career-defining performance in Duncan Macmillan's play, first seen at London's Dorfman in September. She plays a drink and drugs addict who checks into a rehab clinic, and combines helpless vulnerability and wilful obduracy. A great performance is aided by Jeremy Herrin's vivid production for Headlong and by sterling support from Barbara Marten and Nathaniel Martello-White. MB. 15 March-4 June, Wyndham's theatre, London.
                     74) I Am Thomas                     Who was the last person in Britain to be executed for blasphemy? It was Thomas Aikenhead, a loud-mouthed, free-thinking student in Edinburgh in 1697. He is the subject of this new play by Simon Armitage, a collaboration between Told By an Idiot, National Theatre of Scotland and the Royal Lyceum. It would be fascinating to see it paired with John Osborne's A Subject of Scandal and Concern about the last person in Britain to be prosecuted for blasphemy, in 1842. MB23 March-9 April, Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh.
                     75) X  There appears to be no end to Alistair McDowall 's imagination. The creepy and looping Pomona made McDowall one of the hottest playwrights around, and now he turns his attention to outer space. A crew on a research station on Pluto are having a particularly bad day at the office. They've lost contact with Earth and there is nothing for them to do but wait. Vicky Featherstone directs. LG 30 March-5 May, Royal Court, London. 

Dance
                     76) Akram Khan Company: Until the Lions                     Akram Khan's latest work has been created for the immersive space of the Roundhouse, and looks set to be one of his most spectacularly visual and theatrical productions. It represents a return to his roots - inspired by the Hindu epic Mahabharata, in which he first appeared as a child dancer, and rooted in the classical traditions of kathak, in which he trained. Khan leads a cast of three in telling the story of the princess Amba, who is abducted on her wedding day and invokes the gods to seek revenge. JM9-24 January, Roundhouse, London.
                     77) Mark Bruce Company: The Odyssey                     Mark Bruce's natural choreographic terrain is the dark and the epic, and after his award-winning version of Dracula, he turns to Homer's Odyssey. A free, time-travelling interpretation of the ancient myth, it moves from New York to Hades, from Mozart to Mark Lanegan, in telling the story of one man's confrontation with the gods and the elements. The cast is led by the very excellent Jonathan Goddard and Hannah Kidd. JM 4-6 February, Merlin theatre, Frome. Then touring to 28 April.
                     78) Royal Ballet: New Christopher Wheeldon                     This is the first dedicated programme evening that the Royal have given their associate choreographer. Its highlight is a new work set to music by Mark-Anthony Turnage, a semi-narrative piece inspired by the John Singer Sargent painting Madame X, which created a scandal for its subject, a famous society beauty. Also in the programme is Wheeldon's lush, lyrical setting of Essio Bosso's score Within the Golden Rain, and After the Rain set to music by Arvo P‰rt. JM In rep 12 February-11 March, Royal Opera House, London.
                     79) Bartabas: Golgota                      Bartabas, the horse whisperer of dance, returns to London with his latest production, which features his own remarkable equestrian art along with a cast of four horses, a donkey and contemporary flamenco dancer AndrÈs MarÌn. Bartabas is inspired by the power of ritual, and in this work evokes the ceremonies of religion and the stage, accompanied by live performances of the Gregorian motets by composer Tom·s Luis de Victoria. JM 14-21 March, Sadler's Wells, London.
                     80) Richard Alston Dance Company                     Alston's latest work, An Italian in Madrid, explores the migration of a dance language via kathak, flamenco and the rest of Europe, and features BBC Young Dancer finalist Vidya Patel. Also in the programme is the superb duet Mazur, created for Jonathan Goddard and Liam Riddick, and Martin Lawrance's new work Stronghold, set to the percussive rollercoaster of Julia Wolfe's score. JM29-30 March, Sadler's Wells, London. Then touring. 

Comedy
                     81) Robert Newman: The Brain Show                     No one does comedy quite like Robert Newman, the ex-Mary Whitehouse Experience rock'n'roll comic turned activist, novelist and cerebral mainstream refusenik. His shows are part comedy, part densely packed lectures on history, politics or, in this case, neuroscience, towards the grand claims of which our host takes a sceptical stance. The Brain Show also reportedly features a live brain-imaging electroencephalograph hat, providing a readout of Newman's mental state throughout the show. BL11-23 January, Soho theatre, London. Then touring.
                     82) Trygve Wakenshaw: Nautilus                     Mime and physical comedy have been hip in comedy circles for a few years now. But while Doctor Brown bagged an Edinburgh Comedy Award, it may yet be Trygve Wakenshaw who becomes the movement's breakout star. The New Zealander's 2014 show Kraken showcased his estimable mime talent, but there's more matter to its follow-up, and bigger laughs too. A silent comedy sketch show with animal rights undertones, it bagged Wakenshaw his own Comedy award nomination and a legion of swooning fans in Edinburgh. Now, a London International Mime festival run beckons. BL11-23 January, Soho theatre, London. Then touring.
                     83) Katherine Ryan: Kathbum  Joan Rivers is dead; long live Katherine Ryan, whose new show makes a brazen pitch for Rivers' mantle. She wears it well: her barbed celeb-gossip comedy elicits gasps and laughs in equal measure. I found the combination of that with Ryan's more personal material a little jarring on the show's Edinburgh debut but, having been toured through the autumn, it's likely to be purring nicely by now. Purring doesn't mean cuddly, mind: this cat's got claws. BL 14 January-11 March.
                     84) Isy Suttie: The Actual Tour                     After Bridget Christie blurred the lines between book launch and standup tour with A Book for Her last year, two equally fine comics follow suit this spring: Sara Pascoe with Animal (touring from May), and musical comic Isy Suttie from January. Suttie's coming-of-age memoir The Actual One chronicles the resistance she felt in her late 20s and early 30s to settling down. Onstage, the Peep Show star adds songs and standup to extracts from this literary debut. BL 17 January-19 February.
                     85) Rob Delaney  Until a couple of years ago, Rob Delaney was known in the UK - if at all - as that American comic who'd made a career out of mastering Twitter. Then came Catastrophe, the grown up rom-sitcom in which Delaney and Sharon Horgan get pregnant after a one (OK, several) night stand. Its success coincided with a real spike in the quality of Delaney's standup, if his last two UK shows are anything to go by. His last, at the Southbank Centre in 2015, was a masterclass in playfully amoral male sex comedy, and bodes mouthwateringly for a 2016 tour. BL 8 March-23 April. 

Books
                     86) Avenue of Mysteries by John Irving                     Juan Diego Guerrero, a middle-aged writer powered by Viagra and beta blockers, dreams about the fantastical Mexican childhood he shared with his psychic sister as "dump kids" raised by their prostitute mother beside a garbage heap. The realist longueurs of seniority are offset with magical realist memories of trapeze artists, draft dodgers, transvestites and dogs. CA14 January, Transworld.
                     87) The Noise of Time by Julian Barnes  A 37-year-old man waits all night by a lift in a Leningrad apartment block. So begins Barnes's first novel since his Man Booker-winning The Sense of an Ending - a meditation on art and power channelled through the story of Shostakovich's relationship with the Soviet state. Expect something short and intense, in the tradition that Barnes has been making his own. CA27 January, Jonathan Cape.
                     88) This is London: Life and Death in the World City by Ben Judah                     Turning his foreign correspondent's eye from Putin's Russia, the subject of his first book, to London, the reporter looks at how migration is transforming the city at all levels of society, from the oligarchs who are snapping up multimillion-pound new-builds to the refugees who make their home on the streets. CA28 January, Picador.
                     89) Gold Fame Citrus by Claire Vaye Watkins                     The latest despatch from planet apocalypse is this debut novel set in California, where the water has run out and all but the most intrepid citizens have decamped to refugee camps on the east coast of the US. Among the survivors on the Amargosa Dune Sea are starlet Baby Dunn, who has become the media's personification of climatic and social collapse, her ex-soldier boyfriend, and the sinister cult they encounter after they take on an abandoned child and set out in search of a more family-friendly life. CA4 February, Quercus.
                     90) Shylock Is My Name by Howard Jacobson  The series of 400th-anniversary Shakespeare reimaginings continues, with the Booker laureate Howard Jacobson squaring up to The Merchant of Venice. Jeanette Winterson opened the series with her version of The Winter's Tale. Margaret Atwood, Anne Tyler, Jo Nesb¯, Tracy Chevalier and Gillian Flynn are still to come. CA9 February, Hogarth Shakespeare.
                     91) Raptor: A Journey Through Birds by James Macdonald Lockhart                     No publishing year would be complete without a hymn to avian life. With the success of books such as Mark Cocker's Crow Country and Helen Macdonald's H is for Hawk, the literary birder is becoming a banker. The latest is an investigation of the 15 types of raptor that breed in the highlands and islands of UK, from hen harriers in Orkney to the sparrowhawks of Warwickshire. CA11 February, Fourth Estate.
                     92) Some Rain Must Fall by Karl Ove Knausgaard  There is something compulsively gripping about the completism of Karl Ove Knausgaard's My Struggle series of fictionalised memoirs. We've seen him grappling with childhood, adolescence and bleak young adulthood as a reluctant teacher on a remote island. But will interest hold up for this fifth volume, in which the Nordic navel-gazer begins to find his voice as a writer and circles back to the death of his dad where, one might argue, the whole journey began? CA 3 March, Harvill Secker.
                     93) The Lonely City: Adventures in the Art of Being Alone by Olivia Laing                     From a study of writers and alcohol to a meander along the river in which Virginia Woolf drowned, Olivia Laing's books have always taken her off the beaten paths. She's back with an exploration of loneliness inspired by her experience as an outsider in New York, where she kept company with the artworks that crowded the city's museums. CA3 March, Canongate.
                     94) Aeneid Book VI translated by Seamus Heaney                     For those left desolate by the death of the Irish Nobel laureate, there has been consolation in a trickle of posthumously discovered poems. This is the big one: his translation of the sixth book of Virgil's foundational epic, which follows Aeneid into the underworld. "The motifs in Book VI have been in my head for years," he told an interviewer. "The golden bough, Charon's barge, the quest to meet the shade of the father." A meeting of great minds on the far bank of the Styx. CA3 March, Faber. 

Pop
                     95) David Bowie - Blackstar                     Not quite as shrouded in secrecy as his 2013 comeback The Next Day, but infinitely more mysterious, Bowie's 25th studio album features jazz musicians playing rock, the challenging 2014 single Sue and the gorgeous, episodic title track, as heard on Sky Atlantic series The Last Panthers, which was apparently inspired, at least in part, by Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly. Early reviews in the monthly magazines appeared to be giving it one star, until it became apparent that this was Bowie's preferred typographical representation of the title. AP 8 January, Sony.
                     96) Tinashe: Joyride  The emerging US singer-songwriter, who experiments with past, present and future forms of R&B, returns with her second album, Joyride. Following a year of touring arenas on Nicki Minaj's Pinkprint tour and in South America with Katy Perry, the artist's minimal aesthetic - indebted to the quiet, cool calm of Aaliyah - has been beefed up for the follow-up to 2014's atmospheric Aquarius. HG 8 January, RCA.
                     97) The Libertines                     You could detect a distinct tone of surprise to the positive reviews that the Libertines' comeback album Anthems for Doomed Youth received, as if critics couldn't quite believe the band had managed to pull together such a good record. Their reunion rolls on with a tour around the country 's biggest venues, although how suited their ramshackle sound is to arenas remains to be seen.  AP 21-30 January.
                     98) Fat White Family: Songs for Our Mothers                     The refusenik Brixton collective continue their concerted push for mainstream success with their Sean Lennon co-produced second album, Songs for Our Mothers. Track titles include Lebensraum, Duce and When Shipman Decides: can Radio 1 possibly resist? Surely it's not long now until The X Factor finalists battle it out by each performing a cover version of Songs for Our Mothers' epic closer, Goodbye Goebbels! AP 22 January, Trashmouth.
                     99) Yoko Ono: Yes, I'm a Witch Too                     Yes, I'm a Witch Too is a follow-up of sorts to 2007's Yes, I'm a Witch, in which Ono once more underlines that her music, once reviled, has undergone a vast re-evaluation in recent years. This time she revisits her back catalogue in the company of hip names including Tune-Yards, Miike Snow, Death Cab for Cutie and Peter Bjorn and John, the latter taking on her 1971 single Mrs Lennon. AP22 January, Parlophone.
                     100) Savages: Adore Life  The postpunk foursome's second album, Adore Life, is more streamlined than its predecessor and less clunky. Live, they remain a fearsome proposition. They are, undeniably, a good thing: an unashamedly serious group, finding a growing audience despite a refusal to compromise - but there's still a slight suspicion that the songwriting doesn't yet quite match the rhetoric and presentation.  MH 22 January, Matador.
                     101) Massive Attack                     Writing about Dead, the debut album by Young Fathers, back in 2014, Alexis Petridis suggested that the group their genre-shirking style most closely resembled was Massive Attack. It makes sense, then, that the Bristolian trip-hop pioneers have invited the Scottish trio to open for them on their forthcoming UK tour, which, if the band are to be believed, will be followed by some new music later in the year. TJ 22 January-5 February.
                     102) Sia: This Is Acting                     This Is Acting, the seventh album by the Australian singer-songwriter - who is still perhaps better known as a blue-chip writer and producer by appointment to Kylie, BeyoncÈ, Rihanna and others than as a solo artist - is apparently more pop than her previous solo material. It's made up of songs written for other artists - including Adele, the co-author of Sia's single Alive - but never released by them. AP29 January, RCA.
                     103) NME Awards Tour                     Bloc Party headline this year's NME Awards tour, but it's traditionally the support acts who garner the most attention: a role filled over the years by the Arctic Monkeys, Franz Ferdinand, the Kaiser Chiefs and Florence + the Machine. This year, the bill features Drenge, the Essex rapper Ratboy and grime MC Bugzy Malone, whose debut EP confirmed the genre's commercial renaissance by making the Top 10. AP29 January-12 February.
                     104) Elton John  It features the same producer, T Bone Burnett , but from the title down, Wonderful Crazy Night - the first Elton John album in 10 years to reunite him with long-term sidemen Nigel Olsson and Davey Johnstone - is clearly envisioned as a distinct contrast to 2012's emotionally downcast, but critically acclaimed The Diving Board : a reminder of John's pop smarts. AP 5 February, Virgin EMI.
                     105) Foals  Like some of their best songs, Foals' career has owed much to the slow, steady build. The Oxford band began playing house parties in the mid-00s and have been filling ever bigger venues since, with five huge arena dates booked this February. If their recent warm-up tour - which saw them swan-diving from venue balconies in Liverpool one week, headlining a roller disco in Margate the next - is anything to go by, they won't have any problem stepping up. TJ12-20 February .
                     106) Jack Garratt: Phase  Since he was named as the winner of the new Brits critics' choice award and shortlisted for the BBC's sound of 2016 poll, the industry's gaze has been firmly and expectantly fixed on this Buckinghamshire-born singer and producer. Having sold out every headline show he's played in both the UK and US, the multi-instrumentalist has managed to reverse the public's perception of him since he lost in the UK heats of Junior Eurovision in 2005, and he offers an alternative to the earnest-singer-songwriter craze, making cavernous love songs full of melancholic pianos and restless electronics. HG 19 February, Island.
                     107) The 1975:                      I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware of It  The Cheshire quartet are an art-rock band in boyband's clothing, and their second LP - given the unwieldy title I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware of It - is a sprawling mass of music, from acoustic balladry to wobbly atmospherics to an electronic take on deep soul (gospel choir included). It's the album that will decide whether their future lies in stadiums or if they'll be staying in the theatres. Bet on the former. MH 26 February, Dirty Hit/Polydor.
                     108) Andrew Weatherall:                     Co                     venanza  The career of the man who might well be acid house's answer to Neil Young - and who has been doggedly pursuing his own wildly idiosyncratic path since 1988 - continues apace: his new album, Covenanza, features his long-term collaborator Nina Walsh, takes in chaotic post-punk, gentle morning-after electronica, trumpets and dubbed-out echo, and even an acoustic lament. AP 26 February, Rotter's Golf Club.
                     109) Adele  Adele hasn't performed live in Britain for almost five years. Should you be in need of a reminder of how far her career has skyrocketed since, it's worth noting that on her 2011 Adele Live tour, the first London date was at the 2,000-capacity Shepherd's Bush Empire. This time around, she's playing four consecutive nights at the 20,000-capacity O2 Arena. AP 29 February-5 April.
                     110) Loretta Lynn: Full Circle  Given the languid nature of her music, you'd hardly expect the country legend to rush back into the studio. Twelve years since the release of her 2004 collaboration with former White Stripes frontman Jack White, 83-year-old Lynn is set to return with a new album, Full Circle, recorded in Tennessee and produced by Patsy Lynn Russell and John Carter Cash. Expect Appalachian folk, country classics, a few new numbers and guest appearances from Willie Nelson and Elvis Costello. TM 4 March, Sony Legacy.
                     111) Jeff Buckley: You and I  During their preparations for a 20th-anniversary edition of Buckley's album Grace, Sony music unearthed the late singer's very first recording sessions for Columbia Records. Released as a new collection, You and I, it features nine cover versions (including tracks by the Smiths and Bob Dylan) and two originals: the first ever studio take of his album's centrepiece, Grace, and Dream of You and I, which is said to sound "mysterious and haunting". HG 11 March, Columbia/Legacy.
                     112) Country to Country festival                     The three-night event, happening simultaneously in London, Glasgow and Dublin, brings together an array of names reflecting country music's current commercial strength and critical acclaim. Eric Church has been gathering momentum since his clever, everyman-appealing single Springsteen, while a strong female contingent includes Miranda Lambert, Carrie Underwood and Kacey Musgraves, who has been winning hearts and minds with her gritty, witty takes on trailerpark life. MH11-13 March.
                     113) Bloc Weekend  Hasten to the glamorous surroundings of Butlins in Minehead for a three-day dance event that tends to the brainier end of the electronica spectrum: headliners include Four Tet, Detroit techno legend Jeff Mills and - hold tight ravers! - Thom Yorke of Radiohead, the latter playing a live set drawing on his party-starting solo albums The Eraser, Tomorrow's Modern Boxes, and Havin' It in Ibiza With Thom Yorke. AP 11-13 March.
                     114) Janet Jackson  You can only hope Jackson's first UK arena gigs since 2011 will dazzle audiences enough to move the conversation beyond her 2004 SuperBowl "wardrobe malfunction". The R&B-pop singer released her slick 11th album, Unbreakable, in October 2015, opting for low-key soul, pop and a touch of soft-rock. Touring this new material will give UK fans outside London and Dublin a chance to see her live for the first time in almost 18 years. TM 30 March-5 April. 

Classical
                     115) PellÈas et MÈlisande                                          Simon Rattle and the London Symphony Orchestra 's director Peter Sellars have created stunning versions of Bach's Passions in the last few years, in which Sellars's subtle directorial interventions turn concert hall spaces into places of living ritual. Can they do the same with Debussy's symbolist opera at the Barbican in London? With Rattle's orchestra-in-prospect, and a world-class cast - Gerald Finley, Magdelena Kozena, Christian Gerhaher among them - the omens look good.  TS9-10 January, Barbican, London.
                     116) Seven Stars Symphony                     A rare performance of an amazing score. Charles Koechlin's Seven Stars Symphony was inspired by his love affair with cinema in the early era of the talkies, when he saw new possibilities for the cinematic art form, and the music that it might inspire. But this is also a piece in which Koechlin consecrates his deep passion for the stars of the screen; it's a sequence of surreally heightened portraits in sound of Douglas Fairbanks, Marlene Dietrich, Greta Garbo (a pagan choral for ondes martenot) and, in the final movement, Charlie Chaplin. That tireless musical adventurer Ilan Volkov conducts the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra. TS 14 January, City Halls, Glasgow.
                     117) The Devil Inside                     Stuart MacRae's full-length opera, inspired by Robert Louis Stevenson's short story The Bottle Imp, is another collaboration with librettist Louise Welsh (they have worked together on two shorter operas for Scottish Opera in recent years). There are the makings of a real operatic thriller in Welsh's update of the story, as James uses the power of a bottle to change his apparently already perfect life for the even better, but actually for the much, much worse. MacRae's music, with its intense lyricism and sharp dramatic intuition, ought be the ideal medium to bring this supernatural drama to life. TS23 and 26 January, Theatre Royal, Glasgow ; 29-30 January, King's theatre, Edinburgh.
                     118) L'…toile                     The first time that Chabrier 's magnificently comedic confection of an opera has been staged at Covent Garden, and it receives a properly Gallic production from director Mariame ClÈment. It's an operetta of gossamer-light ridiculousness in its plot (an astrologically thwarted execution), but Chabrier subverts the expectations of his audiences and his players with music that's sumptuously, virtuosically refined. Mark Elder conducts, with a cast headed by Kate Lindsey in the trouser role of Lazuli, and Christophe Mortagne as King Ouf. TS1-24 February, Royal Opera House, London.
                     119) Louis Andriessen: Total Immersion  The BBC Symphony Orchestra devote a weekend to Louis Andriessen's music, starting with a UK premiere concert performance of his opera on Dante, La Commedia. Then there's a whole day of concerts, talks, and events that celebrate Andriessen's essential achievement in contemporary music: the composer who is still, at the age of 76, the signal inspiration for Dutch musical culture. The climactic concert, conducted by Clark Rundell, gives us two more UK premieres and a performance of a violently thrilling Andriessen classic, De Stijl, from his De Materie cycle. TS 9-13 February, Barbican, London.
                     120) Akhnaten  Phelim McDermott's new staging of Philip Glass 's operatic meditation on religious ideology and regime change in ancient Egypt - the first in London for 30 years - follows his inspired production of Glass's Satyagraha, also for ENO. Conducted by Glass specialist Karen Kamensek, it is a once-in-a-generation chance to hear Glass's score in the theatrical flesh, and with 500 tickets at each of the seven shows on sale for 20 quid or under, it's one to get in your diary now. TS 4-18 March, ENO, London.
                     121) Boris Godunov                     A new production from Richard Jones of Mussorgsky's epoch-making opera of power, corruption, politics and community is already a mouth-watering prospect. Added to which is a thrilling cast, headed by Bryn Terfel as Mussorgsky's guilt-wracked Tsar. Terfel's Boris should be one of the events of the operatic year, and with Antonio Pappano conducting, and the luxury casting of the other parts - John Tomlinson, Vlada Borovko, John Graham-Hall - the ROH's Boris Godunov is already one of the hottest tickets of 2016. TS14 March-5 April, Royal Opera House, London.
                     122) St Matthew Passion  John Eliot Gardiner returns to conduct a piece that has been at the centre of his musical life for decades, with his own Monteverdi Choir and English Baroque Soloists orchestra, the musicians with whom he seems to have a symbiotic and at times telepathic relationship. This European Eastertide tour, which comes to the Barbican in London at the end of March, should be the latest summation of Gardiner's lifelong Bach pilgrimage, and another umissable Bachian revelation. TS 26 March, Barbican, London.
                     123) The Ring Cycle  Complete performances of Opera North's four-year-long nationwide Ring project begin with two cycles in Leeds. The Ring has been an epic journey for the company, the singers, the orchestra and the director of the production, Peter Mumford. Performances of the individual operas over recent years have shown how effective Mumford's concept can be: it is somewhere between concert and full staging, but more convincing, many have felt, than either. The complete cycles should be overwhelming.  TS 23 April-21 May, Leeds Town Hall. Then touring until 10 July.
                     124) Pleasure  Mark Simpson's first opera is set in the toilets of the gay club Pleasure. It is a collaboration between Opera North, Aldeburgh Music and Royal Opera House, with his librettist Melanie Challenger (they worked together on Simpson's hugely successful oratorio The Immortal, for the Manchester international festival in 2015). Lesley Garrett's Val, Pleasure's toilet attendant, is the catalyst for a night of heightened, hedonistic, high-octane drama.  TS28-29 April, Howard Assembly Room, Leeds. Then touring until 15 May. 

Jazz, world and folk
                     125) Songs of Separation  The Scottish referendum has passed but the issues remain, and this project examines "what unites and divides us, personally, socially, spiritually and politically", by mixing new and traditional songs. Jenny Hill, who conceived it, is joined by nine other female singers from Scotland and England, including Eliza Carthy and Karine Polwart. RD On tour 21-24 January; album released 29 January on Navigator Records.
                     126) Rokia TraorÈ                     The most bravely experimental female singer in Africa returns with a new album and London concert. NÈ So is Rokia TraorÈ 's sixth album, and the follow-up to the much praised, rock-influenced Beautiful Africa three years ago. Backing is provided by guitars and n'goni, special guests include John Paul Jones and Devendra Banhart, and highlights include an exquisite treatment of Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit. RD 6 February, Roundhouse, London ; NÈ So released 12 February on Nonesuch Records.
                     127) Wynton Marsalis/Wayne Shorter/Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra  The 82-year-old saxophonist Wayne Shorter remains one of jazz's most revered and influential living artists, and trumpeter Wynton Marsalis is the most famous bandleader on the circuit, so a gig pairing the two is a momentous rarity. Marsalis and his Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra play new arrangements of compositions by one of jazz's most gifted melodists - but since Shorter is also still a sax improviser of startling unpredictability, the show will be far from a cosy reprise of his hits. JF18 February, Barbican, London.
                     128) The Gloaming                      The Gloaming have become an international phenomenon, thanks to their virtuoso blend of Irish traditional influences and experimentation. They release their second album, as yet untitled, on Real World Records on 26 February, when they play London's Union Chapel, followed by five concerts at the National Concert Hall in Dublin. Tickets are already on sale for their UK tour, which begins at the Colston Hall in Bristol on 21 September.  RD 26 February, Real World Records.
                     129) Tord Gustavsen  Tord Gustavsen, the Norwegian pianist whose fusion of low-key jazz and pensive gospel music has made him a hot ticket beyond the jazz loop, returns to the UK for seven March dates. He is still partnered by delicate drummer Jarle Vespestad, but a new departure is represented by Afghan-German vocalist Simin Tander, on a unique world-music repertoire joining Afghan and traditional Persian lyrics, Norwegian hymns and a little 50s American Beat poetry, from new album What Was Said. JF3-11 March.
                     130) Melody Gardot  The transformation of Melody Gardot from a singer of demure intimacies to raw and hard-rocking blues and gospel music has swelled this unique artist's global following. Gardot returns to Britain for the third time in a year with the powerful and often infectiously funky music from her new Currency of Man album, a rare brew of vocals that sometimes insinuatingly purr and sometimes blaze like Nina Simone, with a few jazzy instrumentals, and some pungent original songs about the condition of contemporary America. JF19 March, Palladium, London. 

Television
                     131) Deutschland 83  This eight-part German import has the feel of a Homeland for the Fatherland. At the height of the cold war in 1983, a young Stasi agent, Martin Rauch (Jonas Nay), is sent undercover into the West German army, charged with stealing Nato's nuclear secrets. Tension comes not only from the risk of Martin being discovered, but also from his superiors' increasing suspicion that the East German's impersonation of a "Wessi" might be becoming too convincing. Is he being turned by the hedonistic pleasures of Berlin's other half? ML Begins 3 January, Channel 4.
                     132) War and Peace                     The BBC's adaptation of Tolstoy's novel has already been so heavily publicised and trailed that it can sometimes feel as if it has already gone out. But this version by master adapter Andrew Davies really is finally almost here, with a cast resembling a United Nations summit of actors, including Paul Dano, Gillian Anderson, Jim Broadbent and Greta Scacchi. The drama is a key part of director general Tony Hall's policy of appeasing the BBC's political and media enemies with heavyweight heritage products - although some of them are already muttering that it's only in six parts, in contrast to the 20 of the 1972 version. ML Begins3 January, BBC1
                     133) Beowulf: Return to the Shieldlands  Few works of literature can have provided the basis for both a major volume by the Nobel-winning poet Seamus Heaney and a 12-part ITV drama, but such is the fate of the the oldest surviving Anglo Saxon poem, Beowulf. This version has no connection with Heaney but rather a lot to do with ITV's envious observation of the phenomenon of Game of Thrones. Warrior Beowulf (Kieran Bew) returns to his ancestral lands to encounter an impressive international credits list that includes Joanne Whalley and William Hurt. ML Begins 3 January, ITV.
                     134) Fresh Meat                     Just before Christmas, writers Sam Bain and Jesse Armstrong brought one much loved Channel 4 long-runner, Peep Show, to a close. Now, as New Year hangovers recede, they start the valedictory run of another: the student drama Fresh Meat - though fans will dream of some of the housemates, especially Zawe Ashton's Vod, Greg McHugh's Howard and Jack Whitehall's JP, possibly sharing a post-uni flat, Peep Show-style, in some future spin-off. The fourth and last Fresh Meat includes some classic Bain and Armstrong riffs and invective as Vod faces up to her accumulated overdraft and JP's brother arrives to mentor him in how to monetise his poshness in the world of work. ML Begins early 2016, Channel 4.
                     135) Jericho  ITV's search for a period piece to replace Downton Abbey has taken them to the late 19th century and the working class. In the Yorkshire Dales in 1870, the small community of Jericho is expanded by incomers hoping for work on the building of a new railway viaduct, or work providing food and lodging to those who do. Clarke Peters plays a railway agent and Jessica Raine a widower landlady. Writer Steve Thompson, a graduate of Doctor Who and Sherlock, has set up plots that seem to promise romance and dark secrets in the shadow of the Industrial Revolution. ML Begins 7 January, ITV.
                     136) Mr Selfridge  After three seasons exploring the rise of Harry Selfridge, Jeremy Piven is given the dramatically meaty material of the retail magnate's fall in this fourth and last series. There may be signs that Sir Lenworth Henry 's campaign for more diverse casting in TV drama is achieving some results, in the introduction of new cast members Sacha Dhawan as a rival entrepeneur, and Mimi Ndiweni as a new member of staff. ML Begins 8 January, ITV.
                     137) The Getaway Car                     After losing The Voice, BBC1 made noises that, in future, its Saturday night contest shows would be original creations rather than imported formats. This ambitious commission is an example, while also trying to park in the gap left by the Clarkson version of Top Gear. Couples representing a variety of lifestyles and generations (though presumably over 17) compete in driving challenges under the instruction of Dermot O'Leary, with the winners going bumper to bumper with Top Gear's The Stig. MLBegins 9 January, BBC1.
                     138) The Tracey Ullman Sketch Show                     After relocating to the US - where her sketch show won several Emmys and was famously the original home of The Simpsons - Ullman makes a series at the BBC for the first time in 30 years. UK viewers will be intrigued by how America and ageing have affected her material, and BBC accountants wouldn't object if she finds another Simpsons. MLBegins 10 January, BBC1.
                     139) Crashing                     Future historians of the UK housing market will find a useful source in TV fiction, which, having explored the mature flatshare (Peep Show) and adult children returning to live at home (Cuckoo) now comedy-dramatises the contemporary phenomenon of "property guardians", in which youngish people who can't afford housing pay peppercorn rents to live in unoccupied buildings to protect them from squatters. Writer-creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge also plays one of the characters looking after an unoccupied hospital.  MLBegins 11 January, Channel 4.
                     140) Stan Lee's Lucky Man                     It's a measure of the increasing competition among suppliers of drama that James Nesbitt's next big project after leading BBC1's The Missing is this Sky superhero series, which boasts the additional lure of coming from an artist with special powers of his own: 92-year-old Stan Lee, co-creator of Spider-Man, Iron Man and X-Men. The character he has imagined for Nesbitt is Harry Clayton, a London murder cop who picks up an ancient bracelet that gives him the ability to control luck. The test will be in how the writers, led by Neil Biswas, find ways of creating jeopardy for a protagonist with such a built-in advantage. MLJanuary, Sky One.
                     141) Better Call Saul  Having joined Frasier and George and Mildred among the tiny group of television spin-offs that have matched the impact of the original, this satellite franchise of Breaking Bad now faces the secondary challenge of equalling the success of its own opening series. The cleverness of the show is that it maintains the subversive tone of the original by replacing one professional apostate, a teacher who becomes a master criminal, with another: a lawyer who has little time for the law. Bob Odenkirk resumes his winning performance as title character Saul Goodman in episodes expected further to depress the New Mexico tourist board. ML February, Netflix.
                     142) The Last Leg Down Under  With their comedy talk show The Last Leg, Alex Brooker, Adam Hills and Josh Widdicombe radically changed the tone and profile of the treatment of disability on TV. In this documentary travelogue spin-off, they leave the studio for a tour of the Australian outback, guided by a blind travel agent. ML February, Channel 4.
                     143) Grayson Perry: All Man  Drama and reality have become so much the main currencies of the schedules that factual is at risk of being swamped. The form has a new star, though, in Grayson Perry. The Turner prize-winning artist has won Bafta awards for All in the Best Possible Taste and Who Are You? by creating a style that combines elements of documentary, chat-show and arts programmes, as he reports, talks and creates pieces inspired by his interviewees. His latest project tackles the subject - masculinity - of which he is a walking examination from the moment he looks in the wardrobe each morning. ML Spring 2016, Channel 4.
                     144) Line of Duty                     American TV bosses frequently express bemusement at how long it can take the Brits to get another season of a hit show on air. Paramedics may be required when they note the 24-month hiatus since the second series of Jed Mercurio's magnificent police series, but pedigree and rumour suggest that series three should be worth the wait. Vicky McClure and Adrian Dunbar are among the returning cast, as police internal affairs squad AC-12 investigates an armed response unit led by a new character, the dangerous Sgt Danny Waldron (Daniel Mays). ML Spring 2016, BBC2.
                     145) Happy Valley                     The assumption that hit dramas must have a second run has resulted in some duds (the reprises of Broadchurch and The Fall, for example), but Sally Wainwright is a good enough and busy enough writer to have been trusted not to return to Happy Valley unless she had unfinished business. Sarah Lancashire returns as single grandmother cop DS Catherine Cawood, this time on the trail of another serial killer in Yorkshire's Sylvia Plath country. Cath's previous near-nemesis Tommy Lee Royce (James Norton) features from jail, with new cast members including Shirley Henderson and the Croatian actor Ivana Basic. Moralists will be monitoring the hyper-realistic violence, but Wainwright has provocatively pledged "more comedy" this time. ML Spring 2016, BBC1.
                     146) The Tunnel: Sabotage  Originally an Anglo-French translation of the Danish-Swedish The Bridge, substituting the underwater Channel tunnel for the overwater Scandinavian crossing, The Tunnel returns with an original storyline by Ben Richards that begins with an aviation disaster suspected to be terrorism: a topical plotline that may become vulnerable to news events. Stephen Dillane and ClÈmence PoÈsy return as the international detectives. ML Sky Atlantic.
                     147) I Want My Wife Back  Writer-directors Mark Bussell and Justin Sbresni created for actor Ben Miller the brilliant sit-farce The Worst Week of My Life. The trio reunite for a comedy in which Miller is a man whose wife (Caroline Catz) walks out on him on her 40th birthday. The six parts follow his strategies to get her back and feature dismaying revelations about why she left. ML BBC1.

London takes just one week to breach annual air pollution limits; 
Parts of the capital have already breached EU hourly limits for nitrogen dioxide pollution which causes thousands of premature deaths each year.

Adam Vaughan.

London has already breached annual pollution limits just one week into 2016, and only weeks after the government published its plans to clean up the UK's air. 
At 7am on Friday, Putney High Street in West London breached annual limits for nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a toxic gas produced by diesel vehicles that has been linked to respiratory and heart problems.  
Under EU rules, sites are only allowed to breach hourly limits of NO2 18 times in a year, but this morning Putney broke that limit for the 19th time. Chelsea and Kensington is expected to do the same later today. 
Oxford Street has almost certainly also broken the limit already, having breached the hourly level a thousand times last year, but the monitoring station has malfunctioned. 
Campaigners said it was "breathtaking" the breach had come so early, though Oxford Street breached the annual limit in two days in 2015.
The UK has been in breach of EU pollution limits for five years now and last spring was ordered by the Supreme Court to publish an action plan on how to tackle the major health crisis. That plan was published in December, but London, Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool, Cardiff and Edinburgh and other major cities will still be in breach of NO2 limits for at least another five years, despite the measures.
Andrew Grieve, an air quality analyst at King's College London, which measures London's air pollution levels, said the early breach was not extraordinary looking at data from previous years.
"It's just [that] central London, and London as a whole, have a really huge problem with NO2. Breaching so early in the year really just illustrates how big a problem it is," he told the Guardian. He added that there were lots of similar roads to those that breached limits earlier but did not have monitors on them.
Campaigners and politicians blamed the government for the breach.
Alan Andrews, a lawyer for ClientEarth, an NGO which warned last month that the action plan was inadequate, said: "This is exactly why we are taking the government back to court. Its failure to deal with illegal levels of air pollution, which causes thousands of early deaths in London every year, is a scandal."
Simon Birkett, founder and director of Clean Air in London, said: "It is breathtaking that toxic air pollution in London has breached the legal limit for a whole year within a few days."
Labour MEP, Seb Dance, said the government should 'put up or shut up': "Receiving this dubious accolade has become a depressing annual event for London. NOx [which includes NO2] kills thousands of Londoners every year, but the government shows no inclination to take proper action.
"Tory Ministers say the right things, but in reality they have lobbied hard against ambitious new EU air quality targets and have let car manufacturers off the hook after the VW scandal. It's time for the UK government to put up or shut up."
A report commissioned by mayor Boris Johnson last year found that nearly 9,500 people die prematurely each year because of the capital's dirty air. A ultra low emissions zone is due to begin in 2020 in London to help tackle the problem.

Bafta nominations 2016: snubs for Courtenay and Rampling reawaken last year's Mr Turner outrage; 
While three big films slug it out for the largest haul, British talent is under-represented - with no recognition for 45 Years stars Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtenay.

Peter Bradshaw.

The Bafta nomination list reveals a three-way contest between big frontrunners: Steven Spielberg's cold war drama Bridge of Spies (which appears to have scored higher than in the Golden Globes), Todd Haynes's 1950s-set love story Carol and Alejandro Gonz·lez IÒ·rritu's tough survivalist thriller The Revenant. They have respectively nine, nine and eight nominations. They are three thoroughly excellent films, with enough inherent value to resist the cloying layers of award-prestige that settle at times like these.
However, as always, there are snubs and omissions which are exasperating: it is disappointing that no fully British film makes the actual best film category - the Baftas' outstanding British film list always has something of the "Commonwealth Games medal" feel - although the continued awards momentum for Carol will be highly gratifying for this film's British producers Stephen Woolley and Elizabeth Karlsen. And in fact The Danish Girl, Ex Machina and Brooklyn have all done well in the general tally. 
But it's excruciating that Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtenay, so superb in Andrew Haigh's marital crisis drama 45 Years, have been left off the best actress and best actor lists. Just as with Timothy Spall's non-appearance for Mr Turner last year, it seems Bafta has obtusely found a way to overlook world-class British acting talent - although Maggie Smith has rightly been noticed for her imperious performance in The Lady in the Van. To ignore Smith would be to trigger some kind of constitutional crisis. I would also have liked to see Carey Mulligan rewarded for her excellent but overlooked performance in Far From the Madding Crowd. 
Other big nominees that have crept up on us are Spotlight, Trumbo and The Big Short, three true-life stories from the US which have impressed Bafta voters even though these films have yet to be released in British cinemas. Trumbo is the story of Dalton Trumbo, the blacklisted screenwriter in the McCarthy era; Spotlight is about the Boston Globe's investigative reporters uncovering the scandal of a Catholic Church child abuse cover-up and The Big Short is an adaptation of Mike Lewis's book about the Wall Street mavericks who did well out of betting on the 2008 crash. These are movies which are admired for their high-mindedness and water-cooler talking-point qualities, although I have to say Spotlight is nowhere near as taut and tense as All the President's Men, to which it keeps getting compared.
And at the risk of being ungracious, I confess the continuing awards momentum and saucer-eyed reverence for Mad Max: Fury Road is slightly baffling, which gets seven nominations. I found it tremendously enjoyable, but as visually daring entertainment it is inferior to Inside Out and as action-thriller spectacle inferior to the new James Bond, Spectre, and to the outstanding new Star Wars offering. But something in its undoubtedly watchable craziness has struck a chord and Charlize Theron is always very good. 
As for best actress, if there is any justice it will go to Saoirse Ronan for her wonderful performance in Brooklyn: a luminous, subtle, effortlessly unshowy piece of work - although Brie Larson, Cate Blanchett, Alicia Vikander and Maggie Smith are all in their ways, worthy contenders. As far as the men go, this could be Leonardo DiCaprio 's year: he was tremendous in The Revenant, although Michael Fassbender 's more obviously polished and accomplished portrayal of Steve Jobs might pinch it. 
For adapted screenplay, I should like to see Phyllis Nagy win for her masterly version of Patricia Highsmith's original novel The Price of Salt, later renamed Carol. Quentin Tarantino should surely win best original screenplay for The Hateful Eight and again it is odd that Tarantino does not feature in the best director list. Ennio Morricone's fascinating score for The Hateful Eight has a well-merited nod.
                     Asif Kapadia's remarkable Amy, a passionate, intimate study of Amy Winehouse, quite rightly has nominations for documentary and best British film. I certainly wouldn't want to bet against him getting the first of these.
From the outstanding British debut nominations, the obvious frontrunner is Alex Garland's dazzlingly assured sci-fi thriller Ex Machina (which has four other nominations) with Alicia Vikander as the eerily self-aware AI-bot whose thoughts and feelings may be entirely genuine. Garland himself is hardly a newcomer to the industry having long established himself as a writer, but this debut as a director has had everyone talking since the film came out.
There is also Sean McAllister's A Syrian Love Story, his wrenchingly powerful study of Syrian refugees, and also The Survivalist by Stephen Fingleton, the much admired post-apocalyptic story set in Northern Ireland, slated for release later next month. Another very much admired but perhaps not very hyped movie on this nomination list is Naji Abu Nowar's Theeb, a classic action adventure set in the Middle East in 1916, in the manner of David Lean. (It also has a best foreign language film nomination.) There is also Debbie Tucker Green's tremendous lo-fi drama Second Coming, starring Idris Elba and Nadine Marshall, a mysterious yet convincing naturalist drama about what would happen to a couple when the woman appears to have become pregnant without sex. For what it's worth, it is my favourite from this particular nomination category.
So this Bafta list is the usual mix of unexceptionable tributes, obtuse omissions, and decent pats-on-the-back for underdogs. Right now I'm guessing Todd Haynes for best director, Bridge of Spies for best film with Saiorse Ronan and Leonardo DiCaprio up on stage for best actress and best actor.

My nerdy hero is the star of Making a Murderer; 
The appalling flaws in the US justice system are nothing new - the hit Netflix series shows attorney Dean Strang was raising the alarm 10 years ago.

Emma Brockes.

Like many people who have just binge-watched all 10 episodes of Making a Murderer, the extraordinary Netflix documentary about a man accused of a killing in small-town Wisconsin, I have become mildly obsessed with attorney Dean Strang. He acted as defence counsel for Steven Avery, the man who many believe was falsely convicted of murdering Teresa Halbach in 2005 and is serving a life sentence without parole.
In the 10-year-old trial footage Strang appears, floppy-haired and nerdy, as the voice of reason in a landscape peopled almost entirely by characters who seem to have stepped out of a Coen brothers movie. Strang's incredulity at the flaws in the US justice system, his flights of eloquence and shocked reaction to Manitowoc county law enforcement's more questionable tactics make him the hero of the piece and a rare corrective to the image of the slimy trial lawyer. At the end of the documentary he says of his client, "I just hope he is guilty." Because if he isn't, the implications are too awful. 
 Related:  Making a Murderer: another blow to our confidence in America's police
Strang still works as a defence lawyer in Madison, Wisconsin, and is an adjunct law professor at the university there. He has been in the media a lot in the US this week and it has been striking how unsuited he is to daytime TV - he is altogether too sober and mumbly. Neither does he fit the mould of rock-star lawyer, the byproduct of permitting TV cameras into the US court system that has thrown up, over the years, the likes of Gloria Allred and OJ's representative Johnnie Cochran.
In the Avery case, it wasn't hard for Strang to look good when the opposing counsel, Ken Kratz, came across as less of a lawyer than a circus ringmaster, staging absurdly theatrical press conferences and later resigning as district attorney after a sexting scandal. Nonetheless, Strang is so articulate, with such quiet, understated integrity that, by the end of the series, he too seems like a character from fiction.
"It's been a lot," he said mildly, of the huge response to the series. Here's hoping no one gives him a makeover.

No one does it like Coward
I streamed a lot of music over Christmas, in the course of which I happened across an album called NoÎl Coward at Las Vegas. (The "at" in this sentence is such a perfect assertion of English over American idiom that one imagines it came from Coward himself.) It was recorded in 1955 at the Desert Inn and features his most famous hits, including a rendition of Cole Porter's Let's Do It. At the end of the song, Coward changed the lyrics to appeal to the local audience, so he sang, "teenagers squeezed into jeans do it" and "even Liberace we assume does it" - a dangerous reference given that, a few years later, Liberace would successfully sue the Daily Mirror for implying he was homosexual. More often forgotten is the fact that Porter's original lyrics were far more offensive. "Chinks do it, Japs do it," sang Porter in the original, lines that were swiftly excised. The familiar "birds/bees" configuration sits more easily.
                                            My male cleaner                                        
Is your vacuum cleaner male or female? I ask because I realise I have been referring to my Roomba as male. (He managed to shut himself in the bathroom last week and battered hysterically against the door until I let him out.) The car is a she, so is the GPS, although that is by design. Most computer voices are female, except in Germany, where BMW, reportedly recalled the voice system on the 5 Series after hundreds of German men complained they wouldn't take directions from a woman. The male vacuum cleaner feels like a rebuke to all this, particularly when a friend says hers is definitely female because, after all, "who else is going to do the cleaning?"

Protests at Trump rally and Obama speaks out on guns - as it happened; 
The GOP frontrunner hosted a rally in Burlington, Vermont, among Sanders faithful, while the president took part in a live townhall to discuss gun control.

block-time published-time 2.21am GMT 
 Obama and Trump's events have both finished.  
 The difference in style could not have been more stark.  
At Trump's rally in Bernie Sanders' hometown of Burlington, Vermont, protesters were thrown out en masse - and people who did not swear allegiance to Trump were not allowed in. A bombastic Trump said that gun free zones in schools were "bait" for "sickos." Outside, a large crowd of protesters gathered, chanting Bernie Sanders' name.
At the same time, president Obama held a townhall meeting on CNN to discuss gun violence with a range of audience questions from people across the spectrum, from a rape victim who wanted to be reassured that she would still be able to protect herself, to a sheriff who wanted to know if he would be able to enforce the law, to Mark Kelly, the husband of Gabrielle Giffords, the representative who was shot in Arizona in a mass shooting attack. 
The president's cool demeanor frayed only once; when challenged over his use of the term "conspiracy" over whether his government wanted to take people's guns from them en masse. "Yes! I think it's fair to call it a conspiracy [theory]!" he said. 
Earlier in the day he wrote an op-ed in the New York Times pledging not to support or campaign for any candidate who did not support gun control legislation.
block-time published-time 2.13am GMT 
 Obama has finished his townhall  
"Some of the proposals I'm making mightnot be as effective as others," he says. 
"But let's not assume every few weeks there's a mass shooting; every few months there's one that gets national publicity; every day people get shot on the streets and nobody hears about it."
 "We can do better, if we come together," he ends. 
block-time published-time 2.09am GMT 
Tre Bosley, whose brother Terrell was shot and killed 10 years ago, says he's lost "countless friends and family members" to gun violence. "Most of us aren't thinking of our life on a long term scale. Most of us are thinking minute-to-minute." He asks what advice the president has for him.
"You know - when I see you, I think about my own youth," Obama says. "I probably wasn't that different from you. But I lived in a more forgiving environment. If I screwed up, there wasn't much risk of being shot."
 He pauses. "And - that's how all kids should grow up. Wherever they live." 
block-time published-time 2.05am GMT 
Cooper asks about Obama's New York Times pledge not to support any candidate who does not support gun control reform.
"The majority of people in this country are a lot more sensible than those in Washington," he says. "And the reason Washington doesn't work well, is the loudest, shrillest voices, the least compromising, the most powerful, or those with the most money have the most influence." 
The way Washington changes is when people vote. The way we break the deadlock on this issue is when... the NRA doesn't have a stranglehold on congress.
block-time published-time 2.02am GMT 
Mark Kelly, the astronaut husband of rep. Gabby Giffords, who was shot in a mass shooting event in Arizona, asks "with 350m guns, if the federal govt wanted to confiscate those objects, how would they do that."
"First of all, every time I see Gabby, I'm thrilled, because I visited her in the hospital," Obama says. "As we left the hospital to go to a memorial service, we had word that she opened her eyes for the first time." Giffords is here too.
Obama says mistrust of the federal government "is in our DNA." He calls it a conspiracy - which Cooper disputes. For the first time, Obama seems visibly angry. "Yes! I think it's fair to call it a conspiracy [theory]!" 
"It's a false notion circulated with political intent, which prevents us coming together to make us safer. The notion that we can't agree on some things while not agreeing on others, and the notion is, well, the president secretly wants to do x - would mean that we'd be paralysed on everything."

 "There are conspiracy theories floating around the internet all the time," Obama says.  He points to Jade Helm, the training exercise in Texas. "People were convinced it was the start of martial law."
Then, he starts talking about smart gun technologies - weapons that only work if the wearer of a certain bracelet has their hand on the trigger. He says manufacturers backed off their development after pressure from the NRA. "That doesn't make sense to me. I would think people would want the choice," he says. "It has not been developed primarily because it has been blocked by the NRA. So what we proposed was, we'll do some of the research, and then give everybody a choice, because I think there will in fact be a market for that."

   Obama tears up during gun control speech  
Speaking to Cooper, Obama says that when he visited Newtown two days after the attack, that was the only time he'd ever seen Secret Service members cry on duty.
"As I enter into my last year as president, I could not be prouder of the work that we've done, but it also makes me really humble. A lot of the work you do is just to incrementally make things better," he says, speaking with unusual candor.
Whenever he talks about the "mischaracterisation" of his views on the subject, his frustration is palpable.

"Do you think a good guy with a gun can be a bulwark against a bad guy with a gun," Cooper asks. Throws the question to Kimberly Corban, a rape survivor, who says that being able to buy a firearm is "a basic responsibility as a parent at this point."
"First of all, obviously, your story is horrific," Obama says. He praises her strength in telling it. "I just want to repeat that there's nothing we've proposed that would make it harder for you to get a firearm."
"There really is nothing we're proposing that makes it harder for you to purchase a firearm if you need one."
"There are always questions about whether or not having a firearm in the home protects you from that kind of violence," he adds. "I'm not sure we're going to be able to resolve it."

 The first question for President Obama comes from Taya Kyle, the widow of Chris Kyle, on whom the book American Sniper was based. She worries that the laws will not be followed by the murderers. "Would it be a better use of our time to give people hope in a different way?" She says that America is at an all-time low for murder rate.
Obama says that the low violent crime rate "is not something that we celebrate enough... most cities are much safer than they were." He disputes the idea that the reason for that is high gun ownership, saying that the places with higher gun ownership are often places where the violent crime rate hasn't dropped as much.
But, he tells Taya, "you will still be able to buy a firearm."

"We're trying to do something modest, and the response is that we're trying to take away everybody's guns," Obama says. He says his position has been "mischaracterised." 
He laments the NRA's lack of attendance. "We have invited them repeatedly, but if you listen to the rhetoric, it is so over the top - and not acknowledging the fact that there is no other consumer item we purchase... theres nothing else in our lives that we purchase that we don't try to make it a little safer if we can." He points to the fact that traffic fatalities have reduced drastically in his lifetime. 
"The notion that we would not apply the same basic principles to gun ownership... or the notion that everything we do is somehow a plot to take away guns, that contradicts what we do to try to create a better life for Americans in any other area of life."
He says he's happy to meet with the NRA, but "the conversation has to be based on truth."

Now the president is talking about his executive action on Tuesday to shrink the private sale loophole. "We want to put everybody on notice that the def of doing bus - which means you have to run a background check - is if you are making a profit and selling multiple guns." 
Cooper points out that this is, perhaps, not specific enough. 
"Ultimately, it's up to Congress to set up a system that is efficient," Obama says. "The fact that the system may not catch every single person," he says, is outweighed by the fact that it could save lives.

 Back to Obama.  "I respect the Second Amendment, I respect the right to bear arms. I respect sportsmanship," he says. "...but when you're losing 30,000 people to firearms, two thirds of them suicides..."
He says he wants to combine gun safety with sensible background checks. "If we can take that 30,000 to, say, 28,000, that's two thousand families who don't have to go through what the families of Newtown had to go through," he says.

"Have you ever owned a gun?" Cooper asks the president. "I have never owned a gun," Obama replies. 
He says that other than hunting for wild pig in Hawaii, where he grew up, there isn't the culture of hunting and sportsmanship that there is in other parts of the country.
Asked whether he's coming for people's guns, Obama points out that gun sales have gone up during his seven years of presidency. "I've been good for gun manufacturers," he says, a little bitterly.

 Obama takes the stage for gun control townhall  
The president is taking part in a live townhall meeting organised by CNN and moderated by Anderson Cooper, to discuss gun control.
Earlier today, he wrote an op-ed in the New York Times to say that he would not "campaign for, vote for or support any candidate, even in my own party, who does not support common-sense gun reform."
Cooper said that "one voice you won't hear from tonight is the National Rifle Association," saying that the organisation was asked to attend but declined.

Great story from Danny Yadron on a White House mission to enlist the help of Silicon Valley in 'disrupting' radicalism.
 The White House will attempt to enlist Silicon Valley's major technology firms in its efforts to combat terrorism on Friday when a delegation of the most senior intelligence officials fly to California to meet with executives from companies including Facebook, Twitter, Apple, Microsoft, YouTube and others. 
A copy of the agenda seen by the Guardian indicates the White House seeks more or less to channel Silicon Valley's talent into its war against Islamic State and other extremist groups. 
It states: "In what ways can we use technology to help disrupt paths to radicalization to violence, identify recruitment patterns, and provide metrics to help measure our efforts to counter radicalization to violence?"
The delegation will be led by White House chief of staff Denis McDonough, and include NSA chair Admiral Mike Rogers and James Clapper, the director of national intelligence.

President Obama has written an op-ed in the New York Times about gun violence, in the wake of his executive actions on Tuesday.
Key to the article is a pledge not to "campaign for, vote for or support any candidate, even in my own party, who does not support common-sense gun reform."
 Thanks to the gun lobby's decades of efforts, Congress has blocked our consumer products safety experts from being able to require that firearms have even the most basic safety measures. They've made it harder for the government's public health experts to conduct research on gun violence. They've guaranteed that manufacturers enjoy virtual immunity from lawsuits, which means that they can sell lethal products and rarely face consequences. As parents, we wouldn't put up with this if we were talking about faulty car seats. Why should we tolerate it for products - guns - that kill so many children each year?

 Trump campaign "manhandles" Bernie supporters  
The Trump campaign has kept at least two Bernie Sanders supporters from attending the rally in Burlington and "manhandled" them in the process.
Tim Farr of Burlington had waited in line since 10 AM to see Trump's appearance in his hometown. The well spoken young man was wearing a Bernie Sanders pin as was his mother. As they entered the auditorium, Farr told the Guardian that he and his mother were grabbed by Trump's security and "forcibly ejected from the building." 
Despite having a ticket to the event, Farr was told "this is a private event, only Trump supporters are allowed in." 
He said he and his mother were grabbed before they could say anything. Even though they tried to insist "we weren't here to protest, just here to see Donald Trump." It didn't matter. Farr said "we were wearing this [Bernie Sanders] pin and we were the enemy." 
Farr thought this was not "Vermont values," and never experienced anything like it before his life. He said mournfully "Bernie would allow Trump supporters in his evens." Farr stayed outside the rally to protest in frustration. However, his mother went home in tears.
He also told the Guardian that he was still considering whether or not to file a police report for simple assault.
The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

enltrEvery Democrat in the race would be good for women - but @HillaryClinton stands well above the rest. https://t.co/XN6z7Ti7CO#PPact4Hillary

She continued:
There has never been a more important election when it comes to women's health and reproductive rights-and Planned Parenthood's patients, providers, and advocates across the country are a crucial line of defense against the dangerous agenda being advanced by every Republican candidate for president.
This week was a jarring reminder of what's at stake in 2016. For the first time ever, the United States House and Senate passed a bill to defund Planned Parenthood and repeal the Affordable Care Act. Thankfully, President Obama will exercise his veto power to stop the Republicans from cutting off women, men, and young people from vital health care services at Planned Parenthood-including cancer screenings, well-woman exams, and STI and HIV tests-and taking away health coverage from 18 million people. Any of the Republican candidates will proudly sign that bill into law if they win. We can't let that happen.

In fact, he wouldn't be the first to observe the strange phenomenon of Trump/Sanders support crossover.

Hot Air chalks it up to the "blue collar coalition" both candidates are developing; moreover, Sanders has in the past publicly appealed to Trump supporters to back him instead, and even instructed his canvassers with specific scripts to lure Trump supporters.

 Hillary Clinton has had it with your selfie sticks. 
In an interview with Esquire Magazine, the Democratic frontrunner decried "the tyranny of the selfie" as hampering her ability to connect with voters in real life, as opposed to just their Instagram feeds.
It used to be - and I was talking to President Obama about this the other day - it used to be that you would do an event like this and then you would shake hands with people and they would talk to you. They would say, 'I liked what you said about this' or 'You didn't mention that' or 'Can I tell you this?' And it was a constant learning and absorbing experience.
Now, it's just 'Can I take a selfie? Can I take a picture?' People just want to capture that moment, and I just try to be accommodating.
Clinton isn't so distressed by the ubiquity of camera phones that she won't oblige requests for a close-up, however - when told that she has a skill for taking artful selfies, the former secretary of state said, "That's what people ask for.

Navy ship fundraiser furore: 'much ado about nothing' says Nationals MP; 
Paul Brown, who tried to sell $1,000 tickets to a political event aboard HMAS Perth, is far from the first politician to try to associate himself with the military.

Daniel Hurst Political correspondent.

An attempt to use a navy warship for a party fundraiser "beggars belief" but continues a long trend of MPs trying to associate themselves with the military for political purposes, former defence figures have said.
The Western Australian Nationals MP Paul Brown, who tried to sell $1,000 tickets to a political fundraiser aboard HMAS Perth, dismissed the scandal as "much ado about nothing".
 Related:  WA Nationals cancel fundraiser on navy warship, blaming 'internal excitement' 
The event has been cancelled but defence figures and politicians from across the political spectrum have expressed outrage the idea was even contemplated. The defence minister, Marise Payne, and the navy said they were not told about the nature of the event.
Labor has formally written to Payne asking her to clarify whether her office, the Department of Defence or the defence forces had any knowledge or involvement in the fundraiser.
"It is fundamental to our democratic system that the Australian defence force remains politically neutral and that every effort is made to avoid its politicisation," acting defence spokeswoman Gai Brodtmann said. 
"The fundraising event that was planned by the Nationals WA was directly contrary to this principle and utterly inappropriate." 
Executive director of the Australian Defence Association, Neil James, said Brown's public comments indicated he was "still in denial".
"How could any elected politician in Australia for a moment think that such an activity was appropriate? It just beggars belief," James said.
It was always wrong, he said, for politicians to try "hijack the public respect the defence force has for electoral purposes" and he saw the attempted fundraiser as part of a long-term trend.
"How often have you seen politicians from both sides of politics want to officiate at a deployment or welcome home for a defence force contingent?" James asked.
"You had the last defence white paper announced at a military base with a whole lot of soldiers, sailors and airmen standing behind as props. How often do you see politicians in their electoral brochures in lots of photos with people in uniform?"
The latest episode began after Brown purchased a package - which included a tour of HMAS Perth, the use of a flight simulator and a group lunch - at a Royal Flying Doctor Service fundraising event. 
Brown then tried to turn this into a political fundraiser, sending out invitations offering $1,000 per person tickets to "a unique luncheon experience with the Nationals WA leadership on-board the Australian navy warship, HMAS Perth" on 15 January. 
The promotion carried the banner "All aboard!" and promised access to the National party's state leader, Terry Redman, the deputy leader, Mia Davies, and the state director, Jamie Forsyth.
Brown said when he, Redman and Davies discussed the event at a meeting on Monday, they decided to call it off because it "might be less than appropriate".
"It's all really a much ado about nothing," Brown told ABC on Friday. "We'd only made... an invitation to a minor group of supporters and we cancelled the event well in advance before it became a political football."
Brown said he was now planning to invite constituents with disabilities to a future luncheon on the HMAS Perth without charging anyone to attend.
State and federal Labor MPs demanded an explanation about the approval process for the fundraiser, prompting Payne to say her office had no knowledge of the event. 
"I am advised that Navy was not informed that the event, which was originally auctioned to raise money for the Royal Flying Doctor Service, was being billed as a political fundraiser," the defence minister said on Thursday.
"Defence facilities should not be used for political fundraising purposes and it is regrettable that the original invitation was issued."
In 2014, Labor raised concern about a Liberal party banner being used as a backdrop for a press conference on RAAF Base Edinburgh in Adelaide by the then prime minister Tony Abbott and the South Australian party leader, Steven Marshall, two days before the state election.

The left must admit the truth about the assaults on women in Cologne; 
When the rights of women and a warm reception for migrants come into conflict, it's understandable if the left panics - but we have to salvage nuance.

Deborah Orr.

Oh dear. It's leftageddon. Two matters close to the progressive heart have been pitted against each other. In one corner, the right of women to stroll down the street, wearing what we like to wear without being mistaken for a walking, gilt-edged invitation to cop a free feel. In the other, the right of men, women and children to flee war, oppression and privation to seek refuge in other countries, without being seen as a swarm of subhuman parasites who will destroy any naive host who welcomes them. Tricky.
News of events in Cologne on New Year's Eve filtered out slowly, but it has become glaringly obvious that during celebrations in that city - and, to a lesser extent, other German cities - many women were targeted by gangs of men who surrounded them and subjected them to sexual assaults. The women, and witnesses, say that their attackers seemed to be from the Middle East or north Africa. Critics of Germany's open-door refugee policy say they warned us. Nightmare.

Short of going full conspiracy-theory, and suggesting a) that rightwing German men have slapped on the fake tan in a fiendish effort to engineer a revolt against German immigration policy; or b) that rightwing German men have slapped on the fake tan and dresses, then made it all up, to the same end, there appear to be few uncomplicated ways to blame the right for all this.
I'm not counting the argument that says there is no hard evidence that these were refugees, because - let's face it - it's silly to pretend that the word "refugee" is synonymous with the word "saint" anyway.
Only a simpleton - or, more commonly, person driven by instinct and emotion - thinks you can counter the uncompromising prejudice of "all immigrants are bad" with the uncompromising prejudice of "all immigrants are good". The debate is worth having because the story has presented itself to us, whether the story is true or not. It will keep on presenting itself, in some form or another, until we can achieve some measure of agreement over what the story means.
The stereotypical right tends to blame the stereotypical left for all its woes in an uncomplicated way. The stereotypical left tends to respond with similar clod-hopping generalisation. But the hopeful columnist can still believe it possible to salvage some nuance; perhaps even, heaven forfend, some useful and solid points on which both left and right can agree.
First, these were opportunistic, organised crimes. The fact that they were carried out in the open, in front of many witnesses, suggests that the perpetrators were pretty sure they would get away with it. Sexual criminals who get away with things tend to become more ambitious. There's no denying that this is a serious problem.
Second, the perpetrators seem to have been absolutely correct in their certainty that they would get away with their crimes. The police were slow to respond to reports of sexual assaults, slow to admit to an emerging pattern of assault - or maybe even to piece one together at all - and say now that they are unlikely to be able to apprehend or convict any of these brazen serial sexual predators. So they have insight into European culture, even if it's negative insight.
Third, however, refugees are most certainly not responsible for a general criminal-justice climate that struggles to treat sexual crime with the seriousness and urgency it warrants. Shoulder-shrugging and victim-blaming when women are sexually molested is hardly an alien new thing that could only have reached Europe because it has been nefariously smuggled in from abroad.
Fourth, common-or-garden reluctance to take seriously complaints from women about sexual assault is unlikely fully to explain the reluctance with which this scandal has been revealed to the public. Worries about stirring up racial bigotry were surely a factor, too. Quite obviously, such concerns were not unfounded. But trying to ignore or suppress politically unwelcome news is always a bad idea. Plus, it's possible that the perpetrators understood, too, that a febrile, populist political climate could be exploited to their own advantage.
Fifth, how could anyone possibly imagine that among a million people from anywhere there wouldn't be some proportion of nasty, sleazy misogynists? A British legal history that includes the withholding of all manner of basic rights from women suggests that there's nothing racially or religiously inherent in chauvinism. People tend to believe what they're taught to believe, and the unreliable evidence of what they see around them, until free thinkers and visionary leaders call them out on it. 
Sixth, it is beyond doubt that there are people living in Europe now who have been brought up in a culture where a woman would be publicly and viciously punished for allowing herself to be the victim of a sexual assault. It is utterly unrealistic to expect all those brought up in fundamentalist religious cultures - conservative Islam being the largest, but by no means the only such culture - to be able suddenly and completely to ditch all aspects of the pervasive environment they were brought up in.

Men who have been raised to believe that only a worthless woman walks through the street alone - even when her head and body are covered - only come to an understanding that this is not the case through consistent intellectual effort. There's no excuse for not making this effort. But the fact is this: some people will heavily resist it. That, too, is human.
Consistent intellectual effort needs leadership. Unfortunately, help with such effort from secular and religious leaders in the Middle East and north Africa seems to be in very short supply. In Europe, the leader who both champions and embodies such efforts far better than anyone else is Angela Merkel. It's sad that folk are willing to seize on the tawdry, cowardly actions of a bunch of destructive, selfish, dangerous sexual abusers to disparage and traduce her bravery, optimism and humanity. Merkel is the one to take guidance and inspiration from, not them.

'Let the voters judge': Hillary Clinton dismisses Trump attacks against Bill; 
Democratic frontrunner says Republicans trying to uncover a scandal in her family 'didn't work before, won't work again'.

Alan Yuhas in New York.

Hillary Clinton on Sunday dismissed Donald Trump's disparagement of her husband, the former president Bill Clinton, saying the personal attacks "didn't work before, won't work again".

                     The Democratic frontrunner for president said Republicans had repeatedly tried to uncover a scandal in her family, alluding to her husband's admitted affair and the inquiries into her handling of a personal email server and a 2012 attack in Benghazi  while she was secretary of state. 
 "If [Trump] wants to engage in personal attacks from the past, that is his prerogative," she said in an interview on CBS's Face the Nation. "You know, so be it."
Trump, who is leading Republican polls around most of the country, has responded to the former president's presence on the campaign trail by recalling questions about him and other women. On Sunday Trump called the former president "an abuser", during an interview on NBC's Meet the Press.
 "A woman claimed rape, and all sorts of things," Trump said. "I mean, horrible things." 
Himself twice divorced, Trump said his own marital dramas did not compare to those of the Clinton family. 
Trump said: "You know what? I wasn't president of the United States. And I wasn't dealing in the Oval Office, all right? A big difference. I wasn't the president."
Last July, Trump distanced himself from comments by his lawyer and spokesman Michael Cohen, who threatened a reporter from the Daily Beast who had resurrected allegations from the late 1980s that Trump had raped his then wife, Ivana.
Ivana subsequently said the Daily Beast story was "entirely without merit".
On Sunday, Clinton refused to engage. "It has been fair game going back to the Republicans for some years," she said, of her husband's past. "He can say whatever he wants about me. Let the voters judge that.
"I think it's a dead end, blind alley for them. But I am not going to let him or any of the other Republicans rip away the progress that we have [made]. It has been too hard-fought-for. And I am going to stand up and make it clear there is a huge difference between us."
The former secretary of state also used the interview to draw distinctions between herself and her closest Democratic rival, Bernie Sanders. She criticized the Vermont senator for voting against some gun control legislation in Congress, and in particular for voting for a law that protects gun makers from lawsuits.
"I think he has been consistently refusing to say that he would vote to repeal this absolute immunity from any kind of responsibly or liability," she said.
Sanders has said he has reconsidered those votes and now supports stronger gun control measures.

In Iowa on Friday, the senator responded to a question about the Clinton family's history. He rebuked Trump and the former president, but not his presidential rival.
"Hillary Clinton is not Bill Clinton," Sanders told the crowd. "But what Bill Clinton did was totally, totally, totally disgraceful and unacceptable. But I am running against Hillary Clinton, not Bill Clinton."
He added: "What we need to do as a nation, certainly something the Republicans are not doing, is focus on the bloody issues facing this country - the disappearance of the middle-class income and wealth inequality."
The former president himself, also campaigning in Iowa, said he had "no interest in getting involved" or "doing anything except working to help Hillary". 
Asked directly about the billionaire's scorn, he said: "Donald Trump says a lot of things."

The white man pathology; 
On an American road trip, Stephen Marche enters the fray with Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders in Iowa and gets a view of the campaign trail from the perspective of his whiteness.

Stephen Marche.

The border
You feel your whiteness properly at the American border. Most of the time being white is an absence of problems. The police don't bother you so you don't notice the police not bothering you. You get the job so you don't notice not getting it. Your children are not confused with criminals. I live in downtown Toronto, in one of the most liberal neighborhoods in one of the most open cities in the world, where multiculturalism is the dominant civic value and the inert virtue of tolerance is the most prominent inheritance of the British empire, so if you squint you can pretend the ancient categories are dissipating into a haze of enlightenment and intermarriage.
Not at the border.
My son's Guyanese-Canadian teacher and the Muslim Milton scholar I went to high school with and the Sikh writer I squabble about Harold Innis with and my Ishmaeli accountant, we can all be good little Torontonians of the middle class, deflecting the differences we have been trained to respect. But in a car in the carbon monoxide-infused queue waiting to enter Detroit, their beings diverge drastically from mine. 
I am white. They are not. They are vulnerable. I am not.
Here's the thing: I like the guards at the American border. They're always friendly with me, decent, even enjoyable company. At the booth in between the never-was of Windsor and the has-been of Detroit, the officer I happened to draw had a gruff belly and the mysterious air of intentional inscrutability, like a troll under a bridge in a fairytale.
 "Where are you headed?" he asked.
 "Burlington, Iowa."
 "Why would anyone ever choose to go to Burlington, Iowa?" he asked philosophically. 
 "I'm going to see Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders." Then, because it did seem to require an explanation: "They're giving rallies within a couple of days of each other."
 "Why would anyone ever choose to go see Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders?"
I didn't argue, because it was the border, but I could have said that the police chief of Birmingham estimated that 30,000 people showed up in Alabama to see Donald Trump in August and that in Dallas, he had filled the American Airlines Center, and that his counterpart, Bernie Sanders, has generated equally unprecedented numbers - vastly more than Barack Obama drew at comparable moments in the 2008 campaign.
 "I'm curious," I said instead.
At this point he asked me to roll down my window. But it was all fine. Like I said, I'm white. 
 Related:  Rising deaths among white middle-aged Americans could exceed Aids toll in US
As I drove through the outskirts of the ruins of Detroit, across the I-94, one of the ugliest highways in the United States, the old familiar lightness fluttered to my heart. I love America. America is not my mother. Canada is my mother. But America is an unbelievably gorgeous, surprisingly sweet rich lady who lives next door and appears to be falling apart. I cannot help myself from loving it.
For people who love to dwell in contradictions, the US is the greatest country in the world: the land of the free built on slavery, the country of law and order where everyone is entitled to a gun, a place of unimpeded progress where they cling to backwardness out of sheer stubbornness. And into this glorious morass, a new contradiction has recently announced itself: the white people, the privileged Americans, the ones who had the least to fear from the powers that be, the ones with the surest paths to brighter futures, the ones who are by every metric one of the most fortunate groups in the history of the world, were starting to dying off in shocking numbers.
The Case and Deaton report, Rising Morbidity and Mortality in Midlife among White Non-Hispanic Americans in the 21st Century, describes an increased death rate for middle-aged American whites "comparable to lives lost in the US Aids epidemic". This spike in mortality is unique to white Americans - not to be found among other ethnic groups in the United States or any other white population in the developed world, a mysterious plague of despair.
In one way, it was easy to account for all this white American death - "drug and alcohol poisoning, suicide, and chronic liver diseases and cirrhosis", according to the report. It was not so easy to account for the accounting. Why were middle-aged white Americans drinking and drugging and shooting themselves to death? The explanations on offer were pre-prepared, fully plugged into confirmation bias: it was the economy or it was demography or it was godlessness or it was religion or it was the breakdown of the family or it was the persistence of antique values or it was the lack of social programs or it was the dependence on social programs.
Case and Deaton call it "an epidemic of pain". Fine. What does that mean?
On the I-94, you do find yourself asking: what the fuck is wrong with these people? I mean, aside from the rapid decline of the middle class obviously. And the rise of precarious work and the fact that the basic way of life requires so much sedation that nearly a quarter of all Americans are on psychiatric drugs, and somewhere between 26.4 and 36 million Americans abuse opioids every day. Oh yes, and the mass shootings. There was more than one mass shooting a day. And the white terrorists targeting black churches again. And the regularly released videos showing the police assassinating black people. And the police in question never being indicted, let alone being sent to jail. 
And you know what Americans were worried about while all this shit was raining down on them? While all this insanity was wounding their beloved country? You know what their number one worry was, according to poll after poll after poll?
Muslims. Muslims, if you can believe it. 

'The American dream is dead but I'm going to make it stronger!'
My body is white and it is male. It is six foot tall and weighs 190lb. It is 39 years old and it has had to start running. It has had to start counting calories. There is a tingle in the joint of my right thigh, so I try not to think about my body. The tingling comes and goes. I know my body is going to kill me.
"A man who fears suffering already suffer what he fears," as Montaigne said. That's one of the reasons why men die so much younger than women - six years younger on average in America. Ninety-two percent of men say they wait at least a few days to see if they feel better before they go to a doctor, but I know what they mean by a few days. They mean a few more days than makes sense. It is hard to have a male and white body and to conceive of its weakness. In the same breath, my body cannot bring itself to believe it is the personification of power, though it evidently is in any rational accountancy of social status. It feels like a mere body. It feels mortal.
I've never been to a place as white as Iowa. That's the honest truth. Whenever I go to America it's New York or Chicago or Los Angeles or Florida. In Burlington, at Jerry's Main Lunch, the signature dish is "the hot mess, eggs and bacon cooked right into the hash browns. The sugar shakers all have white crackers in them, to prevent clumping - a classic bit of commonsense American know-how. The hot mess is delicious. Why don't they make these everywhere? Why isn't there a chain of Jerry's Main Lunches serving hot messes all across the midwest? 
The answer is in the rest of the town: everything that's going to leave has already left Burlington. The beautiful brick buildings downtown are mostly vacant. The most interesting street is the road out of town. 
The Memorial Arena, on the banks of the Mississippi, filled up early. Trump wasn't speaking until 6pm but by 4.45 the parking situation was grim. Outside the building, the hawkers who follow Trump on the road, event to event, sold T-shirts and buttons, three for $10. "We shall overcomb." "Cats for Trump, the time is Meow." "MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN."
Inside, every seat had been taken and the floor filled quickly with a standing room only crowd. Burlington is 10% black. The rally was 99.99% white.
The people who attend political rallies in America are a specific genre of humanity, like the people who stand outside in lines for nightclubs. They know where they're supposed to go and how they're supposed to behave when they get there. They have gear.
An elderly lady sat beside me wearing a sequined stars-and-stripes-hat she clearly takes out for just these occasions. "Y'all from Illinois?" she asked. I'm not but I can pass. She goes to all the rallies, she explained. She's been a Republican her whole life, an active Republican, an Iowa Republican. For 30 years, she's been in crowds like this one. She plans to go, one time in her life, to the national convention. Like going to see the Stones. When the organizers passed around hand signs reading "The Silent Majority", she grabbed a dozen so she could pass them around to others.
Cheerful helpful women were half the crowd. Angry and absurd men were the other. They wore T-shirts with whole paragraphs written on them: "I am a United States Military Veteran. I once took a SOLEMN OATH to defend the CONSTITUTION against ALL enemies, foreign and Domestic. Be advised No one has ever relieved me of my duties under this Oath!" 
There were cars in the parking lot slathered with bumper stickers. "We the people are 100% FED UP!" "So if guns kills people, I guess pencils miss spell words [sic], cars drive drunk and spoons make people fat." "I'm straight, conservative, Christian, and I own a gun. Is there anything else I can do to piss you off?" A picture of Obama with "Does this ass make my car look big?" The Republican style for 2016 is angry aphoristic humor. Behind comedy, absurd rage: America is the greatest country in the world but America is falling apart, government is the problem which is why government must solve it.
This was a Trump production so naturally there was a VIP section. A door guarded by bald, unsmiling men, the bouncers who stand forever as the bored sentinels of indifferent celebrity. A swinging door at the side of the stage received and dispensed the best-looking people, the ones with the buffed neutrality of political professionals, the women whose faces have been tautened to a perma pout, the men who get their hair cut before every event.
The woman beside me - Stars 'n' Stripes Hat - was wearing a pewter elephant pendant. A young girl in a bright orange dress passed out of the VIP entrance wearing an elephant pendant encrusted with diamonds. Elephant pendants were a theme, I noticed, and elephant brooches and elephant rings and elephant T-shirts. They came in all different price points and in all different styles: round elephants reminiscent of French cartoons from the 1960s, and strange pseudo-sexual shimmies, and with 1920s straw boater hats leading parades. There was one kind of elephant you couldn't find. An elephant that actually looked like an elephant. A realistic elephant might serve as a memento to the hundred elephants killed for their ivory every day. A naturalistic elephant would be inherently environmentalist. The elephants must all be fabulous.
Like any good show, there was a warm-up act. In fact, there are two - three if you count the recitation of the pledge of allegiance. The first was Tana Goertz, an Iowa woman who had been runner-up on the third season of The Apprentice. "What a good-looking crowd," she pandered. She vouched for Trump as a woman ("He loves women!") and as someone who had returned to Iowa ("How could you live in New York City if you didn't love people?"). She promoted the idea which is at the core of every last thing that Trump does, that simple contact with the man brings prosperity. "When you're in the Trump train you're going places!" She walked off to polite Iowan applause. The crowd would probably, all things considered, rather have listened to the Elton John music playing on the speakers instead, but at least she made the effort. 
A more standard hype man followed. Sam Clovis hosts a conservative radio show and is a Tea Party activist who has run and lost a bunch of Iowa Republican positions. He just started right in with it. Trump was "one of the greatest men to ever walk the face of this earth," a good line - the crowd could have laughed but instead they applauded, thus proving that they were not paying attention or would swallow anything. Clovis compared Trump's recent speeches to Reagan's A Time for Choosing at the Goldwater convention in 1964, which must have been, to his way of thinking anyway, roughly like comparing it to the Sermon on the Mount.
Clovis knew what the crowd had come to hear and he gave it to them. "America and Americans will be first again!" A collective roar shook the Burlington Memorial Arena. They so badly wanted to be first again. First in what was unclear but definitely first.
After the roar died, the crowd was ready for Trump. But, showmanship. Trump let the tension build; the angry absurd men and the cheerful, helpful women hollered. Trump! Trump! Trump! I could barely imagine the pleasure the muted sound of his chanted name, from backstage, must have been bringing the man. 
When he finally took the stage, the crowd surged; their phones surged. It was an orgy of phones. The men behind Trump scanned the crowd with their phones. The cameras in the back were recording everyone recording each other. Trump was the only person not holding a screen, the absence that brought desire. He started roaring, as everybody in the crowd stopped to check the footage they had gathered. 
Trump started out with the clip he knew would appear on the news the next morning - Joe Biden had dropped out of the race and Trump approved of his decision because Biden never had a chance and Trump wanted to face Hillary. The mainstream media adroitly handled, Trump began his disquisition on the subject dearest to his heart: his own success.
The Burlington rally marked the 100th day he had led the polls. He read the polls, poll after poll. He paused only to ask the crowd how great the polls were. "Beating Hillary nationwide do you love that?" The crowd approved of his approval numbers. And so he moved on to the more qualitative aspects of his greatness. His opponents just weren't winners. "I speak from the brain but I also speak from the heart," he said, rambling like a rich know-it-all uncle - "I'm bringing back the jobs from China!" - with brief digressions into self-pity: "Macy's was very disloyal to me. They don't sell my ties any more."
He described, in twists intermittently frank and self-deluded, the brilliance of his own capacity for political manipulation. He talked to the people he was spinning about how cleverly he was spinning them. So he declared "I'm a good Christian" and that if he became president "we're going to be saying merry Christmas", but then he couldn't stop himself from acknowledging the cleverness of his Christian electioneering: "I walked on to a stage with a Bible, everybody likes me better." Trump brought meta to Burlington, Iowa. And he did not deny the crowd that taste of celebrity they desired. What would he say to Caroline Kennedy, the ambassador to Japan? "You're fired!" "You're fired!"
A few spectators started to drift out to beat the traffic and Trump shouted about the silent majority and about how he says what nobody else dares to say and about how he will end free trade and how Mexicans are car thieves (big laugh) and how he wants a piece of the action from the Keystone pipeline and how he's going to help women's health and how America used to be emulated. "The American Dream is dead but I'm going to make it bigger and stronger!" he shouted. At this moment he appeared to me the way every celebrity I have met in the flesh does, like a living pagan idol awaiting sacrifice, a puff-faced Baal. "We're going to win so much," he promised before leaving the stage to Twisted Sister's We're Not Going to Take It.
I stayed to watch Trump work the line. Up close, in person, the hair is much more intricate than it appears on screen. Its construction is tripartite, its significance polyvalent. First and foremost, there is the comb-over, although it can be called a comb-over only in the sense that the mall in Dubai with a ski hill inside it can be called a building. It is hair as state-of-the-art engineering feat, with the diaphanous quality of a cloak out of Norse legend or some miraculous near-weightless metal developed in an advanced German laboratory. It floats over the skull, an act of defiance not only against ageing and loss but against time and space, against reality.
Behind the technical display of the comb-over, as counterpoint, the back is as traditional and old-fashioned as a haircut can be. It's a classic ducktail. It's such a classic that I have only seen it in movies set in the 1950s. Not movies from the 1950s I should be clear, but movies from the 1970s about the 1950s. In between the comb-over and the ducktail, between the two follicular spaces representing the modernistic and the atavistic, the fantastical and the nostalgic, there is a third tranche. Even in person you have to look closely to catch sight of it. It bulges, slightly but only slightly. It is the real part of the hair, the human part, the actual hair. It is the hinge of Donald Trump.
As Trump's campaign for the Republican nomination has unfolded, in all its unlikeliness, he has shaken hands with many thousands of Americans, and posed with many thousands for many thousands of selfies. And among those many thousands, not one has reached up to mess up his hair. Though he regularly brings up the physical appearances of his opponent, none of the other candidates even mention the fact that he looks ridiculous. Trump's hair is an act of defiant social pre-emption: call me a phony. I dare you. I fucking dare you.
A few hardcore fans lingered on the fringes, just like at a concert. Everybody else had drifted into the parking lot and the town center of Burlington was soon returned to its emptiness. A Trump show is good value for the money, especially since it's free. They don't even ask for donations.

The view from Fun City
The morning after the rally, it has become clear that Iowa may be the bramble in Trump's path. A scandal over an errant tweet has cloudburst. 
He blames the insult on a young intern. But the eight-point rise of Carson must be galling. Trump possesses the weakness of anyone who lives by the strength of their results. Results vary. When the results are down, where are you? Who are you? Trump is in the business of winning. Does Trump losing even exist? 
I had a day between Trump and Sanders, and all I had to read was a pdf of Ta-Nehisi Coates's Between the World and Me, which I had agreed to look at for a book of the month club. After another hot mess at Jerry's Main Lunch, and a run to burn it off, I spent a day at the Motel 8 in Burlington reading, while across the street, the Winegard factory, manufacturing satellite dishes 24 hours a day, thudded like a heart without syncopation. Did you know you can buy a six pack of beer and a bottle of bourbon for just a little over 20 bucks in Iowa? What a great country. 
The title of Between the World and Me comes from a Richard Wright poem called White Man, Listen! and it was never going to get much whiter or more male than me in the Motel 8 sipping bourbon and beer, on my iPhone, with the Jays and Royals highlights flickering in the background and the thud of the satellite dish factory in the background. 
The urgency of the book, the vitality of the historical imagination at play, rose like waves into crests of anger tumbling over their own force. It was all of a piece. And it all made very ferocious sense. Between the World and Me is one of those books that possess the powerful inevitability of a natural phenomenon - as if it accrued out of the ether that surrounds us, a crystalline formation of the outrage that defines the moment. To criticize is beside the point. It's just there.
To me, the key passage in Between the World and Me, comes after Coates has been on television explaining to the host the desperate consequences of yet another police assassination of a black boy. 
 I came out of the studio and walked for a while. It was a calm December day. Families, believing themselves white, were out on the streets. Infants, raised to be white, were bundled in strollers. And I was sad for these people, much as I was sad for the host and sad for all the people out there watching and reveling in a specious hope. I realized then why I was sad. When the journalist asked me about my body, it was like she was asking me to awaken her from the most gorgeous dream. I have seen that dream all my life. It is perfect houses with nice lawns. It is Memorial Day cookouts, block associations, and driveways. The Dream is treehouses and the Cub Scouts. The Dream smells like peppermint but tastes like strawberry shortcake.  
Right then, reading that passage, I knew that white people were going to love this book. What white people crave - more, they require it, they require it to live - is an alibi from their whiteness, an escape from the injustice of their existence. There are various alibis available depending on how much stupidity you can tolerate. You can say to yourself or to others that black people are stupid and lazy; you can say that you don't see color; you can call your uncle a racist so everybody knows you're not; you can share the latest critique of brutality on Twitter with the word THIS; and now you can tell a friend that she really has to read Between the World and Me. 
Because that Dream of Whiteness, the dream of treehouses and cub scouts that tastes like peppermint and smells like strawberry shortcake, is a perfect alibi. Who lives that dream? Somebody else may live it but not me, not anyone I know, no one I could see in Burlington. That's a dream that belongs to somebody else. Always to somebody else.
It certainly didn't belong to the Winegard factory workers who were drifting to their cars at the end of their shift. The whiteness of my existence was my iPhone and the fumes of bourbon and beer, and the game from last night and the tingling in my thigh. The tingling in my thigh was my body - the reality I can't look at because I'm too afraid of my mortality. 
To me, the best question ever asked about race in America has always been the one that James Baldwin asked, when an interviewer wanted to know if he was optimistic or pessimistic about the future of America. "What white people have to do is try and find out in their own hearts why it was necessary to have a nigger in the first place," he said. "If you invented him, you, the white people invented him, then you've got to find out why. And the future of the country depends on that." The obsession of intellectuals over the question of Malcolm X or Martin Luther King, Jr active or passive resistance - was moot; the pressing matter was why white people were blowing up churches filled with children.
Whiteness is a spiritual distortion, evidently - by the fruit ye shall know the tree. And on the question of white pathology, what good answers has America produced since Baldwin asked that question in 1963? And now that white pathology has returned to waste away its host, unexamined and mysterious, a golem. 
In the evening, I finished the book and didn't want to think about my white and male body any more, or the tingling in my thigh.
Across from my hotel, the Fun City complex contained an imitation midway, a bowling alley, a couple of bars, a replica diner and, tucked in between a hotel and a spa, the Catfish Bend Casino. The poker room is dingy but serviceable. A game started at six. I wanted to play. I wanted to find out how much fun can you have in a place called Fun City. 
The youngest guy at the table, Curved Baseball Hat, grew beans and corn. A man with an angry mustache ran the conversation, a three-day beard beside him adding an occasional aside. The rest of us sat cooking quietly in the juices of our addictions, like in any casino. Everybody at the table knew everybody else, except for me and a black welder in town for a specialist job. It was happy hour in Fun City, and beer was a dollar. Everybody ordered a mess of them. And I felt just how lucky it is to be in America, despite politics, despite everything. Cheap beer and frank people and an honestly run game in a clean room. Even compared to Canada, the unthinking prosperity of the place is dazzling.
 Three Day Beard had seen Trump the night before, and Angry Mustache asked his opinion.
 "I think he could win," Three Day Beard said cautiously, as if it were a criticism, as if it were all you could say of him, that he might have a chance to take the presidency, for what it was worth.
 "Don't matter," said Angry Mustache. "No matter who gets in, Washington just ruins them."
 "He might be different because he doesn't need the money."
 Angry Mustache quoted a statistic, which I later check and turns out to be bullshit, that all congressmen become millionaires by the time they've been in office for a year. Everybody agreed that Trump's main advantage is that he comes pre-corrupted.
 "It's not even the money," Three Day Beard said. "They get there. They all have these schemes and plans. They can't do anything." Three Day Beard almost pitied the politicians. 
 "It's all broken," added Angry Mustache as a kind of given, the way you'd state any historical fact, like "Germany lost the second world war" or "Frances Farmer was once a star."
The view of American politics in Fun City is snug despair. It is despair not just at who happens to be in power but at whoever could ever be in power. It is despair not simply that the system is broken but that any system, imaginable in the current iteration of the United States, would turn out to be just as broken. The choice is a choice between impotence and coercion. The response was not revolution but a shrug. 
Curved Baseball Hat, the guy who grows corn and beans and who had delicate traces of soil in the lunulae of his fingernails, asked about an old gambling hall that used to be in town, and the reminiscences of the way Burlington used to be flowed - buildings that had been knocked down, women that were once beautiful and were now dead, fortunes made and vanished. 
Eventually the black player, who has said almost nothing except his calls and folds and raises, busted out.
"Did you see that guy's fingers?" Angry Mustache asks when he had left. He gestured an inch past his middle finger. We were all, it was made very clear, in a room of white men. "You know what they say. My brother worked in the prison and he says it's all true. I guess that's why they say once you go black."
 The rest of us nodded or smiled or said nothing, looking down at the cards. Now that we had all shown how white we were, it was a friendlier room. We knew that none of us would object to the evil of the others. What if the answer to Baldwin's question is as banal as it appeared to be in Fun City? What if it white people make the nigger to make themselves a little less lonely? 
And I said nothing. I offered no resistance, though the line between the man in Fun City and the cop shooting a black child in the face was not hard to trace. Here was my alibi that evening: I am Canadian. Which means I am a spy from nowhere. Or perhaps I am a coward or something in between a coward and spy from nowhere. It's a pretty threadbare alibi anyway. Whose isn't? 
Conversation drifted back to Trump. It was more polite. 
 "I can see Trump," said Angry Mustache. "He's not the worst that I've seen anyway."
"I'm starting to like that doctor," Three Day Beard adds as an afterthought. 
That doctor, Ben Carson, proposes a flat tax of 10% that would put the US government, estimating conservatively, in a $3tn deficit. He believes that Joseph built the pyramids to store grain, and he believes that Hitler never would have risen to power if the German people were armed, and that Obamacare is worse than slavery, and that Americans are living in a Gestapo age. 
I wish that Coates had some crazy scheme, some utopian fantasy for communards in Georgia, or the return to one motherland or another, but he just wants the end of white supremacy. He just wants white people in America to grow up, to cede their inhumane sense of absurd superiority. I cannot imagine why they would. It's fun to drink and to play cards and to imagine what Donald Trump would say to the Mexican president the day after he was elected, or whether Ben Carson would set the flat tax at 10 or 12%. The ultimate alibi is ignorance - it lies closest to innocence - but if you can't manage ignorance, craziness does nearly as well. 
I mean, none of it's going to happen anyway, right? Whoever gets elected, it's just going to be gridlock and outrage anyway, right? Did I mention that beer cost one dollar? A single, solitary buck. 

'Ellen Degeneres, eat your heart out!'
The Bernie Sanders rally in Davenport was the precise opposite of the Donald Trump rally in Burlington and yet precisely the same in every detail. "Make America Great Again" was replaced by "Feel the Bern". Hawkers sold pins, three for $10. They read "Bernie Sanders is my spirit animal" and "Cats for Bernie" and "I supported Bernie Sanders before it was cool." Davenport, at least near the Adler Theater, is the same Brooklyn-outside-Brooklyn that has conquered every corner of the world that is not a strip mall. The tattoo artists of Davenport do not go hungry. The cornfed hipsters at the Sanders rally look like they have probably attended a party at which somebody played a bongo. They may even have attended a literary reading. 
There were hype men as with Trump, too, although in this case they were twentyish women in glasses screaming "Feel the Bern!" and "We're Going to Build a Revolution!" Somebody with a camera from NBC asked a group who has brought their precocious children because they want them to be engaged in the political process "Can I get you guys to look like you're excited about Bernie?" They carefully placed their drinks on the floor, out of sight, to oblige. 
The same specter of angry white people haunts Saunders's rally, the same sense of longing for a country that was, the country that has been taken away. The Bernie crowd brought homemade signs instead of manufactured ones, because I guess they're organic. They waved them just the same. They were going to a show. They wanted to be a good audience. 
The fundamental difference between the Trump and Sanders crowd was that the Sanders crowd has more money, the natural consequence of the American contradiction machinery: rich white people can afford to think about socialism, the poor can only afford their anger. 
Sanders's opening act was a congressional hopeful, Gary Kroeger. He hadn't been on The Apprentice but on Saturday Night Live, a forgettable lesser actor from the great period between 1982 and 1985. He started out, naturally, with a half-assed gag: "the fresh patchouli in the air is so beautiful". The sign language translator offered a mild smile to indicate it was a joke. Then, after a brief foray into leftwingery, calling America a "social democracy also known as a republic", Kroeger took a big selfie with the crowd behind him: "Ellen Degeneres, eat your heart out!" he shouted. Everyone's phones rose up to take pictures of themselves in a picture imitating a picture from the Oscars: such was American socialism in the year 2015. 
A few desultory bands followed, performing an assortment of leftwing songs from various historical leftwing movements. They harmonized on The Auld Triangle, a prison ballad that was covered on Inside Llewelyn Davis. The singer from Alice in Chains (remember them?) did an electric version of I Won't Back Down. An old The Clash song, Jail Guitar Doors, was sung by the subject of the first verse, Wayne Kramer. And it was all, so obviously, a nostalgia act, the indulgence for a longing of a time when music encouraged politics, when activism possessed an artistic face, and vice versa. 
Eventually Bernie wandered out. The phones went up. The phones went down. "Enough is enough," he shouted, leaving blank what there's been enough of. And then he talked about how he wanted to end the war on drugs and campaign finance reform and government that isn't for plutocrats, and how they were going to build a revolution (such an embarrassing word to hear uttered out loud), and America was going to be a social democracy, by the people of the people. 
Sanders's exasperation was the principal fact to be communicated, more than any political content. Trump was about winning again. Sanders was about having lost. The vagueness of American politics is what astonished the outsider. It's all about feelings and God and bullshit. Sanders actually uttered the following sentence out loud: "What we're saying is when millions of people come together to restore their government we can do extraordinary things." Nobody asked what he meant. Nobody asked for numbers. They applauded. Better to take it in the spirit in which it's given, like a Catskills resort comedian. 
Sanders reminded me of a line from Seinfeld, maybe because Larry David's SNL parody was only a few days' old. "The sea was angry that day, my friends, like an old man trying to send back soup at a deli." When Ben and Jerry make a Bernie Sanders ice cream, I hope it's chili and ginger: the delicious hot flavour of nasal-passage clearing outrage. 
Sanders's speech was much shorter than Trump's. There had already been the music, I guess. I had the impression, as with Trump, that I had traveled many hundreds of miles to look at a man's hair. Bernie Sanders's hair is as much a statement as Trump's. It looks like the hair of a tenured professor whose wife has stopped nagging him to get a haircut because the nagging doesn't work. You couldn't muss Sanders hair. The disorder is just as much an aesthetic as the comb-over. I mean it always looks the same. Somebody is cutting it to droop that way over the ears.

The view from Tampico
As despair has suddenly spread like a fabulous mist over the white people of America, as the white people die off in their unprecedented numbers, the commenters are surprised, a bit, but they have no plan of action. No policy proposals aim at ameliorating the conditions of white people. 
How could they? If you believe the Case and Deaton report, white people are victims of their own privilege - literally. Their cherished right to own guns, and the vast increase in the ownership of weaponry, means that their suicide attempts are more effective. They have more access to opioids because doctors are more likely to trust white people with them. They have the money to make themselves lonely and drink. 
I remember reading a passage from bell hooks once, the kind that circulates on Facebook because it sounds slightly unusual in its predictable virtue. "The first act of violence that patriarchy demands of males," she wrote, "is not violence toward women. Instead patriarchy demands of all males that they engage is psychic self-mutilation, that they kill off the emotional parts of themselves." 
Her compassion is admirable, glorious even, but also inaccurate. No one is more emotional than a piece-of-shit white man. They are sentimentality personified. How else can so many be moved to rage over the absence of a Christmas tree on a Starbucks cup?
 That dream, that white dream that smells like peppermint and tastes like strawberry shortcake, comes with a cost of shit. If you take shit, if you eat shit, if you live through the shit, if you survive the stupid wars and the meaningless jobs, you should be sure of who you are and what you deserve. And if you are not sure and you have not received what you deserved, why did you take and eat and breathe all that shit?
In the aftermath of that deal, the choice, I suppose, is either to be proud to be white, which is a form of insanity, or to fantasize a post-racial cosmopolis, which is a kind of make-believe, or to be ashamed. So much easier to forget those choices, or to defer endlessly the choosing, or to debate the difficulties of choosing infinitely, because white male flesh is not under mortal threat, as the flesh of black men or the flesh of women. Our bodies are safe. Our bodies are the threat.
In medieval monarchies, the state required the existence of a double body, one for the real world and one for the symbolic. There was the flawed and mortal body of the king, which wept and shat and screwed and died, and then there was the Body of the King, sacred, pure, indestructible.
Race gives us all double bodies, "double consciousness" in WEB Du Bois's phrase, whatever you want to call having to live mortally through the judgment of others. The new white distortion, the sickness at heart, the pathology, may simply be the arrival of the awareness of two bodies: the dizziness and nausea that arrive with the onset of double vision. 
Because they have to be like everybody else, their hearts are breaking in half.
The morning after the Sanders rally, I found enough strength to look in the mirror at my white and male body, to examine its mortal and symbolic nature. At the corner of my groin, where it had been tingling, a brown patch spilled like spoiled milk down my skin. A wide brown patch shaped like post-climate change Florida in the corner of my thigh. Instantly, I knew I would die. And the next moment I started driving back to Toronto, to my wife and children, flesh of my flesh.
Bernie Sanders wants a revolution to overthrow casino capitalism but the problem, or maybe just the first problem, is that the American people love casinos. They can't build them fast enough. On the road from Iowa, I passed at least a dozen, a dozen Fun Cities of various shapes and sizes, enduring various conversations about Trump and Sanders. The highways of Illinois are a unique vision of the workings of human desire - a nearly limitless marketplace for addiction and its cure. Strip clubs or fried chicken or gambling or church or rehab or cancer treatment. The I-94 spoke right to the unwounded body - the promise of processed sugar and pussy, or salvation from them. 
 There was one other attraction on the route home: Ronald Reagan's birthplace in Tampico. The beauty of the landscape around those towns, for some reason, has never been properly romanticized. There are no tourist buses to these fields, as there are to the ocean or the mountains, but the landscape is every bit as sublime. Reagan's childhood passed in the loin of the continent, the grand hinge between the industrial core of the Great Lakes and the agricultural heartland. The historical memory of his presidential monuments has been consumed by fantasies of small-town life but it is a landscape of whitewashed buildings against the undulating emptiness, a country roiling with dreams. You can picture Reagan as a boy in these fields, dreaming of movies and America - vast screens on which he could project himself. The highway runs like a river of craving through an ancient dream. 
The ancient dreams are still so vivid here. In the United States, 240-year-old writings can be recited by heart by people who cannot be described as educated. Documents written by men who owned slaves are spoken of as if they could solve the problems of today and tomorrow and any conceivable future no matter how distant. 
Thomas Jefferson believed that the constitution should expire after 19 years, so that the dead would not have dominion over the living. That fate seems to have arrived. The Americans are in constant debates with ghosts and their conversations with dead people are most powerful, most ferocious, at exactly the points where they are most nonsensical. They state defiantly that all men are created equal when any casual observer of life knows they aren't. They claim that men and women should be judged by the content of their character, when nobody can know the content of another's character. These dreams, these impossibilities, are the absolute and real foundation of their nation. And the dreams are so entrancing that it's unclear whether the problem is that the Americans believe them, or that they don't. It's supremely childish, either way. 
Back in Toronto, my wife took a look at the brown patch on my groin and sent me to a doctor, and the doctor told me it was a rash from running too much, and I had been given the greatest gift anyone can hope for, in this time and this place. I had been forgiven, for a while, for my body.

VW emissions scandal set to overshadow Detroit Motor Show; 
Volkwagen will showcase its new vehicles at the US's largest car show on Monday in the face of the ongoing fallout from Dieselgate.

Benjamin Preston.

On Sunday night, as Detroit fills with auto journalists and car executives, Volkswagen will hold a media party at Fishbone's, the Cajun-themed restaurant in the city's Greektown neighbourhood. It'll be the opening salvo in a PR offensive the German company will be hoping can finally turn the tide after arguably the worst year in its history.
Three months after the revelation that Volkswagen Group was using an illegal software fix called a "defeat device" to circumvent US environmental regulations on about 600,000 of its diesel-powered passenger cars, the company will showcase its new vehicles at the US's largest car show on Monday.  
The unveiling, however, is sure to be overshadowed by news that the Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that could result in about $48bn in fines and penalties. 
The defeat device has been seen by federal and international regulators and many consumers as an egregious flouting of environmental protection laws. The justice department said in a statement last Monday that the vehicles - certain Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche models equipped with 2- and 3-litre diesel engines - had emitted as much as 40 times the accepted level of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) into the atmosphere. 
 Related:  VW 'close to agreement with US regulators' over emissions scandal
"With today's filing, we take an important step to protect public health by seeking to hold Volkswagen accountable for any unlawful air pollution," Cynthia Giles, a administrator with the EPA's office of enforcement and compliance assurance, said in the statement. 
Dieselgate, as it's become known, has affected about 11m vehicles worldwide. The scandal prompted yet another apology from Volkswagen, this time from Dr Herbert Diess, Volkswagen's chief executive of passenger vehicles, who addressed a crowd at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week. 
Although the department has also been investigating VW executives over criminal fraud allegations, no charges have been filed. Martin Winterkorn, who had been chief executive of Volkswagen Group since 2007, resigned several days after news of the scandal broke but denied any personal involvement in the cheat. 
New CEO Matthias M¸eller will be in Washington on Wednesday, when the press days at Detroit have wrapped up, for a grilling by the EPA.
Moving beyond the scandal is imperative for VW. Sales have dropped 4% this year, with a 9% decrease in December alone, according to figures provided by Kelley Blue Book. 
"The diesel scandal has affected VW about how we expected," Akshay Anand, an analyst for Kelley Blue Book, said. "Sales are down, but they haven't killed the company. Transaction prices are down a bit, too, but they're not overwhelming." 
Anand said VW was planning a big product release at the end of 2016 and suggested that the company should be more proactive about resolving potential recalls on existing vehicles. 
"If they don't have it figured out by then, it may affect sales," Anand said. "That's still a ways off though, so there's time for VW to right the ship." 
Giles, from the EPA, expressed dissatisfaction with the federal government's talks with VW thus far. "So far, recall discussions with the company have not produced an acceptable way forward," she said. "These discussions will continue in parallel with the federal court action."
 Related:  Volkswagen scandal tarnishes hard-won US reputation as green company
Anand said consumers had been - for the most part - forgiving of Volkswagen's actions. But Ashley Scarpa, who owns a 2014 Volkswagen Passat TDI, felt differently. She said VW mailed her a $500 Visa card, three years of roadside assistance and a $500 VW gift certificate that she doesn't know what to do with. 
"My car is less than a year old, with maintenance included for the first three years, so I'm not sure what I'll do with the VW card that expires in a year," she said, adding that she already had roadside assistance through her insurance. "Maybe I can buy tires and store them in my garage?" 
But as a sea turtle conservation volunteer and someone who generally cares about the environment, she says she still feels betrayed. The right thing to do, she reasoned, would be for VW to buy back the car or issue a partial refund. 
The emissions scandal has undone decades of wooing US customers with promises of a greener future, and VW has a lot to prove this week. 
"What I really want is what I thought I was buying," Scarpa said. "I want my car to be environmentally superior, but at this point - at the very least - I want it to be compliant with emissions standards."

Thousands of Hong Kong protesters gather to demand release of booksellers; 
Five Hong Kong booksellers have vanished since October and many suspect they were abducted by Chinese security forces because of books critical of China.

Tom Phillips in Beijing.

Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets of Hong Kong to demand the release of a group of political booksellers they suspect were abducted by Chinese security forces and are being held in mainland China. 
 Related:  Gui Minhai: the strange disappearance of a publisher who riled China's elite
Five Hong Kong booksellers - Gui Minhai, Lee Bo, Lui Bo, Cheung Ji-ping and Lam Wing-kei - who specialised in books criticising China's Communist party elite have vanished since October. 
Beijing has repeatedly refused to comment directly on the case but there is widespread suspicion that the men's apparent detentions - in Thailand, southern China and Hong Kong - are designed to halt the publication of salacious tomes about the private lives of top party figures.
One source told the Guardian Gui and Lee had been preparing to publish a book about Chinese president Xi Jinping when the disappearances began. 
On Sunday afternoon demonstrators gathered outside Hong Kong's government headquarters - the scene of last year's umbrella movement pro-democracy protests - carrying placards and banners that read: "Release Hong Kong Booksellers Now!" and "Against political persecution!" 
Albert Ho, a Democratic party lawmaker who helped organise the march, said demonstrators wanted the booksellers' "immediate release". They were also demanding an explanation from Beijing about the apparent "kidnapping" of Lee Bo, a British passport holder who vanished in Hong Kong earlier this month.
 Related:  Britain says suspected abduction of bookseller would be 'egregious breach' by China
"They owe us an answer," said Ho. "We are legitimately entitled to be notified about the status of Hong Kong citizens who are being detained in China."
Sin Chung-kai, another Democratic party politician, said the scandal left the 'one country, two systems' model, under which Hong Kong has operated with far greater freedoms than the mainland since handover in 1997, "on the verge of collapse". 
"It is totally terrifying," Sin told broadcaster RTHK.
The booksellers'still unexplained disappearances have sparked international condemnation.
On Friday the US said it was "disturbed" by the unfolding scandal. The EU said the continuing lack of information about the booksellers' welfare and whereabouts was "extremely worrying", adding: "Respect for freedom of expression underpins all free societies." 
During a two-day visit to China last week, British foreign secretary Philip Hammond said Beijing would be guilty of an "egregious breach" of Hong Kong's autonomy if the involvement of its agents in Lee Bo's snatching was confirmed. 
Some describe Lee Bo's suspected abduction as a potentially fatal blow to the former colony's supposed autonomy from authoritarian China.
Beijing's continued silence over the case would signal it was "no longer willing to keep [its] promise about 'one country, two systems,'" said Ho. 
"I think they know how serious this matter is in terms of maintaining confidence in the 'one country, two systems', not only of the Hong Kong people but also of the international community and the investors in Hong Kong," he said. 
 Related:  'Smear campaign' against Chinese president linked to disappearance of Hong Kong booksellers
The failure to release the men would be a "catastrophic and devastating" mistake on Beijing's part, the veteran campaigner added. 
The disappearances have also mobilised a younger generation of democracy activist in Hong Kong.
A viral online video in which 19-year-old activist Agnes Chow calls for answers from Beijing has now been viewed more than 945,000 times since it was posted on Facebook at the start of this month. 
On the eve of Sunday's protest one Hong Kong newspaper published extracts from a video and letter, supposedly written by Lee Bo, in which he claims he is "confused and puzzled" by the "fuss" surrounding his situation. 
In the letter, which many suspect he was pressured into writing, Lee claimed he had travelled to mainland China in order to resolve "personal issues".

'El Chapo' prison break: most Mexicans think government helped drug lord; 
Survey finds only half think he will be recaptured and 77% say officials played part in escape last month.

Nina Lakhani in Mexico City.

Three quarters of Mexicans believe that corrupt officials helped drug cartel boss Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzm·n escape from prison last month, a new survey has found.
 Related:  'El Chapo' affair: inside the prison from which Mexican drug lord escaped
Guzm·n disappeared from the Altiplano high security prison on 11 July, after apparently slipping through a hole in the floor of his shower and then escaping through a newly dug mile-long tunnel that ran under the prison grounds, government officials have said. 
But only 46% of Mexicans said they believed the official version of events, while 40% thought he escaped by some other route, according to a survey carried out by the polling company ParametrÌa. While 77% believe the state played a part in his escape, only 17% believe it was solely masterminded by Guzm·n's colleagues in the Sinaloa cartel.
Only half think he will be recaptured.
Mexico is rife with conspiracy theories, not least because the official versions of high-profile crimes often turn out to be untrue. Meanwhile corruption scandals involving state officials at all levels - from the president to mayors and local police - are shockingly common. 
In the case of Guzm·n, many Mexicans are particularly incredulous as this was his second escape from a supposedly high-security prison.
In 2001, he absconded after serving eight years of a 20-year sentence by co-opting a senior security official who went on to become his right-hand man in the Sinaloa cartel. Officials said that Guzm·n escaped by hiding in a laundry cart. But in her book Los seÒores del Narco (Narcoland: The Mexican Drug Lords and their Godfathers), Mexican journalist Anabel Hernandez alleges that Guzm·n walked out of the main entrance wearing a police uniform - a day before he was reported as officially missing.
 Related:  El Chapo's escape humiliates Mexican president: 'The state looks putrefied'
Guzm·n, rated by Forbes as the world's 14th richest man, was re-captured in March 2014 after what the US described as the biggest manhunt in history. His latest escape has caused huge embarrassment for President Enrique Pena Nieto, who had impressed the Americans with the capture of several high-profile drug traffickers since taking power in December 2012.
The alternative versions currently circulating include the theory that the man in Altiplano was a look-alike because Guzm·n never went to prison in the first place ; that the government reneged on a pact to let him out of prison after a few months, so he took matters into his own hands; and that the government let him escape so he could help negotiate a truce with the other cartel bosses.
The proportion of people who view Guzm·n negatively has actually fallen from 76% in 2011 to only 56% today, according to the surveys carried out by ParametrÌa.
Perhaps the most worryingly detail in today's survey is that 42% of people think Guzm·n is as dangerous inside prison as out, and 52% do not think there is any point of him being re-captured - indicting just how far trust in the government has fallen.
Lenin Martell, professor of communication and cultural studies at the Autonomous University of the State of Mexico, said: "Most people in Mexico do not believe official stories or reports anymore - especially those related to crime. Nowadays, people are much better informed and better educated, especially the younger generation, and they are tired of lies, corruption, and clumsy declarations. This signifies a failing political system that cannot sustain itself anymore."

Sean Penn's trek to Sierra Madre left direct trail to El Chapo, Mexico says; 
Country's attorney general says actor was under surveillance as photographs reveal Hollywood star turned gonzo journalist was the ultimate tip-off.

David Agren in Mexico City.

Sean Penn's foray into the world of gonzo journalism led directly to the capture of Mexico's most wanted criminal, said the country's attorney general on Monday, as leaked photographs appeared to show that the Hollywood star was under surveillance as he made his way to meet JoaquÌn "El Chapo" Guzm·n.
Mexico's attorney general, Arely GÛmez, said that Penn's journey to the rugged Sierra Madre mountains was "essential" to tipping them off to the drug lord's whereabouts, according to Reuters.  
 Related:  Soap actor Kate del Castillo: from Mexican starlet to drug lord's sweetheart
His comments came after the Mexico City daily El Universal published a series of photographs that appeared to show Penn and the Mexican actor Kate del Castillo as they arrived in Guadalajara and prepared to fly on to the encounter.
Castillo, who had starred as a fictional cartel boss in a TV soap opera, was first approached by one of El Chapo's lawyers in October 2014, with a request from the drug lord for advice on making a feature film based on his life, the newspaper said. 
Castillo and the lawyer AndrÈs Grandos Flores then met in a Mexico City restaurant in July 2015, supposedly to discuss the payment of royalties and film rights, El Universal reported.
The next time they met - in Guadalajara on 25 September - Guzm·n's legal team gave Del Castillo a "special" telephone, with which she could contact Guzm·n directly, said the newspaper, citing a Mexican intelligence report.
Del Castillo returned to Guadalajara on 2 October, this time with Penn. Photographs in El Universal show Penn, wearing sunglasses and a baseball cap, meeting a group of men who took him and Del Castillo to an airstrip in Nayarit state from where they flew in a small aeroplane to El Chapo's jungle camp in the municipality of Cosal·, in Sinaloa.
Shortly after the meeting, Guzm·n narrowly escaped capture in a raid, but his luck ran out on Friday when he was apprehended by Mexican marines in the coastal city of Los Mochis. 
According to a report by the broadcaster Televisa, Guzm·n initially eluded capture through a reinforced door hidden behind a mirror, and descending into a tunnel leading to the city's drains.
The marines took 90 minutes to find the opening mechanism for the concealed door, which was hidden in a dressing room light. Items found inside the house included DVDs of La Reina del Sur, a soap opera about a female cartel boss which starred Del Castillo.
Penn's rambling account of his meeting with the fugitive drug lord appeared on Rolling Stone's website on Saturday.
Penn has been widely criticised for meeting Guzm·n - and giving him copy approval for the Rolling Stone article - but on Monday he expressed no regrets over the episode, telling the Associated Press: "I've got nothin' to hide."
On Sunday night, Interpol said it had begun the process to extradite Guzm·n to the United States, though Mexican authorities admit the process will proceed slowly, giving the recaptured cartel kingpin at least another year in the same high-security prison he once escaped from. 
The head of Mexico's extradition office, Manuel Merino, told Radio Formula in Mexico City that no mechanism exists to expedite Guzm·n's extradition, and the drug lord was free to seek injunctions against the process. 
Lawyers for Guzm·n say they have filed six motions against extradition. 
Guzm·n's past escapes - once in a laundry cart wheeled out of a Guadalajara-area prison in 2001 and most recently through a mile-long tunnel under his cell-room shower - were prompted in part by fears he could face trial in the US. Analysts say he was able to continue running his cartel from behind bars in Mexico and enjoyed privileges such as conjugal visits.
"I think El Chapo, like other big capos, fears extradition more than anything," said Malcolm Beith, author of the 2011 biography The Last Narco. "He'll never get out of a US prison and won't enjoy any luxuries there."
 Related:  How will El Chapo's recapture affect Mexico and narco-trafficking?
But the extent to which the arrest will weaken El Chapo's Sinaloa cartel remains uncertain.
An unverified but widely followed Twitter account in the name of Iv·n Archivaldo Guzm·n - El Chapo's son and presumed successor - said: "Nothing changes here, we will continue working because as my father said, although they're shafting us we have to hold our heads high."
The capture has been a boost for President Enrique PeÒa Nieto, whose embattled administration has been battered by corruption scandals and questions of competence.
"Mexico today confirms that its institutions have the ability necessary to face and defeat those who threaten the tranquillity of Mexican families," PeÒa Nieto told a meeting of Mexican diplomats on Monday. The president also said that overall crime had dropped 12% during his three years in office and that 98 of the 122 most wanted criminals had been captured.
It was a change of approach for an administration, which has previously preferred to keep quiet on issues of security in an attempt to improve Mexico's international image. Analysts says the boasting over bagging El Chapo is warranted, though not likely to last
"It is a win," says Alejandro Hope, security analyst and former intelligence official in Mexico City. "Previous cartel capo captures produced an increase in the approval rating, then there's a return to the mean."
Not everyone expressed enthusiasm over the capture or PeÒa Nieto's praise for the work of Mexico's security institutions. Two-time leftwing presidential candidate AndrÈs Manuel LÛpez Obrador contrasted the capture with the authorities to discover the fate of 43 student teachers who disappeared and are believed to have been murdered after the buses they were travelling on came under fire from municipal police officers. 
"They can detain El Chapo, but not able to find 43 missing Ayotzinapa students," he said.

Swedish police accused of covering up sex attacks by refugees at music festival; 
PM says police report's failure to mention incidents at 2014 event amounts to 'double betrayal', while reports emerge on New Year's Eve attacks in Malmˆ.

David Crouch in Gothenburg.

Sweden's prime minister has condemned a "double betrayal" of women after allegations that police covered up sexual harassment by recent immigrants at a music festival in Stockholm. Meanwhile, reports have emerged of attacks on women in Malmˆ on New Year's Eve.
Groups of refugees molested concertgoers at We Are Stockholm, Europe's largest youth festival, in the summer of 2014, according to internal police memos obtained by Dagens Nyheter, a daily newspaper. 
"These are so-called refugee youths, specifically from Afghanistan. Several of the gang were arrested for sexual molestation," one police memo said.
Yet the official police report on the five-day festival attended by 170,000 young people aged mainly 13-19 made no mention of sexual harassment or assaults. 
The prime minister, Stefan Lˆfven, said this amounted to a double betrayal since no one was prosecuted for the crimes and the police did not make them public.
The reports come as police in Cologne, Germany, investigate hundreds of claims of assaults on women on New Year's Eve. Officials say nearly all of the suspects in the attacks were "people with an immigrant background". Police and the media have been accused of deliberately under-reporting the events in order not to encourage anti-immigrant sentiment.
In the Stockholm case, an anti-immigrant website linked to the far right Sweden Democrats, Nyeter Idag, claimed that Dagens Nyheter itself received reports about the assaults very soon after the festival but did not publicise them because they might benefit the far-right party, who campaign to stop immigration. Dagens Nyheter vehemently denied the claim, producing a full rebuttal on their website. 
The festival took place a month before general elections in which the Sweden Democrats came third. 
During the 2014 festival, organisers picked up on rumours of a new phenomenon, said Roger Ticoalu, head of events at the Stockholm city administration. 
"It was a modus operandi that we had never seen before: large groups of young men who surround girls and molest them," Ticoalu said. "In the cases where we were able to apprehend suspects, they were with a foreign background, newly arrived refugees aged 17-20, who had come to Sweden without their families."
He said festival organisers did not have enough facts at the time to say anything definitive, and it would have been "totally irresponsible on our side to make anything public". After the festival the organisers launched a programme with police and NGOs to encourage girls and young women to report harassment and to identify culprits, he said.
There were 20 reports of assault or harassment at the festival in 2015, Ticoalu said, but no evidence of any ethnic dimension to the attackers.
A spokesperson for the festival organisers, who wished to remain anonymous, said: "We have seen different waves of this sort of violence over time. Sexual harassment is something that happens in society, so everything that is happening in society will definitely happen there."
The national police commissioner, Dan Eliasson, promised a full investigation into the 2014 festival. The Sweden Democrats said the police had been "paralysed by political correctness". 
Bjˆrn Sˆder, one of the party's MPs, told Expressen : "It is a scandal without equal. Could this have happened at several locations in the country, but they don't tell you certain things because it could 'play into the hands' [of the Sweden Democrats]'?" 
Ticoalu said he had not heard reports of similar assaults happening at Sweden's other big music festivals, but he "would not be shocked" if they had. Stockholm police did not respond to requests for comment.
Separately, police in Malmˆ, Sweden's third city, said that on New Year's Eve gangs of young men surrounded women and molested them. 
A couple of hundred men, described as "unaccompanied from Afghanistan", were involved in what was "a new phenomenon", a police spokesperson told the Sydsvenskan newspaper. No women made a formal complaint, police said.
Susanna Udvardi, director of the South-east SkÂne Women's Shelter, who has also led volunteer efforts to help refugees integrate in southern Sweden, said: "Vulgar and demeaning treatment of women, including serious harassment, is far from the preserve of immigrant men from the Middle East.
"I am dismayed by how simplistic the climate of debate in Sweden has become. Most refugees have enormous respect for women."
The pattern of harassment was repeated at the festival in 2015, but the police and organisers were prepared for it and intervened to prevent it, according to Varg Gyllander, a spokesperson for Stockholm police. It is police policy not to comment on the ethnic background of perpetrators, he said.
The number of reports of harassment in 2015, around 15, had to be viewed in the context of 170,000 people each day in an open access area with no control over people coming and going. "Of course it was serious: 15 cases is still too many, but it is also not very much," Gyllander said.
The failure to make the incidents public was not an organised cover-up, he said, but rather "self censorship" on the part of individual officers. "There are police employees that are afraid of talking about these things in the context of the immigration debate today," he said.

Playboy Mansion's $200m listing includes Hugh Hefner as a roommate; 
The 89-year-old founder of the pornography magazine plans to continue living and working at property known for its scandalous celebrity parties until he dies.

Amanda Holpuch in New York.

The Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles is for sale - and available to anyone with $200m to spare and an ability to accommodate an 89-year-old roommate clad in crimson silk pajamas.
The Holmby Hills property - part of the Playboy magazine empire founded by Hugh Hefner - boasts 29 rooms, a grotto where Hefner held his infamous parties ... and Hefner himself, who according to the terms of the sale gets to live on the property until he dies.
"The Playboy Mansion has been a creative center for Hef as his residence and workplace for the past 40 years, as it will continue to be if the property is sold," said Playboy Enterprises' CEO, Scott Flanders, in a statement.  
The mansion includes a home theater, a wine cellar and a four-bedroom guest house. It is also one of the few Los Angeles homes with a zoo license - and complementary pet cemetery. 
The listing comes as Playboy Enterprises works to confront a world where pornography of all kinds is easily accessible online. The magazine - founded in 1953 - is no longer profitable, and as part of an effort to reinvent itself, stopped printing photos of completely nude women in October.
The mansion is part of this declining empire, which began in Chicago when Hefner founded the magazine there with an issue that included a centerfold of Marilyn Monroe. 
Playboy Enterprises bought the Los Angeles mansion for just over $1m in 1971. Hefner commuted between the Gothic-Tudor estate and his Chicago mansion before making the west coast his home in the mid-1970s. 
It has been a den of debauchery in the decades since. A-list celebrities are regularly invited into the estate's gates, past the "Playmates at Play" sign, to extravagant parties where alcohol flows freely and scantily clad women abound.
                     There is a rumor that John Lennon put a cigarette out on a Matisse there while separated from Yoko Ono. And in March 2015, Playboy reporters found blueprints that showed tunnels built from the mansion to the homes of celebrities including Jack Nicholson and Kirk Douglas.
While sales of the magazine fall, the mansion is still a destination for Hollywood's A-list. Leonardo DiCaprio, Rihanna and Naomi Campbell attended a party there last year. 
And of course there are the women, mostly blonde, usually in their 20s, who have rotated through the home. Their lives were broadcast into American homes from 2005 to 2010 in the E! reality television series The Girls Next Door.
In recent years, rose-tinted images of 1970s fun that the property once inspired have given way to more sordid tales.
                     Hefner said in 2011 that he paid young women living at the mansion with whom he was sexually involved a $1,000-a-week allowance in cash and held them to a 9pm curfew.
One of Hefner's ex-girlfriends, Izabella St James, wrote in her book Bunny Tales about the mansion's dirty carpets and stained mattresses. 
"Although we all did our best to decorate our rooms and make them homey, the mattresses on our beds were disgusting - old, worn and stained," St James wrote. "The sheets were past their best too."
Then there was the health scare in February 2011, when more than 100 people fell ill after a party at the mansion. Health authorities said it may have been caused by bacteria identified in the whirlpool spa.
And in the last year, the mansion has been mentioned repeatedly as women come forward to accuse Bill Cosby of sex abuse. Several of the accusers have said they either met Cosby at the mansion or suffered abuse after being drugged at parties there. 
Holly Madison, who was once Hefner's "Girlfriend No 1", wrote in Down the Rabbit Hole that she contemplated suicide while living at the estate.
"Everyone thinks that the infamous metal gate was meant to keep people out," Madison said. "But I grew to feel it was meant to lock me in."

HMRC chief Lin Homer to step down; 
Head of HM Revenue and Customs quits after fierce criticism from MPs over failure to answer 12m tax phonecalls and furore over lenient settlements.

Sean Farrell and Rob Davies.

The chief executive of HM Revenue and Customs is to step down after four years in which she faced fierce criticism over a failure to answer millions of calls from the public and the HSBC tax scandal.
Lin Homer will step down in April following a 36-year public sector career. Despite her resignation, she is still expected to appear before MPs on Wednesday when members of the public accounts committee (PAC) will question her about HMRC's failure to prosecute more tax evaders.
Her resignation prompted a mixed reaction from senior politicians. Labour's Margaret Hodge, who was one of Homer's leading critics while heading the PAC, wrote on Twitter: " Lin Homer retiring at 58? Always polite and solid performer at PAC but presided over awful service to public, huge tax gap and poor morale." 
Chancellor George Osborne praised her contribution, just weeks after she was made a dame in the New Year's honours list.
 "Lin Homer has made a real contribution to public service modernisation and transformation. She has put the foundations in place that will see HMRC become one of the most digitally-advanced tax authorities in the world," he said.
The government said Homer had achieved a record increase in total revenues and reduced error and fraud in tax credits.
Compliance revenues - income from people who have tried not to pay their taxes - grew by 43% to £26.3bn under her tenure. And prosecutions more than doubled from 545 to 1,288, leading to a total of 407 years of prison sentences.
However, Homer has also been the subject of political controversy during her tenure. She revealed last February that most UK clients of HSBC's Swiss business who settled with the tax authorities did so under an extraordinarily lenient agreement.
She said the taxpayer had got a good deal from the settlements but the fact that only one account holder faced prosecution was described as a "miserable result" by predecessor Dave Hartnett.
Homer also apologised in November after HMRC's giant call centre failed to answer a quarter of the 50m calls it received each year. A month later the rate recovered to 90% of calls answered.
In the same month, she angered public sector unions after welcoming reforms in November which will close dozens of local Revenue offices across Britain.
Homer joined HMRC in January 2012 from the Department for Transport, taking charge of an organisation with 56,000 staff and a budget of £3.5bn a year. In the year to the end of March 2015 her total remuneration was £270,000-£275,000, taking into account bonus and pension.
                     HMRC has already begun looking for a successor. While Homer is understood to be free from any contractual obligations limiting where she can work next, she said she would take a break over the summer before seeking a new job.

The decision appears to have been taken with the career path of her predecessor in mind. Hartnett, who faced criticism for signing off on lenient "sweetheart" deals on tax with firms including Goldman Sachs, moved to HSBC less than a year after leaving HMRC.
He defended the decision by saying he had joined to help "put things right" at the bank but the move put him in the awkward position of working for a firm at the centre of a major investigation into tax avoidance by holders of Swiss accounts.
In a statement issued through HMRC, Homer said: "I will be fully sensitive to the responsibility and care that senior HMRC officials should take when considering the appropriateness of potential roles and organisations."
One of her last moves as HMRC chief was to set up a taskforce aimed at cracking down on tax avoidance in the adult entertainment industry, including lap-dancing clubs and escort agencies. 
Responding to Homer's decision to step down, Mark Serwotka, the head of PCS, said: "We do not believe Lin Homer has been a force for good at HMRC and she leaves a department wracked by low staff morale, a highly politicised senior civil service and with industrial relations the worst we have ever known. 
"Her departure is an opportunity to put these things right and we hope this initiative is seized, so we can work with senior officials to rebuild trust."
The Treasury committee chairman, Andrew Tyrie MP, lauded Homer but said HMRC was still in need of a major upgrade. "Lin has done a tough job in difficult circumstances," he said. "It is now very important that the government finds a high-quality replacement. The taxpayer experience of HMRC is still well short of what they have the right to expect. The committee will want to hold a pre-appointment hearing with her successor."
Homer was also accused of a "catastrophic leadership failure" when in charge of the UK Border Agency.
In 2013, the home affairs select committee examined her leadership of the Border Agency and concluded that she had repeatedly misled them for years over the size of the backlogs in asylum and immigration. Describing the system as "chaotic", the MPs said the backlog would take 24 years to clear at the current rate of progress. Homer denied misleading MPs.

Swedish police accused of covering up sex attacks by refugees at music festival; 
PM says police report's failure to mention incidents at 2014 event amounts to 'double betrayal', while reports emerge on New Year's Eve attacks in Malmˆ.

David Crouch in Gothenburg.

Sweden's prime minister has condemned a "double betrayal" of women after allegations that police covered up sexual harassment by recent immigrants at a music festival in Stockholm. Meanwhile, reports have emerged of attacks on women in Malmˆ on New Year's Eve.
Groups of refugees molested concertgoers at We Are Stockholm, Europe's largest youth festival, in the summer of 2014, according to internal police memos obtained by Dagens Nyheter, a daily newspaper. 
"These are so-called refugee youths, specifically from Afghanistan. Several of the gang were arrested for sexual molestation," one police memo said.
Yet the official police report on the five-day festival attended by 170,000 young people aged mainly 13-19 made no mention of sexual harassment or assaults. 
The prime minister, Stefan Lˆfven, said this amounted to a double betrayal since no one was prosecuted for the crimes and the police did not make them public.
The reports come as police in Cologne, Germany, investigate hundreds of claims of assaults on women on New Year's Eve. Officials say nearly all of the suspects in the attacks were "people with an immigrant background". Police and the media have been accused of deliberately under-reporting the events in order not to encourage anti-immigrant sentiment.
In the Stockholm case, an anti-immigrant website linked to the far right Sweden Democrats, Nyeter Idag, claimed that Dagens Nyheter itself received reports about the assaults very soon after the festival but did not publicise them because they might benefit the far-right party, who campaign to stop immigration. Dagens Nyheter vehemently denied the claim, producing a full rebuttal on their website. 
The festival took place a month before general elections in which the Sweden Democrats came third. 
During the 2014 festival, organisers picked up on rumours of a new phenomenon, said Roger Ticoalu, head of events at the Stockholm city administration. 
"It was a modus operandi that we had never seen before: large groups of young men who surround girls and molest them," Ticoalu said. "In the cases where we were able to apprehend suspects, they were with a foreign background, newly arrived refugees aged 17-20, who had come to Sweden without their families."
He said festival organisers did not have enough facts at the time to say anything definitive, and it would have been "totally irresponsible on our side to make anything public". After the festival the organisers launched a programme with police and NGOs to encourage girls and young women to report harassment and to identify culprits, he said.
There were 20 reports of assault or harassment at the festival in 2015, Ticoalu said, but no evidence of any ethnic dimension to the attackers.

Disgraced athletics chief's son 'arranged parcels' for senior IOC members; 
∑ Exclusive: Leaked emails suggest Papa Massata Diack involved in scheme ∑ Emails were sent during period when Qatar was bidding for 2016 Games.

Owen Gibson.

Papa Massata Diack, the son of the former IAAF president, Lamine Diack, was apparently involved in a scheme to deliver "parcels" to influential members of the International Olympic Committee, according to leaked emails seen by the Guardian.
The former IAAF marketing consultant was last week banned for life by the independent IAAF ethics committee over corruption and cover-up allegations linked to Russian doping.
In December 2014, the Guardian revealed that Papa Massata Diack had appeared to request almost $5m from Qatar at a time when Doha was bidding for the 2017 world athletics championships and the Olympic Games. Through the IAAF, Papa Massata Diack denied "ever acting in such a manner".

Another explosive email seen by the Guardian now suggests that three years earlier he had a cryptic exchange with a Qatari business executive in which he made repeated reference to a "Special Adviser", who IAAF sources suggested was likely to be his father Lamine.
"As you know the Special Adviser went to Beijing especially to see his friends in the EXCO and to make sure that all the verbal discussions he had with them and some through his consultants are fully guaranteed," he said in the email.
The email goes on to suggest that six individuals, referred to only by their initials but corresponding with six members of the IOC at the time, had requested "to have their parcels delivered through Special Adviser in Monaco".
"Our special adviser insisted that we do not compromise his credibility with his people and don't dragging him in the negative attitudes created in Beijing [sic]," it added.
                     Diack Sr was arrested by French police  in November over allegations that he had accepted "more than (EURO)1m" in order to cover up positive drug tests, along with the former IAAF legal adviser Habib CissÈ and Gabriel DollÈ, the former head of the IAAF's anti-doping unit.
French prosecutors said that Papa Massata Diack, who is believed to be in Senegal, would also be arrested if he set foot in the country. The email seen by the Guardian details the urgency of complying with the request, saying that one parcel was to be delivered personally by Papa Massata Diack in Lugano, Switzerland, and the rest by the Special Adviser.
It is apparently dated May 2008, when Qatar was in the midst of lobbying to host the 2016 Olympic Games. It was sent two months after an IAAF event in Beijing and shortly before a Super Grand Prix in Doha.
That was during a period when Qatar was in the early stages of bidding for a huge array of sports events as part of an attempt to vault on to the world stage.
In November 2007, it had been awarded the 2010 world indoor championships and in June 2009 Doha would be one of the last cities added to the calendar for the nascent Diamond League,  the IAAF competition that began in 2010.
In June 2008, a month after the email was sent, Doha was dropped from the list of contenders to host the 2016 Olympics at the shortlisting stage. Despite scoring more highly in the technical evaluation than the eventual winners Rio, Doha was dropped because it planned to hold the Games in October - much to the fury of bid leaders.
The email goes on to discuss a meeting apparently between the Special Adviser and a high-ranking Qatari official in the Negresco - a famous upmarket hotel in Nice - and a framework agreed under a contract with Pamodzi, Papa Massata Diack's sports marketing company.
Papa Massata Diack apparently says the high-ranking Qatari official should be available to meet the Special Adviser in Monaco if he has any concerns or doubts. The email appears to have been forwarded by Papa Massata Diack to another Qatari official more than two years later - perhaps as a reminder or a prompt. The apparent link to the IOC could prove damaging for an organisation regularly depicted as having reformed itself in the wake of  the 1998 Salt Lake City scandal, in which the team bidding for the 2002 Winter Olympics was found to have paid bribes and inducements to IOC members on an industrial scale.
An IOC spokesman defended its track record and pointed to its independent ethics commission. "The IOC has an independent ethics commission consisting of a majority of independent personalities coming from the highest levels of the juridical, political or business world. It has a track record of taking firm action based on evidence provided," said the spokesman.
"In the current IAAF case, the IOC took immediate action issuing a provisional suspension against the former IAAF President Lamine Diack immediately after the first evidence against him was provided to the IOC. Following this provisional suspension, the next day, Mr Lamine Diack resigned from his IOC Honorary Membership."

He added: "We would therefore ask you to provide any evidence of wrongdoing by named individuals to us so that it can be pursued. You will appreciate it is difficult to comment on allegations based on extracts from unseen emails. The IOC has consistently had a zero tolerance policy on issues threatening the integrity of sport. A number of measures have been put in place over the last decade and the Olympic Agenda 2020  reforms approved unanimously by the IOC in December 2014 adopted the latest internationally accepted standards of good governance."
The IAAF, understood to feel constrained by the ongoing French criminal investigation over what it can say in public, declined to comment. Papa Massata Diack did not respond to requests for comment.
The Qatar Athletics Federation said it could not comment on the content of the emails without seeing them but again reiterated that its ambitious bidding spree for world sporting events was above board.
"As you are aware, Qatar is very committed to sports, and to the role that sport can play in the development of our nation. The World Athletic Championships in 2019 is an example of this commitment. Our successful bid for that event was based upon a careful evaluation of our nation's ability to host such a prestigious tournament," said a spokesman.
He added: "When we bid to host the 2019 World Athletic Championships we promised that it would be an extraordinary event. We made a similar promise when we bid to host World Cup 2022. We won both bids fair and square, and we look forward to welcoming athletes and spectators from around the world to a spectacular World Athletic Championships in 2019 and an amazing World Cup in 2022."
Until September 2015, Papa Massata Diack had a consultancy contract with the IAAF. Under the agreement, in force since 2007, he was given a mandate to search for potential commercial clients in emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia, India, China, UAE, Qatar, South Korea, Mexico and the Caribbean.
After also being accused by the French newspaper L'Equipe and the German broadcaster ARD of facilitating payments to cover up failed drug tests, Papa Massata Diack agreed to stand down from his role as an IAAF consultant. But in July, he went on the attack, accusing his critics of attempting to undermine him at a time when his father was planning to stand down as the IAAF president.
"Through the defamation of an African sports executive, who happens to be called Diack is not there an attempt to attack indirectly the President of the IAAF?" he wrote in a letter to his father, the IAAF Council and the media.
He added: "To those who criticize me for being President Lamine Diack's son, I will answer that indeed he is my father, a man for whom I have tremendous admiration for being one of the first African sports administrators to lead sport globally. He is my father, but during our professional relationship he has always treated me as he did with any other member of the IAAF team."
In an interview with the BBC in December 2015, Diack Jr insisted he had not been involved in any scheme to extort money from athletes, as alleged.
"I deal with corporate sponsors, I deal with governments, I deal with municipal government, I deal with Olympic committees, I never dealt with any athlete or any agent, so I reject those allegations," he said.
He also rejected the suggestion that he had asked for money from Qatar in 2011.
"I have a very longstanding relationship with Qatar that dates to 1995, so I don't need to send an email when I need something from Qatar," he told the BBC. "I have all the right people's contacts and I can go straight to them. So I reject it totally."
Diack Sr also defended his son in August at his final press conference as IAAF president before handing over to Sebastian Coe. His successor, who was an IAAF vice president for eight years beneath Diack, has been left to deal with a spiralling crisis in the sport. An independent report commissioned by Wada has revealed state-sponsored doping by Russia on an industrial scale.
The second part of the report, to be published this week, will deal with associated "corruption and bribery practices at the highest levels of international athletics".

Lawyers representing Papa Massata Diack, the former president of the Russian athletics federation and the ex-IAAF treasurer Valentin Balakhnichev, DollÈ and Alexei Melnikov, the Russian former head coach for long-distance runners and walkers, in December faced an IAAF ethics committee in London, following an 18-month investigation led by Michael Beloff QC.
An investigation against a fifth person, believed to be CissÈ, is ongoing.
Coe is limited on what he can say on the corruption allegations by the ongoing French criminal investigation but has vowed to reform the organisation.
"If you're saying to me that too much power sat in the hands of too few people and the walls were too high then yes, you're right," he told the BBC last month. He has described the allegations against Diack as "abhorrent" if proved.

Swedish police accused of covering up sex attacks by refugees at music festival;

A couple of hundred men, described as "unaccompanied from Afghanistan", were involved in what was "a new phenomenon", a police spokesperson told the Sydsvenskan newspaper. No women made a formal complaint, police said.
Police in Cologne, Germany, are investigating hundreds of claims of assaults on women on New Year's Eve, and officials say nearly all of the suspects in those attacks were "people with an immigrant background".
Early media coverage of the Cologne attacks was heavily criticised, with the police and media accused of deliberately under-reporting events in order not to encourage anti-immigrant sentiment.
Susanna Udvardi, director of the South-east SkÂne Women's Shelter, who has also led volunteer efforts to help refugees integrate in southern Sweden, said: "Vulgar and demeaning treatment of women, including serious harassment, is far from the reserve of immigrant men from the Middle East.
"I am dismayed by how simplistic the climate of debate in Sweden has become. Most refugees have enormous respect for women."

 Afternoon summary  

David Cameron has made it clear that civil servants will not be allowed to help ministers who want to make the case for Britain leaving the European Union. He set this out in a letter listing four rules that will apply to ministers who want to campaign for Brexit. (See 4.17pm.)

Sir Paul Kenny, the leader of the GM, has told Jeremy Corbyn his union will fight to ensure the Labour party maintains its support for the Trident nuclear weapons programme.

Lord Mendelsohn, a shadow business minister, has told peers that the trade union bill is an attempt to "defenestrate the Labour party's finances". Speaking in a Lords debate on behalf of Labour, he said:
This bill is unworthy of how politics in this country should be conducted. The government's clear attempts to defenestrate the Labour party's finances not just breaches the longstanding agreement that any measures which have a bearing on the finances and the capabilities of a party should only be [introduced] by agreement with all the other parties, but has led to the most ludicrous denials I have ever heard. This is not about party funding, it is said. Is this really plausible after this has been a repeated topic of discussion during rounds of party funding discussions?

Ipsos MORI has published a poll showing that senior business leaders working for major companies strongly favour Britain staying in the EU. Here is an extract from the news release.
The findings, from Ipsos MORI's " Captains of Industry", a survey of more than 100 of the most senior figures in top UK companies, show most think continuing EU membership would be best for their business (87%), are personally hoping for a "stay" result in the forthcoming referendum (87%) and would themselves vote to stay in (83%) if there was a referendum tomorrow.
The clear stance of business leaders contrasts with the more mixed views of the wider public, and appears to be driven by concerns about the impact a vote to leave the EU would have on various aspects of trade, business and the economy. A clear majority (79%) consider that Brexit would have a negative effect on Britain's trade with Europe. Over three-quarters predict a negative effect on the British economy overall (78%), on foreign investment in the UK (78%) and on Britain's standing in the world (72%). 
There is less concern about direct negative effects on their company, such as its prospects (76% predict no impact) or ability to attract and retain talented employees (61% say it would make no difference). Additionally, only minority (37%) think a vote to leave would negatively affect trade with the rest of the world. More believe that an exit vote would make no difference (49%). Only 13% think that it would have a positive effect on non-EU trade.
That's all from me for today.
Thanks for the comments.

 Cameron publishes 4 rules for ministers who want to campaign for Brexit  
Number 10 has just released a three-page open letter from David Cameron to ministers setting out the rules that will underpin his decision to allow them a free vote in the EU referendum. He set out four basic guidelines.
 1 - Collective cabinet responsibility will continue to apply until the EU renegotiation is concluded. During this period, "all ministers should continue to support the position set out in our manifesto and say or do nothing that will undermine the govenrment's negotiating position."
 2 - Ministers will only be free to dissent on the issue of staying in the EU or leaving.  On all other EU-related matters, cabinet responsibility will apply.
All other EU or EU-related business, including negotiations in or with all EU institutions and other member states, and debates and votes in parliament here on EU business will continue to be subject to the normal rules of collective responsibility and party discipline.
Ministers who speak from the frontbench will be expected to support government policy. But "we need to be flexible and apply common sense", Cameron said.
Ministers who choose to depart from the government's recommendation [to stay in the EU, assuming that is what it is] because of long-standing and sincerely held views will not be expected directly to contradict such a position while otherwise defending government policy in parliament.
This implies that Outist ministers will not be allowed to make the case for leaving the EU from the Despatch Box.
 3 - Civil servants will not be able to help ministers who want to make the case for leaving the EU. 
It will not be appropriate or permissible for the civil service or individual civil servants to support ministers who oppose the government's official position by providing briefings or speech material on this matter.
Until the last 28 days of the campaign special advisers will be able to help ministers make the case for leaving the EU, provided they want to help and that they are doing so "in their own time". During the last 28 days separate purdah rules will apply governing what they can do.
 4 - Ministers will be expected to treat each other with courtesy. 
It will be very important during this period for ministers on both sides of the debate to treat each other with appropriate respect and courtesy.
Cameron said he hoped the government would remain "a united, harmonious, mutually respectful team".

 Peers start debating the trade union bill  
In the House of Lords Lady Neville-Rolfe, a business minister and a former civil servant, has opened the second reading debate on the trade union bill. She started by saying unions had a valuable role to play. But reform was necessary, she said.
Every great social institution requires occasional modernisation if it is to remain relevant and responsive... Every institution can benefit from greater transparency, better accountability and clearer regulation. This bill seeks to modernise trade unions, not to undermine their place in society, but to strengthen it by making sure that they are accountable, transparent and use their powers responsibly.
It is not fair that a strike in the education sector in 2014, organised by the National Union of Teachers, was held on the support of just 22% of their members. Similarly in 2014 a strike amongst NHS workers was called by Unite on the basis of the support of just 12% of members.

 GMB boss tells Corbyn unions will fiercely oppose his attempt to change Labour policy on Trident  
 Sir Paul Kenny, the outgoing general secretary of the GMB union, has just been on the World at One telling Jeremy Corbyn that he might have to think again if he wants to commit the Labour party to unilateral disarmament. Here are the key points.

Kenny indicated that the GMB union would fiercely oppose any attempt by Corbyn to abandon Labour's commitment to Trident.

Kenny said the GMB would oppose any attempt by Corbyn to change Labour policy making rules in the hope of getting the party to endorse unilateral disarmament. On the Today programme this morning Corbyn confirmed that he was considering this option. But Kenny said that Corbyn could not bypass existing rules and procedures.
The Labour party policy at the moment, reaffirmed at the party conference recently, is the renewal of Trident. Jeremy is perfectly entitled to say he wants to change that policy. He needs to go through the same democratic process that arrived at that policy in the first place...
There are rules. This isssue of a mandate: I don't remember any speech anywhere where someone said 'I'm standing on a platform that I will do what I want, when I want, irrespective of what the rules of the Labour party are'. So let's just get back to the basics.
Of course people are entitled to want to change policy. Why not? That is how it evolves. But there is a process and there are rules. And if anybody thinks that unions like the GMB are going to go quietly into the night while tens of thousands of our members' jobs are literally Swaneed away by rhetoric, then they've got another shock coming.
(Kenny deserves credit for a particularly creative use of the word Swanee.)

He said the GMB would soon be helping to organise a conference to highlight the tens of thousands of jobs that would be lost if Trident renewal did not go ahead.
There are tens of thousands of British jobs involved here, and British workers. We are going to call a conference. There are about 50 sites around the UK whose livelihoods depend on defence contracts. We are going to ask those people what they think about the Labour party effectively shutting down their jobs. We want their voices heard in this debate.

 Lunchtime summary  

<strong>Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, has been hit by a fresh resignation from his frontbench. The shadow attorney general, Catherine McKinnell, has resigned from Labour's frontbench, citing "concerns about the direction and internal conflict" within the party.

<strong>Corbyn has cleared the way for Labour party members to be given a decisive role in whether to change policy on the Trident nuclear weapons programme in a move that would downgrade the role of the party conference and the shadow cabinet.

<strong>Corbyn has refused to rule out authorising drone strikes to kill jihadis.<strong /> (See 9.45am.)

<strong>Cameron has announced an extension of his national citizen service programme. He did so in a well-trailed and substantial speech on life chances which also confirmed plans to rebuild 100 "sink estates", to promote parenting classes, and to improve perinatal mental health services, and included new plans for a mentoring programme for under-performing teenagers. (See 11.29am,12.32pm and 12.39pm.) I will post more from the speech when I have seen the full text.

<strong>Cameron has urged junior doctors to call off tomorrow's strike. He said:
This strike is not necessary, it will be damaging. We are doing everything we can to mitigate its effects but you cant have a strike on this scale in our NHS without their being some real difficulties for patients and potentially worse.  The Royal Air Force has used Brimstone missiles against Isis in Syria for the first time, Downing Street has confirmed.  Four Brimstone missiles were deployed on two missions on Sunday. As Frances Perraudin and Ewen MacAskill report, one missile was used against enemy positions near Raqqa, including targeting an Isis vehicle. Three Brimstone missiles were also used in an attack on the Omar oilfield on the same day. There were also three other RAF missions in Syria on Sunday that did not use Brimstone missiles, including striking enemy tunnels near Raqqa. Bombing Syria may please allies, but will have little effect on Isis Read moreThe prime minister's spokeswoman declined to say whether the strikes had resulted in casualties, saying: "These will all have been focused on either targeting Daesh [Isis]'s resources or targeting Daesh terrorists who are seeking to destabilise Iraq, Syria and threatening other countries."

The chief executive of HM Revenue and Customs, Lin Homer, is leaving the role after four years in which she faced fierce criticism over HMRC's failure to answer millions of calls from the public and its handling of the HSBC tax scandal.

Jim Shannon, a Democratic Unionist MP who for two years in a row has claimed the most expenses in the House of Commons is being investigated by a parliamentary watchdog. As Henry McDonald reports, the MP for Strangford in Northern Ireland, was paid a total of £205,798 in taxpayer-funded expenses last year, excluding travel.The rare formal investigation by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority's compliance officer, Peter Davis, concerns a claim made by Shannon in relation to travel and subsistence. Davis said no further details of the alleged wrongdoing would be published until the investigation had been concluded.

Peter Robinson has stood down as first minister of Northern Ireland saying he is leaving the job confident that devolution has been secured for generations to come. In his his final speech from the Northern Ireland assembly's frontbench ahead of handing over to Arlene Foster, Robinson said:
When we take a step back and with the perspective of history we can see just how far we have come. We now live in a new era. You only have to look around to see the progress that there has been, not just in the physical structures that didn't exist a decade ago, but in the lives of our people. 
Though we don't always fully appreciate it, devolution underpins the level of peace and stability we enjoy today. After 35 years of stop-go government, devolution, with local people taking the decisions, is once again the norm. 
That has allowed us the platform to recast Northern Ireland's international image and to bring in more jobs than at any point in our history. Whereas once tourists avoided coming here we now attract people from all over the world.
I hereby resign the office of first minister with confidence that the political institutions we have together created will be here for generations to come.
Among those paying tribute to him was Martin McGuinness, the Sinn Fein deputy first minister. McGuinness said:
We faced many challenges and many difficulties but I think we came through in the end. I had a friendship with Ian Paisley until the day he died and I have no doubt I have a friendship with Peter which will exist until the day we both die.

 Cameron announces mentoring scheme for under-achieving teenagers  
In his speech David Cameron also announced a mentoring scheme to help teenagers at risk of under-achieving. Here is an extract from the Number 10 news release about this.
A new generation of high-flying mentors will be created to help struggling teens fulfil their potential and improve their life chances - Prime Minister David Cameron announced today.
Christine Hodgson, chair of Capgemini UK and The Careers & Enterprise Company, has agreed to lead a major campaign to encourage business people and professionals to volunteer to act as mentors to young teens at risk of dropping out of education or achieving less than they could.
While figures for young people not in education, training or employment (NEET) have fallen since 2010 - with numbers now at the lowest levels since records began - there are still tens of thousands of teenagers who are at risk of falling through the cracks.
Alongside this many bright children from disadvantaged backgrounds are not fulfilling their potential with figures showing pupils who score highly in primary school often struggle to continue that success into secondary school.
Around 25,000 pupils about to begin GCSEs risk under-achieving or dropping out: many of these would benefit from a mentor and the campaign will aim to ensure that they are not denied that support because no suitable mentors are available. 
The national mentoring campaign will see schools and businesses encouraged to work together to give these young people the best possible chance to succeed in later life.

 Full text of Catherine McKinnell's resignation letter  
Here is the full text of Catherine McKinnell's resignation letter (for anyone having difficulty reading the picture she posted on Twitter.)
Dear Jeremy,
I was genuinely surprised to be asked to join your shadow cabinet as shadow attorney general last September, however, I instantly acknowledged my duty to serve and the honour of doing so.
Whilst I did not support you for the leadership election, I recognised the significant mandate you had won from all sections of the party and was of course proud to be a member of a shadow cabinet that - for the first time ever - had a majority of women.
I also have huge respect for you personally as someone who has stood by their principles over many years and done so with decency and respect for those with whom you did not agree. I therefore thank you for giving me the opportunity to be part of your team. 
Since my election as the MP for Newcastle North in 2010, I have worked hard to represent my constituents both in Newcastle and in Westminster whilst juggling the demands of having young children and living in two different places.
I am the first to recognise that many parents and carers up and down the country are also balancing work with family life, However, there are three reasons why this situation has become more difficult for me since returning to parliament after the election in May.
As you know, I had my third child twelve months ago and have spend this past year combining care for him with both a general election campaign and then returning to parliament, including taking on the additional responsibility of a shadow cabinet post. The logistics of managing family life in Newcastle with my work down in Westminster have inevitably become more of a challenge.
The second is the reality of being a shadow cabinet member. Whilst this is of course a huge honour and privilege, it is perhaps not generally understood that this precludes an MP from speaking up in Parliament on issues outside their brief. Whilst I have been able to use my position to raise concerns about issues such as corporate criminal liability, serious economic crime, prosecution rates, legal aid, and access to justice, I have found it increasingly difficult not to be able to speak up in the Commons about other matters that are of huge importance to my constituents in Newcastle North. 
Both of these issues are amplified by a third factor - the situation in which the Labour party now finds itself. As somebody who came into politics with the sole motivation of making life better for my city, my region and, by extension, the country as a whole, I recognised that our electoral defeats in both 2010 and 2015 demanded a genuine and profound response from the Labour party. I therefore shared your optimism for the 'new kind of politics' you spoke so compellingly about.
However, as events have unfolded over recent weeks, my concerns about the direction and internal conflict within the Labour party have only grown, and I fear this is taking us down an increasingly negative path. I feel that I would like to channel my energy constructively, into making positive changes for my constituency.
Therefore, having given this much consideration over the weekend, I have reached the conclusion that I can better serve my constituents and the Labour party from the backbenches at this time, and with a heavy heart I resign from my post within your shadow cabinet.
Yours sincerely,
Catherine McKinnell

 McKinnell says she fears Labour is 'going down an increasingly negative path'  
In her resignation letter Catherine McKinnell said there were three reasons why she wanted to resign from the shadow cabinet.
She said that birth of her third child 12 months ago had made managing family life harder and that she found it frustrating not being able to speak out on constituency issues because of her shadow cabinet role.
But there was a third factor, she said - her concern about the direction in which the party was heading under Jeremy Corbyn.
As somebody who came into politics with the sole motivation of making life better for my city, my region and, by extension, the country as a whole, I recognised that our electoral defeats in both 2010 and 2015 demanded a genuine and profound response from the Labour party.

In the House of Lords today peers will debate the second reading of the trade union bill. As the Guardian's splash reports, Labour thinks the proposals in the bill to replace the current "opt out" system for people paying a levy into a union's political fund with an "opt in" system will cost the party £6m a year.
 Related:  Tories undermining Labour funding with 'partisan' trade union bill
The Lib Dems are also arguing that this is unfair. Normally peers do not vote on a bill at second reading, but Lord Tyler, the Lib Dem constitutional affairs spokesman, has tabled an amendment saying part of the bill should be considered by a select committee. This would delay consideration of the bill.
The Lib Dems say the committee on standards in public life proposed two key reforms to party funding laws in a report in 2011: a cap on individual donations, which was particularly hit the Tories; and an opt-in rule for union political funds, which would particularly hit Labour. The committee said its plans should be considered "as a package" because implementing one recommendation, but not the other, would be unfair. But this is exactly what the government is doing, the Lib Dems say. Tyler will highlight this point in the debate.
In a statement Tyler said:
Whatever your political background it is clear that this move is unfair, undemocratic and sets a dangerous precedent.
The Tories are manipulating the system unilaterally so they can hold on to power for years to come.
We are calling on the government to fulfil their past promises, to act in the public interest; they have to stop pulling strings behind the scenes to silence their opponents.
It is not clear, though, whether the Tyler amendment will actually be put to a vote. Votes at second reading in the Lords are very rare and Tyler may decide that it is more fruitful to push this point to a division at a later stage in the bill's passage through the Lords.

 Jeremy Corbyn's Today interview - Summary  
Jeremy Corbyn has had some praise for his Today programme interview. I will post a round-up shortly. But first here are the main news points..

Corbyn refused to rule out authorising drone strikes to kill jihadis. He sounded quite sceptical (no one will have come away from the interview feeling that he was itching to pull the trigger), but he did sound notably more open to the idea of authorising a strike like the one that killed the Britons in August than he has in previous interviews when he has questioned the whole legality of attacks like this. This is what he said when asked if he would authorise a drone strike to kill the jihadi in the recent Islamic State video showing five hostages being killed.
I think that's a hypothetical question. You have to look at the sources of the support of Isil, you have to look at the way it gets its money, the way it gets its weapons.
When pressed on this, he went on:
I would want to know what the evidence is, what difference it would make by doing that, what the chances were of capturing somebody - I suspect probably very, very low in those circumstances - so action could be taken. 

He said he had still not decided whether Labour's new policy on Trident will be decided by a ballot of all party members. Such a move would bypass the party's established policy making procedure, which involves the national policy forum drawing up policy and it being confirmed at party conference (where trade unions, many of which favour Trident, have 50% of the vote). Last week John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor and a key Corbyn ally, suggested party members would take the decision in a ballot. Corbyn said this was still unresolved. He said he wanted members to have "a big say" but that the details were not finalised.
I want members to have a big say in it. Whether that comes as a vote of individual members, or a vote at conference, that will be decided. I have not made up my mind on that.
But he suggested he was leaning towards a new procedure.
My whole election programme was based on the need for ordinary people to be able to participate much more in politics, so that leaders don't go away and write policy, so that executive groups don't go off and decide what the policy is, ordinary people do. 

He said Labour's new policy on Trident should have supporting the nuclear non-proliferation treaty at its heart.
It has to start from the basis that we are signed up to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, itself a creation of the 1960s Labour government of Harold Wilson, and that there also has to be a policy of what we do to ensure protection of skills and jobs throughout British industry that are in some part reliant on the whole Trident nuclear programme.
But if we want to live in a nuclear-free world, we have to recognise that we have to make a contribution to it. Renewing Trident, in my view, goes against the fundamental spirit of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty which requires the five declared nuclear weapons states not to renew their weapons systems. 

He said he supported the anti-Trident rally being planned for February and did not rule out speaking at it.

Corbyn said that he was "not in favour of terrorism of any sort" and that he did not believe the French government was responsible for the attacks on Paris.
I am absolutely not in favour of terrorism of any sort. It is absolutely appalling and disgraceful that civilian life should be taken by random acts of terrorism as happened in Paris...
Of course the French government were not responsible for the attacks on the streets of Paris any more than any other government was from the West.
But I would just say, listen very carefully to the analysis that President Obama gave of the situation in the Middle East when he said we have to think long and hard about the longer-term effects of both the war in Afghanistan and the war in Iraq, about what that does. We have a terrible situation in Syria, we have a terrible situation developing in Iraq and now sadly getting even worse in Afghanistan. Can we not think very long and hard about what our long-term policies and objectives have to be. 
Corbyn said he agreed with what Pat McFadden said about terrorists being responsible for their behaviour. But he also said he thought McFadden's comments on this in the Commons were distorting what Corbyn thought. He said McFadden was sacked as shadow Europe minister not just because of that, but because of various critical things he had said.

Corbyn said he opposed Saddam Hussein long before many of those who supported the Iraq war.
I was probably opposed to Saddam Hussein long before all those people who supported the war decided they were opposed to him.

He praised Hilary Benn, the shadow foreign secretary, for his "brilliant" performance attacking the government over its relationship with Saudi Arabia. He said he had had very long discussions with Benn during the reshuffle last week during which Benn kept his post, but he would not go into details.

He said British foreign policy should be based on human rights.
We has a country have got to develop a human rights-based foreign policy.

He claimed he did not know who briefed journalists that he intended to move Benn. "I'm not sure where the briefing came from," he said.

Corbyn claimed the reshuffle had made his frontbench team more representative of the country and of the parliamentary Labour party. He particularly highlighted two junior appointments as important: Emma Lewell-Buck taking responsibility for campaigning in the north; and Kate Osamor taking on equalities role

He said he supported junior doctors' strike.
We should recognise that junior doctors are qualified, extremely hard working, deserve to be treated properly, and Jeremy Hunt should now come to an agreement with them. 

He brushed aside the claim that he is not capable of winning over voters who do not already agree with him.
Somewhere along the line I've managed to be reelected eight times in my constituency, with very large majorities. I started off with a very small majority. I managed to receive the support of 250,000 members and supporters of the party during the leadership election. I realise that's not the public. 
But I just say this. If we carry on like this in this county, we end up with a more divided Britain, we end up with more people sleeping homeless, we end up with more young people in overcrowded accommodation, underachieving at school. We have a housing strategy that denies opportunity for everybody. Middle-class families whose children cannot leave because they cannot afford to buy anywhere, poorer families cannot get any council housing, forced into very expensive private rented accommodation. We can, will and must do things very differently. 

He paid tribute to David Bowie.
I think that it is great that we are spending time remembering a great musician, a great entertainer and someone that represents all that's best in the fantastic cultural diversity of this country. I can't think of David Bowie without thinking Life on Mars.

Q: Do you support the junior doctors' strike?
Corbyn says he has sent a message of support to them. There is no strike in Wales or Scotland, he says.
Q: Do you understand why people worry that Labour won't win if you are going to war with your party?
Corbyn says he does not want to go to war with anyone. He wants to offer a different approach to the economy. He has defeated the government on police cuts, on tax credits, and on the prison contract for Saudi Arabia.
Q: People wonder if you can win over people who are not Labour supporters. I have known you for years. You like protesting. You don't seem interested in talking to people who do not agree with you. People will say you cannot even persuade Labour colleagues to agree with you.
Corbyn says if we go on as we are going now, Britain will be more divided, inequality will get worse and more people will not be able to get housing. We need an alternative, he says.
And that's it. I will post a summary soon.
block-time published-time 8.29am GMT 
Q: A recent poll said fewer than one in five voters trust you to keep people safe. You sacked Pat McFadden for saying terrorists are responsible for their actions. Isn't that reasonable?
Corbyn says on the face of it what McFadden said was reasonable. But McFadden had said various critical things.
Q: Was it a distotortion of your views?
In some respects, yes, says Corbyn. Corbyn says he abhors terrorism.
Q: That's not the point. People think that you think France was partly to blame for what happened.
Corbyn says it is important to think about the consequences of foreign policy actions.
He says he wanted a peaceful solution to the Iraq crisis.
Q: If you were told a drone strike could kill the militant seen in the recent Islamic State video, would you approve it?
Corbyn says it is a hypothetical question. He would want to see the evidence.
Q: It is not really hypothetical. You disapprove of drone strikes.
Corbyn says he would want to see the evidence.
block-time published-time 8.25am GMT 
Q: Is it inconceivable that you could stand for election in 2020 on Labour's current policy?
Corbyn says Nick Robinson is suggesting a crisis that does not exist. The Labour party will look at this policy.
Q: There is a big anti-Trident rally in February. Will you speak at it?
Corbyn says he has not been invited yet. But he is supportive of the rally.

 Jeremy Corbyn's Today interview  
Jeremy Corbyn starts with a tribute to David Bowie. He represented the cultural diversity of the UK, he says.
Q: How did the reshuffle make Labour stronger?
Corbyn says he has widened the shadow cabinet, to represent the diversity of the country and of the PLP.
Q: Why did you not move Hilary Benn?
Corbyn says there is huge work for Maria Eagle to do at culture. He says the party has a policy on Trident. But he has a position on Trident too.
Q: Journalists were briefed you wanted to move Benn?
Corbyn says he does not know where that briefing came from.
He had a long chat with Benn. He wants Benn to focus on attacking the government's human rights record.
Q: What will you do to ensure the party adopts your stance on Trident?
Corbyn says there will be a review of policy.
It will start by ensuring Labour backs the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, agreed by Harold Wilson's government.
Q: Will members of the Labour party get a vote on this?
Corbyn says he won't decide this; the national executive committee will decide.
But he wants a debate.
Q: You want members to have a vote?
Corbyn says he wants them to have "a big say". Whether that is through a vote, or through a vote at conference, he has not decided.

Anita Loos - sharp, shameless humour of the 'world's most brilliant woman'; 
The writer of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes was an extraordinary, barbed genius of the silent era, Hollywood and Broadway.

Pamela Hutchinson.

Anita Loos, the screenwriter and author, claimed - in typically waggish style - to be furious at the women's lib movement. "They keep getting up on soapboxes and proclaiming that women are brighter than men," she said. "That's true, but it should be kept very quiet or it ruins the whole racket." Loos was a veteran of silent-era Hollywood, when women worked at all levels of the film industry - directing, editing, producing and designing. Scriptwriting, Loos's forte, was the most feminine department: a "manless Eden" of female screenplay writers, scenario authors, story editors, intertitle artists and "script girls". Loos may not have been the most successful screenwriter during Hollywood's silent years (that honour falls to Frances Marion ), but she was one of its greatest wits, most popular characters and one of its key storytellers.
Loos is best known today for her wickedly funny novel Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, written during her Hollywood years, which follows the escapades of gold-digging, flaxen-haired showgirl Lorelei Lee and her man-mad brunette chum Dorothy. For many, this breathless novel epitomises the highs and the lows of the jazz age, though it's now most famous in its 1953 musical film incarnation starring Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell.  
The book is typical of Loos's sharp and shameless humour: for all that Lorelei appears to be a mercenary and a "dumb blonde", the real butts of the joke are the men who fall for her charms. Loos was inspired to write it when she saw her friend, the literary critic and satirist HL Mencken, lose his cool when faced with a blond beauty.
 Related:  Gentlemen Prefer Blondes | Film Review
Gentlemen Prefer Blondes had been filmed before the musical, in 1928, when its roaring 20s satire would have been even more pointed. Loos, by then a fixture at Paramount, wrote the screenplay (with her husband, John Emerson ) and the intertitles (with Herman Mankiewicz, who would go on to write Citizen Kane ). 
The 1928 Gentlemen Prefer Blondes had impeccable comic credentials, being directed by Keystone alumnus Mal St Clair, and starring two more former employees of Mack Sennett: Ruth Taylor and Ford Sterling. Alice White picked up the part of sidekick Dorothy after Loos nixed the studio's original, and intriguing, choice of Louise Brooks. Brooks is said to have given a joyless performance in her screen test ("I stunk"), and Loos dismissed her, with an offensive turn of phrase that was, sadly, characteristic, saying: "If I ever write a part for a cigar-store Indian, you will get it." The film was something of a flop, and we may never get to judge it for ourselves as it has long been considered lost.
But Loos's Hollywood story began more than a decade before Lorelei first shimmied on to the pages of Harper's magazine, where her novel was originally serialised. As a young woman in California, Loos was an avid moviegoer, long before a trip to the nickelodeon was considered a cultural event. She had strong opinions about which films were better than others and fancied that she could make a fair fist of writing movies herself. 
Aged 24, she posted a short film scenario she had written to DW Griffith 's Biograph studio in New York. Not only did Griffith like The New York Hat, and pay her $25 for it, but the film he made from her story is one of his finest short features. Twenty-year-old Mary Pickford gives a typically nuanced performance in the lead role of a motherless child swept up in small-town scandal, and Lionel Barrymore makes his first screen performance as the local minister whose kindness causes the disgrace. By most people's standards, The New York Hat would be precocious, but the vain Loos so often embroidered the truth that, in the telling of this story, she often claimed to have attained her movie debut as a teenager, even as young as 12 years old. Loos told some of the finest and funniest stories about Hollywood, but many should be taken with a sprinkling of salt.
Loos wrote many more scenarios for Griffith, posting them from her home in San Diego, where she lived with her mother. Some of them he used, but many he considered unfilmable as silent pictures. "The laughs were all in the lines," he complained, "there was no way to get them on to the screen." For that very reason, he gave Loos the prestigious job of writing the intertitles for his epic Intolerance (1916), a vast portmanteau film taking in a contemporary crime drama, the fall of the Babylonian empire, a Bible story and the St Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572. 
Loos's amusing, compact intertitles leaven the film's heavy material with crisp dramatic statements and comical jibes such as: "When women cease to attract men they often turn to Reform as a second choice." Loos had found an excellent way to exploit her natural skill with a one-liner. A year later, Photoplay reported that Griffith had called her "The most brilliant woman in the world", and praised her skilful writing, saying: "The most important service that Anita Loos has so far rendered the screen is the elevation of the subcaption [sic], first to sanity then to dignity and brilliance combined."
Loos became renowned for her cleverness at writing piquant intertitles, first for a series of Douglas Fairbanks 's early films: her verbal wit a match for his physical gags. Four feet 11in tall, with a chic, gamine hairdo and a terribly expensive wardrobe, Loos was a distinctive presence and soon became as famous as many a movie star: the "soubrette of satire". She had a collaborator by this time, the director John Emerson, to whom she was devoted and would later marry, although he was a notorious philanderer and far from her intellectual equal. Loos and Emerson worked as a writer-director team for many years. Emerson often insisted on taking a screenwriting credit when the words were Loos's alone, and there have even been some controversial suggestions that when Emerson was indisposed, Loos took his place behind the camera. When they worked in New York, they stayed at the Algonquin hotel, where Loos was friendly with, though not an insider in, Dorothy Parker's famous Round Table.
Loos spent years as a successful Hollywood screenwriter, at Paramount, United Artists and MGM. She developed a knack for talent spotting, and moved happily into sound films, not least because the witticisms that were confined to titlecards in her silent movies found a home in fast-talking screenplays of the 30s. Fashion-obsessed, gossipy and loyal, she forged last Hollywood friendships with a number of stars, included those she "spotted", from the Talmadge sisters (she wrote a very affectionate biography of them), to Jean Harlow and Paulette Goddard. When Emerson's health failed in 1937, she discovered that he had frittered away much of their income and requested a divorce, realising that after all she would have to make a success of her career alone. And she did.
Loos died in her 90s, in 1981. Her legacy comprises a vast body of silent work, as well as sound-era successes including the sizzling pre-code flick Red-Headed Woman (1932), starring Jean Harlow, and the breakneck cattiness of The Women (1939). She also adapted her Gentlemen Prefer Blondes for a triumphant Broadway musical production starring Carol Channing in 1949, and two years later made a New York sensation of Colette's Gigi, which ran for more than a year, with a young Audrey Hepburn in the lead role.
Much of Loos's writing success came from the fact that she was a born raconteur, the life and soul of many a Hollywood party, with a hawkish eye on the glamorous, or scandalous, events that surrounded her. Hence the pinpoint satire of Lorelei Lee. In one of her biographical volumes, A Girl Like I, Loos wrote that: "I've enjoyed my happiest moments when trailing a Mainbocher evening gown across the sawdust-covered floor of a saloon." Those Hollywood memoirs, while not always to be trusted, are among the most entertaining ever written, because Loos remains great company, and because her story proves how far a young woman in a young industry could get on brains and high spirits alone.

Comedian Lucy Porter will talk on Anita Loos: Hollywood Pioneer at the Slapstick festival in Bristol on 22 January, which includes screenings of The New York Hat and The Mystery of the Leaping Fish. This event will be followed by a screening of the Douglas Fairbanks western Wild and Woolly, which Anita Loos co-wrote. Click here for tickets.

Tory assault on Labour funding ignores its own corruption; 
Labour has debatable donors, too, but a lot of Conservative cash comes from people whose economic activities harm us.

Michael White.

Once in a while the embattled Corbynite world view squares with what's actually happening. Today is such a day - as the House of Lords debates its second reading of David Cameron's trade union bill, as vindictive and partisan a measure as any the unfettered Tory government is likely to produce this side of 2020.
                     I've written about this before. And Monday's Guardian carries a critique of the bill written by Bob Kerslake. Who's he? Head of the home civil service under David Cameron until 2014.
 Related:  I've had bruising encounters with trade unionists, but condemn efforts to silence them 
Lord Kerslake sports a beard and is probably a suspect lefty in Tory eyes - their press pack certainly worked him over. But that does not invalidate his experienced testimony on the importance of trade unions, both to the country - as an important intermediate institution between individuals and the state - and, especially, to the Labour party whose chief donors are unions.
All this would be bad enough were it not for the fact that the real scandal in the funding of British political parties is not the union cash for Labour - it's all out in the open and they are idealistic enough to spend it on Jeremy Corbyn's project - but the very untransparent way the Tories hoover up cash from some pretty debatable characters. That's my focus today.
First that bill. Patrick Wintour warns in the Guardian that the proposed changes to union funding (whereby members must "opt in" to paying the political levy rather than opt out) may cost Labour £6m a year. Wintour and Nicholas Watt provide some background here. Owen Jones weighs in with customary energy on the wider context - boundary redistribution and electoral registration - to detect a systemic plot. Read about the disappearing voters here.
I don't regard a Conservative government as an organised conspiracy against the poor, let alone the majority. That's too glib; it's also patronising.
But governments do foolish things (Dave's does plenty), mostly out of ignorance or naive overconfidence. Sometimes they do destructive things, wrecking delicate structures and balances, a milder form of the temple-wrecking Islamic State's teenage hotheads do after school. The trade union bill is one of those foolish things.
As Kerslake points out, the opt-in change for the political fund is only one of four harsh measures, certainly not justified by the current level of strike militancy - junior doctors and transport workers - which is a pinprick compared to the 60s and 70s. Tory donors do far more harm to society in 2016.
Another is the proposed threshold for turnout and support for strike action, far higher than elections for councils, police commissioners or governments (SNP included) get. Worse, the use of electronic voting will be expressly banned. A third is the power that a minister would acquire to curb union officials' activity in working hours, the fourth a national certification officer who can penalise unions. Both centralising impulses support Kerslake's worry about an "authoritarian" strain in Cameron's make-up. It is his Flashman side that wise advisers (not Sir Lynton "Dog Whistle" Crosby obviously, he's merely crafty) should curb, not encourage.
What about the Tories' money operation? It's a permanent and sleazy scandal which robust papers like the Daily Mail (the Torygraph is more compromised) routinely expose alongside liberal papers like the Guardian, Observer and Indy. The FT and Channel 4 News get stuck in, too.
Here's a starting point on  party funding from the Guardian, another from the Indy and some Channel 4 fact-checking.
The Guardian has also written about other  cuts to funding  for opposition parties, which mean a £1m reduction for Labour, a £200,000 cut for the SNP and £100,000 less for the Lib Dems. The " Short money " is there to fund opposition parties and is vital to the accountable functioning of politics. It's named after Ted Short, a long dead Labour deputy leader, not because they're meant to be short of cash.
Let's look at all that money the Tories get from the City and the hedge fund operators in Mayfair and elsewhere? Here's some LSE research and here's confirmation. Still not persuaded? Try this from the bankers' pink paper. If you can't get behind the FT paywall, the piece is dated 4 February 2015 and called Number of big City backers for Tories doubles. You get my drift.
No party has a monopoly on virtue. Labour sometimes gets questionable donors, too, the Lib Dems took a fat wodge from a fraudster who gave them £2.4m before being jailed (the party didn't give the money back, either). By the same token all parties, Tories included, have donors who give for noble and disinterested reasons. I sometimes meet them. Assorted Sainsburys throw their cash at politics and other good causes: they don't need any favours from government.
But donations buy access, via dinners or "research" sessions, and donations can be parcelled up between family and friends (if you have that kind of cash) in small packages - below £5,000 - to slip under the radar of the Electoral Commission's monitoring. Just read this Daily Mail account. Or this one from the Mirror. Head not spinning yet? How about this then?
 Related:  Ed Miliband hits back at 'tax-avoiding' Boots boss
Yes, I realise they all do it, but it is the scale of the Tory operation coupled with its parallel assault on Labour's "white wine and sandwiches" operation that makes it so scandalous. Throw in the "lobbying act", which hits charities lobbying harder than it does the sleaze balls, and it makes it even worse. 
A lot of donors are engaged in economic activities that do us harm, either by crashing their banks into debts from which the taxpayer has to rescue them or by working for institutions that have diddled their customers through assorted frauds - interest rates or mis-selling - for which their institutions have been heavily fined but no one jailed.
Others engage in financial engineering of real assets, which (sometimes) hurts the poor and vulnerable. Do you remember Stefano Pessina? He was that Boots executive (you remember sold-off Swiss-relocated Boots?) who attacked Ed Miliband. I'm sure he had a point, but do we need to hear from an Italian who lives (for the sunshine, I'm sure) in Monaco?
Time to stop. But two further points. Reform of party funding, long sought by all sides, is stalled because Labour won't concede on union cash ( Miliband's "reforms" on trade union membership of Labour made it more fragile still) when the odds are so heavily stacked against it on City money.
You can find the background in an official Commons library research paper - always good stuff. Democratic Audit offers a wider view, one in which the trend across Europe is towards more state funding, in Britain and (far worse) the US to private, often oligarch, financing of elections.
Last but not least, it is poignant to note that from 1832 onwards British elections got cleaner and the franchise steadily expanded until 1970 (votes at 18). In the 21st century, it's starting to shrink as voter lists get smaller and fewer bother to vote. Corruption will get bolder, too, unless we make more fuss.
Over to you again, unelected peers!

Detroit confronts self-driving cars: can America's auto show survive the future?; 
The North American International Auto Show has reigned for decades as the premiere industry event, but Silicon Valley is threatening the crown.

Benjamin Preston.

An unspoken question hung in the frigid air of Detroit's largest auto show, as work crews fastened the last few bolts and polished down the displays. How long can the North American International Auto Show reign supreme?
 Related:  CES 2016: cars, virtual reality and a lot of hype
For those who like the status quo in the auto industry, these can be unsettling times. Gas prices have hovered at remarkable lows, Silicon Valley giants are breaking into the business and if some criers are to be believed, the revolution of self-driving cars is near. 
Most agree that autonomous driving technology - the stuff of self-driving vehicles  already in testing - is the force most likely to significantly change how people get around. 
The new challenger to the Detroit show's dominion over automotive pageantry is the Consumer Electronic Show (CES), which was held last week at the Las Vegas Convention Center. There were a number of newsworthy unveilings and announcements at CES, ones which in years past would have likely appeared at an actual auto show.
General Motors introduced the production version of its all-electric Bolt. (Last year, the concept was revealed in Detroit.) Volkswagen showed off the BUDD-e, its electric micro-van concept, taking the opportunity to apologize again for having flouted emissions regulations. Ford and Google were rumoured to have announced a partnership  that could speed up the official arrival of fully autonomous cars. General Motors and Lyft, the app-based taxi service, trumpeted a similar plan.
In fact they had not. A Ford statement said: "We have been and will continue working with many companies and discussing a variety of subjects related to our Ford Smart Mobility. We keep these discussions private for obvious competitive reasons, and we do not comment on speculation."
Nonetheless, Ashkay Anand, an analyst for Kelley Blue Book, told the Guardian: "CES has absolutely stolen some of the spotlight in terms of autonomous tech, in part because technology in general and automotive are becoming more and more integrated as time goes on.
"We're at the point where CES is as important to the industry as many of the car shows."
For decades, the Detroit auto show - held each January at the sprawling Cobo Center - has been the premiere North American venue for auto makers around the world to display their latest wares. As the command center of the American auto industry, the midwestern city is ideal for American automakers, even if January isn't the best time to visit a state on the Great Lakes. If event organizers pumping $200m into a new layout (it had been the same for a few years) is any indication, they are not willing to cede the crown without a fight.
"There is an automotive push happening at CES, but when you look at our show, these are the real models that that technology shows up in," Max Muncey, public relations manager for NAIAS, said in an interview. 
"With over 40 model debuts, 90% of which are worldwide, and more than 30 CEOs on the floor, it's a couple of big days."
Accordingly, Detroit will showcase a couple of hi-tech heavyweights of its own. The Volvo S90 T8 Plug-in Hybrid, for example, will show off a semi-autonomous cruise control system in a new flagship sedan produced by the Chinese-owned Swedish company. Mercedes-Benz will be pulling the wraps off the 2017 E-Class sedan, which is expected to be equipped with autonomous components and which made a camouflaged appearance at CES last week.
Kevin DeSouza, a researcher for the Brookings Institute, said piecemeal introduction of autonomous technologies over the past few years - lane departure warning systems, speed-adjusting cruise control and automatic brakes - have made more comprehensive systems possible in what seems like a very short time. 
Automakers, he said, have become more comfortable with the Google model of doing things: introducing tech incrementally. They have also started presenting vehicles as platforms to customize with technology as buyers see fit.

"Normally, emerging technologies are hyped well ahead of their prime time," DeSouza said. "With AVs [autonomous vehicles] we might actually see them on the roads sooner than most people predicted. 
"Technology components that support AVs have already been deployed and tested on our roads, so we did not have to wait to roll out the solutions all at once."
Most of the other introductions in Detroit will be fairly run-of-the-mill: conventional Buicks, Chryslers, Hondas, Fords and the like. The arrival of the Chinese-built Buick Envision, the first of its kind to enter the North American arena, is noteworthy but not an earth-shattering event. 
Bentley, Jaguar, Land Rover, Maserati, Tesla and Rolls-Royce will all eschew the show this year, but since Detroit tends to be a "people's car" sort of event anyway, the luxury marques probably won't go much missed.
But automakers have been known to stun with big surprises, as Ford did last year with its GT supercar debut. For the competitive gamblers out there, it's important to consider that the national average gasoline price, which on Friday dipped below $2 per gallon for the first time since 2009, has been low for a while. The solid bet assumes that any surprises will be more about horsepower and performance than technology and alternative fuels.
It's difficult for anyone to say where auto makers will pour their marketing dollars in a decade's time, or even a few years from now. Anand suggested that Detroit and other events like it have maintained their prominence despite any past or present uncertainty.
"For actual, market-ready product, shows still reign supreme," he said. "For now."

 GMB boss tells Corbyn unions will fiercely oppose his attempt to change Labour policy on Trident  
 Sir Paul Kenny, the outgoing general secretary of the GMB union, has just been on the World at One telling Jeremy Corbyn that he might have to think again if he wants to commit the Labour party to unilateral disarmament. Here are the key points.

Kenny indicated that the GMB union would fiercely oppose any attempt by Corbyn to abandon Labour's commitment to Trident.

Kenny said the GMB would oppose any attempt by Corbyn to change Labour policy making rules in the hope of getting the party to endorse unilateral disarmament. On the Today programme this morning Corbyn confirmed that he was considering this option. But Kenny said that Corbyn could not bypass existing rules and procedures.
The Labour party policy at the moment, reaffirmed at the party conference recently, is the renewal of Trident. Jeremy is perfectly entitled to say he wants to change that policy. He needs to go through the same democratic process that arrived at that policy in the first place...
There are rules. This isssue of a mandate: I don't remember any speech anywhere where someone said 'I'm standing on a platform that I will do what I want, when I want, irrespective of what the rules of the Labour party are'. So let's just get back to the basics.
Of course people are entitled to want to change policy. Why not? That is how it evolves. But there is a process and there are rules. And if anybody thinks that unions like the GMB are going to go quietly into the night while tens of thousands of our members' jobs are literally Swaneed away by rhetoric, then they've got another shock coming.
(Kenny deserves credit for a particularly creative use of the word Swanee.)

He said the GMB would soon be helping to organise a conference to highlight the tens of thousands of jobs that would be lost if Trident renewal did not go ahead.
There are tens of thousands of British jobs involved here, and British workers. We are going to call a conference. There are about 50 sites around the UK whose livelihoods depend on defence contracts. We are going to ask those people what they think about the Labour party effectively shutting down their jobs. We want their voices heard in this debate.

 Lunchtime summary  

<strong>Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, has been hit by a fresh resignation from his frontbench. The shadow attorney general, Catherine McKinnell, has resigned from Labour's frontbench, citing "concerns about the direction and internal conflict" within the party.

<strong>Corbyn has cleared the way for Labour party members to be given a decisive role in whether to change policy on the Trident nuclear weapons programme in a move that would downgrade the role of the party conference and the shadow cabinet.

<strong>Corbyn has refused to rule out authorising drone strikes to kill jihadis.<strong /> (See 9.45am.)

<strong>Cameron has announced an extension of his national citizen service programme. He did so in a well-trailed and substantial speech on life chances which also confirmed plans to rebuild 100 "sink estates", to promote parenting classes, and to improve perinatal mental health services, and included new plans for a mentoring programme for under-performing teenagers. (See 11.29am,12.32pm and 12.39pm.) I will post more from the speech when I have seen the full text.

<strong>Cameron has urged junior doctors to call off tomorrow's strike. He said:
This strike is not necessary, it will be damaging. We are doing everything we can to mitigate its effects but you cant have a strike on this scale in our NHS without their being some real difficulties for patients and potentially worse.  The Royal Air Force has used Brimstone missiles against Isis in Syria for the first time, Downing Street has confirmed.  Four Brimstone missiles were deployed on two missions on Sunday. As Frances Perraudin and Ewen MacAskill report, one missile was used against enemy positions near Raqqa, including targeting an Isis vehicle. Three Brimstone missiles were also used in an attack on the Omar oilfield on the same day. There were also three other RAF missions in Syria on Sunday that did not use Brimstone missiles, including striking enemy tunnels near Raqqa. Bombing Syria may please allies, but will have little effect on Isis Read moreThe prime minister's spokeswoman declined to say whether the strikes had resulted in casualties, saying: "These will all have been focused on either targeting Daesh [Isis]'s resources or targeting Daesh terrorists who are seeking to destabilise Iraq, Syria and threatening other countries."

The chief executive of HM Revenue and Customs, Lin Homer, is leaving the role after four years in which she faced fierce criticism over HMRC's failure to answer millions of calls from the public and its handling of the HSBC tax scandal.

Jim Shannon, a Democratic Unionist MP who for two years in a row has claimed the most expenses in the House of Commons is being investigated by a parliamentary watchdog. As Henry McDonald reports, the MP for Strangford in Northern Ireland, was paid a total of £205,798 in taxpayer-funded expenses last year, excluding travel.The rare formal investigation by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority's compliance officer, Peter Davis, concerns a claim made by Shannon in relation to travel and subsistence. Davis said no further details of the alleged wrongdoing would be published until the investigation had been concluded.

Peter Robinson has stood down as first minister of Northern Ireland saying he is leaving the job confident that devolution has been secured for generations to come. In his his final speech from the Northern Ireland assembly's frontbench ahead of handing over to Arlene Foster, Robinson said:
When we take a step back and with the perspective of history we can see just how far we have come. We now live in a new era. You only have to look around to see the progress that there has been, not just in the physical structures that didn't exist a decade ago, but in the lives of our people. 
Though we don't always fully appreciate it, devolution underpins the level of peace and stability we enjoy today. After 35 years of stop-go government, devolution, with local people taking the decisions, is once again the norm. 
That has allowed us the platform to recast Northern Ireland's international image and to bring in more jobs than at any point in our history. Whereas once tourists avoided coming here we now attract people from all over the world.
I hereby resign the office of first minister with confidence that the political institutions we have together created will be here for generations to come.
Among those paying tribute to him was Martin McGuinness, the Sinn Fein deputy first minister. McGuinness said:
We faced many challenges and many difficulties but I think we came through in the end. I had a friendship with Ian Paisley until the day he died and I have no doubt I have a friendship with Peter which will exist until the day we both die.

 Cameron announces mentoring scheme for under-achieving teenagers  
In his speech David Cameron also announced a mentoring scheme to help teenagers at risk of under-achieving. Here is an extract from the Number 10 news release about this.
A new generation of high-flying mentors will be created to help struggling teens fulfil their potential and improve their life chances - Prime Minister David Cameron announced today.
Christine Hodgson, chair of Capgemini UK and The Careers & Enterprise Company, has agreed to lead a major campaign to encourage business people and professionals to volunteer to act as mentors to young teens at risk of dropping out of education or achieving less than they could.
While figures for young people not in education, training or employment (NEET) have fallen since 2010 - with numbers now at the lowest levels since records began - there are still tens of thousands of teenagers who are at risk of falling through the cracks.
Alongside this many bright children from disadvantaged backgrounds are not fulfilling their potential with figures showing pupils who score highly in primary school often struggle to continue that success into secondary school.
Around 25,000 pupils about to begin GCSEs risk under-achieving or dropping out: many of these would benefit from a mentor and the campaign will aim to ensure that they are not denied that support because no suitable mentors are available. 
The national mentoring campaign will see schools and businesses encouraged to work together to give these young people the best possible chance to succeed in later life.

 Full text of Catherine McKinnell's resignation letter  
Here is the full text of Catherine McKinnell's resignation letter (for anyone having difficulty reading the picture she posted on Twitter.)
Dear Jeremy,
I was genuinely surprised to be asked to join your shadow cabinet as shadow attorney general last September, however, I instantly acknowledged my duty to serve and the honour of doing so.
Whilst I did not support you for the leadership election, I recognised the significant mandate you had won from all sections of the party and was of course proud to be a member of a shadow cabinet that - for the first time ever - had a majority of women.
I also have huge respect for you personally as someone who has stood by their principles over many years and done so with decency and respect for those with whom you did not agree. I therefore thank you for giving me the opportunity to be part of your team. 
Since my election as the MP for Newcastle North in 2010, I have worked hard to represent my constituents both in Newcastle and in Westminster whilst juggling the demands of having young children and living in two different places.
I am the first to recognise that many parents and carers up and down the country are also balancing work with family life, However, there are three reasons why this situation has become more difficult for me since returning to parliament after the election in May.
As you know, I had my third child twelve months ago and have spend this past year combining care for him with both a general election campaign and then returning to parliament, including taking on the additional responsibility of a shadow cabinet post. The logistics of managing family life in Newcastle with my work down in Westminster have inevitably become more of a challenge.
The second is the reality of being a shadow cabinet member. Whilst this is of course a huge honour and privilege, it is perhaps not generally understood that this precludes an MP from speaking up in Parliament on issues outside their brief. Whilst I have been able to use my position to raise concerns about issues such as corporate criminal liability, serious economic crime, prosecution rates, legal aid, and access to justice, I have found it increasingly difficult not to be able to speak up in the Commons about other matters that are of huge importance to my constituents in Newcastle North. 
Both of these issues are amplified by a third factor - the situation in which the Labour party now finds itself. As somebody who came into politics with the sole motivation of making life better for my city, my region and, by extension, the country as a whole, I recognised that our electoral defeats in both 2010 and 2015 demanded a genuine and profound response from the Labour party. I therefore shared your optimism for the 'new kind of politics' you spoke so compellingly about.
However, as events have unfolded over recent weeks, my concerns about the direction and internal conflict within the Labour party have only grown, and I fear this is taking us down an increasingly negative path. I feel that I would like to channel my energy constructively, into making positive changes for my constituency.
Therefore, having given this much consideration over the weekend, I have reached the conclusion that I can better serve my constituents and the Labour party from the backbenches at this time, and with a heavy heart I resign from my post within your shadow cabinet.
Yours sincerely,
Catherine McKinnell

 McKinnell says she fears Labour is 'going down an increasingly negative path'  
In her resignation letter Catherine McKinnell said there were three reasons why she wanted to resign from the shadow cabinet.
She said that birth of her third child 12 months ago had made managing family life harder and that she found it frustrating not being able to speak out on constituency issues because of her shadow cabinet role.
But there was a third factor, she said - her concern about the direction in which the party was heading under Jeremy Corbyn.
As somebody who came into politics with the sole motivation of making life better for my city, my region and, by extension, the country as a whole, I recognised that our electoral defeats in both 2010 and 2015 demanded a genuine and profound response from the Labour party.

In the House of Lords today peers will debate the second reading of the trade union bill. As the Guardian's splash reports, Labour thinks the proposals in the bill to replace the current "opt out" system for people paying a levy into a union's political fund with an "opt in" system will cost the party £6m a year.
 Related:  Tories undermining Labour funding with 'partisan' trade union bill
The Lib Dems are also arguing that this is unfair. Normally peers do not vote on a bill at second reading, but Lord Tyler, the Lib Dem constitutional affairs spokesman, has tabled an amendment saying part of the bill should be considered by a select committee. This would delay consideration of the bill.
The Lib Dems say the committee on standards in public life proposed two key reforms to party funding laws in a report in 2011: a cap on individual donations, which was particularly hit the Tories; and an opt-in rule for union political funds, which would particularly hit Labour. The committee said its plans should be considered "as a package" because implementing one recommendation, but not the other, would be unfair. But this is exactly what the government is doing, the Lib Dems say. Tyler will highlight this point in the debate.
In a statement Tyler said:
Whatever your political background it is clear that this move is unfair, undemocratic and sets a dangerous precedent.
The Tories are manipulating the system unilaterally so they can hold on to power for years to come.
We are calling on the government to fulfil their past promises, to act in the public interest; they have to stop pulling strings behind the scenes to silence their opponents.
It is not clear, though, whether the Tyler amendment will actually be put to a vote. Votes at second reading in the Lords are very rare and Tyler may decide that it is more fruitful to push this point to a division at a later stage in the bill's passage through the Lords.

 Jeremy Corbyn's Today interview - Summary  
Jeremy Corbyn has had some praise for his Today programme interview. I will post a round-up shortly. But first here are the main news points..

Corbyn refused to rule out authorising drone strikes to kill jihadis. He sounded quite sceptical (no one will have come away from the interview feeling that he was itching to pull the trigger), but he did sound notably more open to the idea of authorising a strike like the one that killed the Britons in August than he has in previous interviews when he has questioned the whole legality of attacks like this. This is what he said when asked if he would authorise a drone strike to kill the jihadi in the recent Islamic State video showing five hostages being killed.
I think that's a hypothetical question. You have to look at the sources of the support of Isil, you have to look at the way it gets its money, the way it gets its weapons.
When pressed on this, he went on:
I would want to know what the evidence is, what difference it would make by doing that, what the chances were of capturing somebody - I suspect probably very, very low in those circumstances - so action could be taken. 

He said he had still not decided whether Labour's new policy on Trident will be decided by a ballot of all party members. Such a move would bypass the party's established policy making procedure, which involves the national policy forum drawing up policy and it being confirmed at party conference (where trade unions, many of which favour Trident, have 50% of the vote). Last week John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor and a key Corbyn ally, suggested party members would take the decision in a ballot. Corbyn said this was still unresolved. He said he wanted members to have "a big say" but that the details were not finalised.
I want members to have a big say in it. Whether that comes as a vote of individual members, or a vote at conference, that will be decided. I have not made up my mind on that.
But he suggested he was leaning towards a new procedure.
My whole election programme was based on the need for ordinary people to be able to participate much more in politics, so that leaders don't go away and write policy, so that executive groups don't go off and decide what the policy is, ordinary people do. 

He said Labour's new policy on Trident should have supporting the nuclear non-proliferation treaty at its heart.
It has to start from the basis that we are signed up to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, itself a creation of the 1960s Labour government of Harold Wilson, and that there also has to be a policy of what we do to ensure protection of skills and jobs throughout British industry that are in some part reliant on the whole Trident nuclear programme.
But if we want to live in a nuclear-free world, we have to recognise that we have to make a contribution to it. Renewing Trident, in my view, goes against the fundamental spirit of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty which requires the five declared nuclear weapons states not to renew their weapons systems. 

He said he supported the anti-Trident rally being planned for February and did not rule out speaking at it.

Corbyn said that he was "not in favour of terrorism of any sort" and that he did not believe the French government was responsible for the attacks on Paris.
I am absolutely not in favour of terrorism of any sort. It is absolutely appalling and disgraceful that civilian life should be taken by random acts of terrorism as happened in Paris...
Of course the French government were not responsible for the attacks on the streets of Paris any more than any other government was from the West.
But I would just say, listen very carefully to the analysis that President Obama gave of the situation in the Middle East when he said we have to think long and hard about the longer-term effects of both the war in Afghanistan and the war in Iraq, about what that does. We have a terrible situation in Syria, we have a terrible situation developing in Iraq and now sadly getting even worse in Afghanistan. Can we not think very long and hard about what our long-term policies and objectives have to be. 
Corbyn said he agreed with what Pat McFadden said about terrorists being responsible for their behaviour. But he also said he thought McFadden's comments on this in the Commons were distorting what Corbyn thought. He said McFadden was sacked as shadow Europe minister not just because of that, but because of various critical things he had said.

Corbyn said he opposed Saddam Hussein long before many of those who supported the Iraq war.
I was probably opposed to Saddam Hussein long before all those people who supported the war decided they were opposed to him.

He praised Hilary Benn, the shadow foreign secretary, for his "brilliant" performance attacking the government over its relationship with Saudi Arabia. He said he had had very long discussions with Benn during the reshuffle last week during which Benn kept his post, but he would not go into details.

He said British foreign policy should be based on human rights.
We has a country have got to develop a human rights-based foreign policy.

He claimed he did not know who briefed journalists that he intended to move Benn. "I'm not sure where the briefing came from," he said.

Corbyn claimed the reshuffle had made his frontbench team more representative of the country and of the parliamentary Labour party. He particularly highlighted two junior appointments as important: Emma Lewell-Buck taking responsibility for campaigning in the north; and Kate Osamor taking on equalities role

He said he supported junior doctors' strike.
We should recognise that junior doctors are qualified, extremely hard working, deserve to be treated properly, and Jeremy Hunt should now come to an agreement with them. 

He brushed aside the claim that he is not capable of winning over voters who do not already agree with him.
Somewhere along the line I've managed to be reelected eight times in my constituency, with very large majorities. I started off with a very small majority. I managed to receive the support of 250,000 members and supporters of the party during the leadership election. I realise that's not the public. 
But I just say this. If we carry on like this in this county, we end up with a more divided Britain, we end up with more people sleeping homeless, we end up with more young people in overcrowded accommodation, underachieving at school. We have a housing strategy that denies opportunity for everybody. Middle-class families whose children cannot leave because they cannot afford to buy anywhere, poorer families cannot get any council housing, forced into very expensive private rented accommodation. We can, will and must do things very differently. 

He paid tribute to David Bowie.
I think that it is great that we are spending time remembering a great musician, a great entertainer and someone that represents all that's best in the fantastic cultural diversity of this country. I can't think of David Bowie without thinking Life on Mars.

Q: Do you support the junior doctors' strike?
Corbyn says he has sent a message of support to them. There is no strike in Wales or Scotland, he says.
Q: Do you understand why people worry that Labour won't win if you are going to war with your party?
Corbyn says he does not want to go to war with anyone. He wants to offer a different approach to the economy. He has defeated the government on police cuts, on tax credits, and on the prison contract for Saudi Arabia.
Q: People wonder if you can win over people who are not Labour supporters. I have known you for years. You like protesting. You don't seem interested in talking to people who do not agree with you. People will say you cannot even persuade Labour colleagues to agree with you.
Corbyn says if we go on as we are going now, Britain will be more divided, inequality will get worse and more people will not be able to get housing. We need an alternative, he says.
And that's it. I will post a summary soon.

Q: A recent poll said fewer than one in five voters trust you to keep people safe. You sacked Pat McFadden for saying terrorists are responsible for their actions. Isn't that reasonable?
Corbyn says on the face of it what McFadden said was reasonable. But McFadden had said various critical things.
Q: Was it a distotortion of your views?
In some respects, yes, says Corbyn. Corbyn says he abhors terrorism.
Q: That's not the point. People think that you think France was partly to blame for what happened.
Corbyn says it is important to think about the consequences of foreign policy actions.
He says he wanted a peaceful solution to the Iraq crisis.
Q: If you were told a drone strike could kill the militant seen in the recent Islamic State video, would you approve it?
Corbyn says it is a hypothetical question. He would want to see the evidence.
Q: It is not really hypothetical. You disapprove of drone strikes.
Corbyn says he would want to see the evidence.

Q: Is it inconceivable that you could stand for election in 2020 on Labour's current policy?

 Jeremy Corbyn's Today interview  
Jeremy Corbyn starts with a tribute to David Bowie. He represented the cultural diversity of the UK, he says.
Q: How did the reshuffle make Labour stronger?
Corbyn says he has widened the shadow cabinet, to represent the diversity of the country and of the PLP.
Q: Why did you not move Hilary Benn?
Corbyn says there is huge work for Maria Eagle to do at culture. He says the party has a policy on Trident. But he has a position on Trident too.
Q: Journalists were briefed you wanted to move Benn?
Corbyn says he does not know where that briefing came from.
He had a long chat with Benn. He wants Benn to focus on attacking the government's human rights record.
Q: What will you do to ensure the party adopts your stance on Trident?
Corbyn says there will be a review of policy.
It will start by ensuring Labour backs the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, agreed by Harold Wilson's government.
Q: Will members of the Labour party get a vote on this?
Corbyn says he won't decide this; the national executive committee will decide.
But he wants a debate.
Q: You want members to have a vote?
Corbyn says he wants them to have "a big say". Whether that is through a vote, or through a vote at conference, he has not decided.

 Lunchtime summary  

<strong>Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, has been hit by a fresh resignation from his frontbench. The shadow attorney general, Catherine McKinnell, has resigned from Labour's frontbench, citing "concerns about the direction and internal conflict" within the party.

<strong>Corbyn has cleared the way for Labour party members to be given a decisive role in whether to change policy on the Trident nuclear weapons programme in a move that would downgrade the role of the party conference and the shadow cabinet.

<strong>Corbyn has refused to rule out authorising drone strikes to kill jihadis.<strong /> (See 9.45am.)

<strong>Cameron has announced an extension of his national citizen service programme. He did so in a well-trailed and substantial speech on life chances which also confirmed plans to rebuild 100 "sink estates", to promote parenting classes, and to improve perinatal mental health services, and included new plans for a mentoring programme for under-performing teenagers. (See 11.29am,12.32pm and 12.39pm.) I will post more from the speech when I have seen the full text.

<strong>Cameron has urged junior doctors to call off tomorrow's strike. He said:
 
This strike is not necessary, it will be damaging. We are doing everything we can to mitigate its effects but you cant have a strike on this scale in our NHS without their being some real difficulties for patients and potentially worse.  The Royal Air Force has used Brimstone missiles against Isis in Syria for the first time, Downing Street has confirmed.  Four Brimstone missiles were deployed on two missions on Sunday. As Frances Perraudin and Ewen MacAskill report, one missile was used against enemy positions near Raqqa, including targeting an Isis vehicle. Three Brimstone missiles were also used in an attack on the Omar oilfield on the same day. There were also three other RAF missions in Syria on Sunday that did not use Brimstone missiles, including striking enemy tunnels near Raqqa. Bombing Syria may please allies, but will have little effect on Isis Read moreThe prime minister's spokeswoman declined to say whether the strikes had resulted in casualties, saying: "These will all have been focused on either targeting Daesh [Isis]'s resources or targeting Daesh terrorists who are seeking to destabilise Iraq, Syria and threatening other countries."

The chief executive of HM Revenue and Customs, Lin Homer, is leaving the role after four years in which she faced fierce criticism over HMRC's failure to answer millions of calls from the public and its handling of the HSBC tax scandal.

Jim Shannon, a Democratic Unionist MP who for two years in a row has claimed the most expenses in the House of Commons is being investigated by a parliamentary watchdog. As Henry McDonald reports, the MP for Strangford in Northern Ireland, was paid a total of £205,798 in taxpayer-funded expenses last year, excluding travel.The rare formal investigation by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority's compliance officer, Peter Davis, concerns a claim made by Shannon in relation to travel and subsistence. Davis said no further details of the alleged wrongdoing would be published until the investigation had been concluded.

Peter Robinson has stood down as first minister of Northern Ireland saying he is leaving the job confident that devolution has been secured for generations to come. In his his final speech from the Northern Ireland assembly's frontbench ahead of handing over to Arlene Foster, Robinson said:
When we take a step back and with the perspective of history we can see just how far we have come. We now live in a new era. You only have to look around to see the progress that there has been, not just in the physical structures that didn't exist a decade ago, but in the lives of our people. 
Though we don't always fully appreciate it, devolution underpins the level of peace and stability we enjoy today. After 35 years of stop-go government, devolution, with local people taking the decisions, is once again the norm. 
That has allowed us the platform to recast Northern Ireland's international image and to bring in more jobs than at any point in our history. Whereas once tourists avoided coming here we now attract people from all over the world.
I hereby resign the office of first minister with confidence that the political institutions we have together created will be here for generations to come.
Among those paying tribute to him was Martin McGuinness, the Sinn Fein deputy first minister. McGuinness said:
We faced many challenges and many difficulties but I think we came through in the end. I had a friendship with Ian Paisley until the day he died and I have no doubt I have a friendship with Peter which will exist until the day we both die.

 Cameron announces mentoring scheme for under-achieving teenagers  
In his speech David Cameron also announced a mentoring scheme to help teenagers at risk of under-achieving. Here is an extract from the Number 10 news release about this.
A new generation of high-flying mentors will be created to help struggling teens fulfil their potential and improve their life chances - Prime Minister David Cameron announced today.
Christine Hodgson, chair of Capgemini UK and The Careers & Enterprise Company, has agreed to lead a major campaign to encourage business people and professionals to volunteer to act as mentors to young teens at risk of dropping out of education or achieving less than they could.
While figures for young people not in education, training or employment (NEET) have fallen since 2010 - with numbers now at the lowest levels since records began - there are still tens of thousands of teenagers who are at risk of falling through the cracks.
Alongside this many bright children from disadvantaged backgrounds are not fulfilling their potential with figures showing pupils who score highly in primary school often struggle to continue that success into secondary school.
Around 25,000 pupils about to begin GCSEs risk under-achieving or dropping out: many of these would benefit from a mentor and the campaign will aim to ensure that they are not denied that support because no suitable mentors are available. 
The national mentoring campaign will see schools and businesses encouraged to work together to give these young people the best possible chance to succeed in later life.

 Full text of Catherine McKinnell's resignation letter  
Here is the full text of Catherine McKinnell's resignation letter (for anyone having difficulty reading the picture she posted on Twitter.)
Dear Jeremy,
I was genuinely surprised to be asked to join your shadow cabinet as shadow attorney general last September, however, I instantly acknowledged my duty to serve and the honour of doing so.
Whilst I did not support you for the leadership election, I recognised the significant mandate you had won from all sections of the party and was of course proud to be a member of a shadow cabinet that - for the first time ever - had a majority of women.
I also have huge respect for you personally as someone who has stood by their principles over many years and done so with decency and respect for those with whom you did not agree. I therefore thank you for giving me the opportunity to be part of your team. 
Since my election as the MP for Newcastle North in 2010, I have worked hard to represent my constituents both in Newcastle and in Westminster whilst juggling the demands of having young children and living in two different places.
I am the first to recognise that many parents and carers up and down the country are also balancing work with family life, However, there are three reasons why this situation has become more difficult for me since returning to parliament after the election in May.
As you know, I had my third child twelve months ago and have spend this past year combining care for him with both a general election campaign and then returning to parliament, including taking on the additional responsibility of a shadow cabinet post. The logistics of managing family life in Newcastle with my work down in Westminster have inevitably become more of a challenge.
The second is the reality of being a shadow cabinet member. Whilst this is of course a huge honour and privilege, it is perhaps not generally understood that this precludes an MP from speaking up in Parliament on issues outside their brief. Whilst I have been able to use my position to raise concerns about issues such as corporate criminal liability, serious economic crime, prosecution rates, legal aid, and access to justice, I have found it increasingly difficult not to be able to speak up in the Commons about other matters that are of huge importance to my constituents in Newcastle North. 
Both of these issues are amplified by a third factor - the situation in which the Labour party now finds itself. As somebody who came into politics with the sole motivation of making life better for my city, my region and, by extension, the country as a whole, I recognised that our electoral defeats in both 2010 and 2015 demanded a genuine and profound response from the Labour party. I therefore shared your optimism for the 'new kind of politics' you spoke so compellingly about.
However, as events have unfolded over recent weeks, my concerns about the direction and internal conflict within the Labour party have only grown, and I fear this is taking us down an increasingly negative path. I feel that I would like to channel my energy constructively, into making positive changes for my constituency.
Therefore, having given this much consideration over the weekend, I have reached the conclusion that I can better serve my constituents and the Labour party from the backbenches at this time, and with a heavy heart I resign from my post within your shadow cabinet.
Yours sincerely,
Catherine McKinnell
block-time published-time 11.46am GMT 
 McKinnell says she fears Labour is 'going down an increasingly negative path'  
In her resignation letter Catherine McKinnell said there were three reasons why she wanted to resign from the shadow cabinet.
She said that birth of her third child 12 months ago had made managing family life harder and that she found it frustrating not being able to speak out on constituency issues because of her shadow cabinet role.
But there was a third factor, she said - her concern about the direction in which the party was heading under Jeremy Corbyn.
As somebody who came into politics with the sole motivation of making life better for my city, my region and, by extension, the country as a whole, I recognised that our electoral defeats in both 2010 and 2015 demanded a genuine and profound response from the Labour party.

In the House of Lords today peers will debate the second reading of the trade union bill. As the Guardian's splash reports, Labour thinks the proposals in the bill to replace the current "opt out" system for people paying a levy into a union's political fund with an "opt in" system will cost the party £6m a year.
 Related:  Tories undermining Labour funding with 'partisan' trade union bill
The Lib Dems are also arguing that this is unfair. Normally peers do not vote on a bill at second reading, but Lord Tyler, the Lib Dem constitutional affairs spokesman, has tabled an amendment saying part of the bill should be considered by a select committee. This would delay consideration of the bill.
The Lib Dems say the committee on standards in public life proposed two key reforms to party funding laws in a report in 2011: a cap on individual donations, which was particularly hit the Tories; and an opt-in rule for union political funds, which would particularly hit Labour. The committee said its plans should be considered "as a package" because implementing one recommendation, but not the other, would be unfair. But this is exactly what the government is doing, the Lib Dems say. Tyler will highlight this point in the debate.
In a statement Tyler said:
Whatever your political background it is clear that this move is unfair, undemocratic and sets a dangerous precedent.
The Tories are manipulating the system unilaterally so they can hold on to power for years to come.
We are calling on the government to fulfil their past promises, to act in the public interest; they have to stop pulling strings behind the scenes to silence their opponents.
It is not clear, though, whether the Tyler amendment will actually be put to a vote. Votes at second reading in the Lords are very rare and Tyler may decide that it is more fruitful to push this point to a division at a later stage in the bill's passage through the Lords.

 Jeremy Corbyn's Today interview - Summary  
Jeremy Corbyn has had some praise for his Today programme interview. I will post a round-up shortly. But first here are the main news points..

Corbyn refused to rule out authorising drone strikes to kill jihadis. He sounded quite sceptical (no one will have come away from the interview feeling that he was itching to pull the trigger), but he did sound notably more open to the idea of authorising a strike like the one that killed the Britons in August than he has in previous interviews when he has questioned the whole legality of attacks like this. This is what he said when asked if he would authorise a drone strike to kill the jihadi in the recent Islamic State video showing five hostages being killed.
I think that's a hypothetical question. You have to look at the sources of the support of Isil, you have to look at the way it gets its money, the way it gets its weapons.
When pressed on this, he went on:
I would want to know what the evidence is, what difference it would make by doing that, what the chances were of capturing somebody - I suspect probably very, very low in those circumstances - so action could be taken. 

He said he had still not decided whether Labour's new policy on Trident will be decided by a ballot of all party members. Such a move would bypass the party's established policy making procedure, which involves the national policy forum drawing up policy and it being confirmed at party conference (where trade unions, many of which favour Trident, have 50% of the vote). Last week John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor and a key Corbyn ally, suggested party members would take the decision in a ballot. Corbyn said this was still unresolved. He said he wanted members to have "a big say" but that the details were not finalised.
I want members to have a big say in it. Whether that comes as a vote of individual members, or a vote at conference, that will be decided. I have not made up my mind on that.
But he suggested he was leaning towards a new procedure.
My whole election programme was based on the need for ordinary people to be able to participate much more in politics, so that leaders don't go away and write policy, so that executive groups don't go off and decide what the policy is, ordinary people do. 

He said Labour's new policy on Trident should have supporting the nuclear non-proliferation treaty at its heart.
It has to start from the basis that we are signed up to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, itself a creation of the 1960s Labour government of Harold Wilson, and that there also has to be a policy of what we do to ensure protection of skills and jobs throughout British industry that are in some part reliant on the whole Trident nuclear programme.
But if we want to live in a nuclear-free world, we have to recognise that we have to make a contribution to it. Renewing Trident, in my view, goes against the fundamental spirit of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty which requires the five declared nuclear weapons states not to renew their weapons systems. 

He said he supported the anti-Trident rally being planned for February and did not rule out speaking at it.

Corbyn said that he was "not in favour of terrorism of any sort" and that he did not believe the French government was responsible for the attacks on Paris.
I am absolutely not in favour of terrorism of any sort. It is absolutely appalling and disgraceful that civilian life should be taken by random acts of terrorism as happened in Paris...
Of course the French government were not responsible for the attacks on the streets of Paris any more than any other government was from the West.
But I would just say, listen very carefully to the analysis that President Obama gave of the situation in the Middle East when he said we have to think long and hard about the longer-term effects of both the war in Afghanistan and the war in Iraq, about what that does. We have a terrible situation in Syria, we have a terrible situation developing in Iraq and now sadly getting even worse in Afghanistan. Can we not think very long and hard about what our long-term policies and objectives have to be. 
Corbyn said he agreed with what Pat McFadden said about terrorists being responsible for their behaviour. But he also said he thought McFadden's comments on this in the Commons were distorting what Corbyn thought. He said McFadden was sacked as shadow Europe minister not just because of that, but because of various critical things he had said.

Corbyn said he opposed Saddam Hussein long before many of those who supported the Iraq war.
I was probably opposed to Saddam Hussein long before all those people who supported the war decided they were opposed to him.

He praised Hilary Benn, the shadow foreign secretary, for his "brilliant" performance attacking the government over its relationship with Saudi Arabia. He said he had had very long discussions with Benn during the reshuffle last week during which Benn kept his post, but he would not go into details.

He said British foreign policy should be based on human rights.
We has a country have got to develop a human rights-based foreign policy.

He claimed he did not know who briefed journalists that he intended to move Benn. "I'm not sure where the briefing came from," he said.

Corbyn claimed the reshuffle had made his frontbench team more representative of the country and of the parliamentary Labour party. He particularly highlighted two junior appointments as important: Emma Lewell-Buck taking responsibility for campaigning in the north; and Kate Osamor taking on equalities role

He said he supported junior doctors' strike.
We should recognise that junior doctors are qualified, extremely hard working, deserve to be treated properly, and Jeremy Hunt should now come to an agreement with them. 

He brushed aside the claim that he is not capable of winning over voters who do not already agree with him.
Somewhere along the line I've managed to be reelected eight times in my constituency, with very large majorities. I started off with a very small majority. I managed to receive the support of 250,000 members and supporters of the party during the leadership election. I realise that's not the public. 
But I just say this. If we carry on like this in this county, we end up with a more divided Britain, we end up with more people sleeping homeless, we end up with more young people in overcrowded accommodation, underachieving at school. We have a housing strategy that denies opportunity for everybody. Middle-class families whose children cannot leave because they cannot afford to buy anywhere, poorer families cannot get any council housing, forced into very expensive private rented accommodation. We can, will and must do things very differently. 

He paid tribute to David Bowie.
I think that it is great that we are spending time remembering a great musician, a great entertainer and someone that represents all that's best in the fantastic cultural diversity of this country. I can't think of David Bowie without thinking Life on Mars.

Q: Do you support the junior doctors' strike?
Corbyn says he has sent a message of support to them. There is no strike in Wales or Scotland, he says.
Q: Do you understand why people worry that Labour won't win if you are going to war with your party?
Corbyn says he does not want to go to war with anyone. He wants to offer a different approach to the economy. He has defeated the government on police cuts, on tax credits, and on the prison contract for Saudi Arabia.
Q: People wonder if you can win over people who are not Labour supporters. I have known you for years. You like protesting. You don't seem interested in talking to people who do not agree with you. People will say you cannot even persuade Labour colleagues to agree with you.
Corbyn says if we go on as we are going now, Britain will be more divided, inequality will get worse and more people will not be able to get housing. We need an alternative, he says.
And that's it. I will post a summary soon.

Q: A recent poll said fewer than one in five voters trust you to keep people safe. You sacked Pat McFadden for saying terrorists are responsible for their actions. Isn't that reasonable?
Corbyn says on the face of it what McFadden said was reasonable. But McFadden had said various critical things.
Q: Was it a distotortion of your views?
In some respects, yes, says Corbyn. Corbyn says he abhors terrorism.
Q: That's not the point. People think that you think France was partly to blame for what happened.
Corbyn says it is important to think about the consequences of foreign policy actions.
He says he wanted a peaceful solution to the Iraq crisis.
Q: If you were told a drone strike could kill the militant seen in the recent Islamic State video, would you approve it?
Corbyn says it is a hypothetical question. He would want to see the evidence.
Q: It is not really hypothetical. You disapprove of drone strikes.
Corbyn says he would want to see the evidence.

Q: Is it inconceivable that you could stand for election in 2020 on Labour's current policy?
Corbyn says Nick Robinson is suggesting a crisis that does not exist. The Labour party will look at this policy.
Q: There is a big anti-Trident rally in February. Will you speak at it?
Corbyn says he has not been invited yet. But he is supportive of the rally.

 Jeremy Corbyn's Today interview  
Jeremy Corbyn starts with a tribute to David Bowie. He represented the cultural diversity of the UK, he says.
Q: How did the reshuffle make Labour stronger?
Corbyn says he has widened the shadow cabinet, to represent the diversity of the country and of the PLP.
Q: Why did you not move Hilary Benn?
Corbyn says there is huge work for Maria Eagle to do at culture. He says the party has a policy on Trident. But he has a position on Trident too.
Q: Journalists were briefed you wanted to move Benn?
Corbyn says he does not know where that briefing came from.
He had a long chat with Benn. He wants Benn to focus on attacking the government's human rights record.
Q: What will you do to ensure the party adopts your stance on Trident?
Corbyn says there will be a review of policy.
It will start by ensuring Labour backs the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, agreed by Harold Wilson's government.
Q: Will members of the Labour party get a vote on this?
Corbyn says he won't decide this; the national executive committee will decide.
But he wants a debate.
Q: You want members to have a vote?
Corbyn says he wants them to have "a big say". Whether that is through a vote, or through a vote at conference, he has not decided.

The fall of Jersey: how a tax haven goes bust; 
Jersey bet its future on finance but since 2007 it has fallen on hard times and is heading for bankruptcy. Is the island's perilous present Britain's bleak future?.

Oliver Bullough.

As you approach Jersey by air, your plane's shadow touches cliffs rising from the English Channel, then patchwork fields with wooded dingles between them, then four-square buildings with groomed lawns. Down below, the island is lush and verdant, set in a sparkling procession of eastward-marching waves. It looks like a bit of Devon that ran away to sea and did rather well for itself.
John Christensen grew up in one of those handsome houses, a Norman manor surrounded by fields. "It was heaven," he said. "There were fantastic beaches, a strong sense of fun, because of the tourism industry. The Beatles played at Springfield in 1963, stuff like that. It was cool."
Christensen, who was born in 1956, is almost exactly the same age as Jersey's offshore finance industry. While he was playing with his brothers in the grand rooms of the family home, Jersey lawyers were spotting one of the most profitable loopholes in history. 
At that time, the world severely restricted the movement of money. Politicians blamed financial speculators for the Great Depression of the 1930s, and had imposed capital controls to prevent something similar happening again. Pounds were trapped in Britain, where taxes were high. If a person died wealthy, their heirs had to give 80% of any inheritance over £1m to the government.

There was Jersey's business opportunity: the island had no inheritance tax. If wealthy Brits invested their millions in Jersey, some now-forgotten genius realised, the UK exchequer could not touch them. The money poured in, because the schemes did not end with inheritance: almost any tax could be avoided there, if you planned it right. Where wealthy individuals started, banks soon followed, utterly transforming the island. Bankers and tax exiles moved into St Peter, the parish where Christensen grew up, driving up prices and importing the values and conversation of the City of London to this improbable place.
"Who wants to pay taxes on profits in London when you could do it in Jersey?" Christensen recalled. "It was changing enormously, particularly by the early 1970s when the really big players began to establish themselves."
Today, the offices of those big players form a wall of glass along the seafront of Jersey's capital, St Helier: Credit Suisse, Citi, HSBC, SociÈtÈ GÈnÈrale, PWC. And they oversee a vast amount of money. By 2007, Jersey - home to just 100,000 people - held almost £220bn of deposits, and administered another £221bn of funds, as well as hundreds of billions in trusts. The finance sector's profits that year were more than £1bn, unemployment was barely 1%, and gross national income per person was significantly higher than in Britain or the US.
From the waterfront, the money spreads inland. St Helier is a prosperous resort with cafes, theatres and covered markets. It is cleaner, busier, neater, brighter than almost any seaside town you will find on the British mainland. Appearances are deceptive, however. Jersey looks rich - but it is heading towards bankruptcy.
In April, officials announced that the budget would be short £125m a year by 2019. "What went wrong?" asked the Jersey Evening Post. And that was just the start of it. By June, the annual deficit - now known on the island as the "black hole" - had been revised upwards to £145m, more than £1 in every five that the government spends. "The black hole is so big," according to Connect, a Jersey business magazine, that "filling it will take the equivalent of shutting down every school in the island, laying off every teacher, letting the parks turn into overgrown jungles and having our roads literally fall apart."
That is quite a hole, and the question is, how can Jersey fill it? The solutions are not pretty: voluntary redundancies, compulsory redundancies, new taxes, fewer public services.
Jersey bet its future on finance, allowing its other industries to shrivel, in the belief that it could live well in perpetuity from moving other people's money around. If that belief was false, then does its fate await another island off the coast of France - one that has also pledged its future to finance? In short, is Jersey's worrying present Britain's bleak future?

* * *
                     Jersey is 19 miles from France,  85 miles from England. It is not a country, nor is it part of another country. It is half-British, half-something-else - 45 square miles of self-governing ambiguity entirely surrounded by water. It gained this peculiar status in 1204, when King John lost the Duchy of Normandy to France. Or rather, he lost most of it. He managed to keep the duchy's offshore possessions - Jersey, Guernsey, Alderney, Sark, Herm, plus assorted rocks, reefs and islets, collectively known as the Channel Islands.
The French took a while to accept the situation: London and Paris tussled over the islands for almost 300 years. Eventually, however,  Pope Sixtus IV intervened and, in 1481, issued a papal bull of neutrality. England and France could wage war, but the Channel Islands, by religious injunction, could not. The result was that Jersey traded unimpeded with both sides, and thus its enchanted inbetween life began.
This ambiguous status - Jersey was British enough to have the pound but not British enough to pay taxes - lay at the heart of the island's offshore industry. By the end of the 1960s, Jersey's banks had deposits of almost £300m, 10 times the per capita ratio of the UK. In 1970 alone, deposits increased by 45%, and then kept on rising.
The gentleman farmers that ran the island had no experience running an offshore financial centre. So, in 1969, they poached an English economist named Colin Powell from the government of Northern Ireland, to help them understand what was going on. He has guided finance's colonisation of Jersey ever since, in one role or another. (Some people call him "Jersey's Jeeves", which is not exactly flattering to the gentlemen farmers.)
Powell's approach to British taxes was curiously anarchic for a government economist, akin to the contempt of early pirate radio DJs for the overmighty BBC. "If the attractions of Jersey as a low-tax area stem from the high levels of UK taxation, the island should not be criticised for offering an escape," Powell argued, in a study of Jersey's economy published in 1971. In other words: if laws are dumb, there is nothing wrong with working around them.
Jersey did very well out of the strategy that Powell mapped out for it, and the 1970s continued where the 1960s left off. Many of the big North American, European and British banks opened branches in St Helier. They brought the money in and sent it out again, often on the same day. But that allowed them to, in essence, stamp "Made in Jersey" on it, rather than "Made in Britain", which lowered the tax burden. Jersey's officials began to describe the island as a "specialist offshoot of the City": London without the rules, or the taxes.
Powell turned 80 this year, and his current official role is to advise Jersey's government on "international affairs". He is long-nosed and lean, and has a disconcertingly precise power of recall over almost any detail of his five decades on the island. He came to Jersey at a time when the British empire's decline was almost complete. As the old colonies gained independence, Brits returned home, and there were fewer and fewer places to stash their hard-earned pounds out of the reach of Her Majesty's tax collectors. In 1974, the UK's top marginal rate of tax on investments income hit 98%. Faced with the prospect of keeping just tuppence of every pound in dividends they earned, rich Britons put as much into Jersey as they could.
"They know that Jersey has political stability, doesn't have political parties. It's not going to be faced with a sudden swing to the left, or swing to the right, or whatever direction, a change of tax arrangements. It's also got fiscal stability," Powell explained, during a long evening interview in his surprisingly modest office in St Helier.
Foreign businesses that registered in Jersey paid no tax at all, while the local banks, lawyers, accountants, and administrators that helped them paid 20% on their incomes - a fraction of that paid by their counterparts in the UK. The rate was low but, with this much business going on, the government's coffers swelled. In the three decades after Powell took over, Jersey's annual budget increased, in real terms, fivefold.
Jersey built new schools, new hospitals, new roads, a new harbour, a new marina. Unemployment was barely 2%. The government had so much money that it squirrelled away a year's worth of expenditure just in case. And all the time, income tax was only 20p in the pound. There was no inheritance tax; no VAT; no capital gains tax; no tax on corporate profits if your business was outside Jersey. Compare that with strife-torn Britain where, until the very end of Margaret Thatcher's time in office, the top marginal rate of income tax was 60%, and one in eight adults was out of work.
A gushing article published in 1984 by Chatham House's World Today magazine noted that Jersey residents had almost twice as many phones per household as Brits, and more than twice as many cars. The island was a miracle of plenty, which somehow combined a comprehensive welfare state with tax rates to satisfy enthusiastic libertarians. Its reputation was of a well-regulated haven in the midst of the political turmoil then afflicting the UK, and the money kept pouring in.
By the end of the 1980s, Jersey had evolved from simply serving UK depositors keen to avoid tax. It was now happy to help anyone, from anywhere, to avoid anything. When officials in Moscow wanted to hide the Communist party's funds in the last days of the Soviet Union, they put them in Jersey. When post-Soviet oligarchs wanted to obscure their ownership of assets, they structured them through Jersey. When South Africans wanted to avoid apartheid-related sanctions, they did so through Jersey.
By the end of the 1980s, Jersey was happy to help anyone, from anywhere, to avoid anything
Powell had so much work to do keeping track of the economy he had unleashed that, in 1987, he hired an assistant, John Christensen, the local boy from the Norman manor house. Middle-aged men from Jersey are often of a particular type. They are slim and straight-backed, tanned and neat, with an accent that is somewhere between BBC and colonial. Christensen, who is now 59, is the type's epitome.
Christensen had volunteered for Oxfam while studying in Britain, and was never a particularly enthusiastic recruit to his native island's new industry. He remembers complaining about how Jersey was keeping money for corrupt African officials, and being told "nobody gives a shit about Africa anyway". Over the years, he became increasingly troubled by the amount of dirty money coming in, and the fact no one on the island appeared to care.
For Christensen, the final indignity came in 1993 when a foreign exchange trader defrauded investors (mostly Americans) out of $26m via a Jersey subsidiary - a scam that local authorities refused to investigate for years.
When the scandal attracted the attention of a reporter from the Wall Street Journal a few years later, there was little doubt about the identity of Jersey's "senior civil servant" who said, of his colleagues: "They are totally out of their depth". It was effectively Christensen's resignation letter. He felt that the island was helping foreign villains hide stolen wealth, and wanted no part of it. Besides, the business seemed to be doing as much harm as good to Jersey itself.
"Price inflation had made house prices and labour market costs so high that virtually no other industry apart from finance - international finance - could survive," Christensen explained. "The housing market was at London levels, no locals could afford to buy, unless they were employed either in the public sector or the finance sector."
Jersey had not heard the last of him, however. Now there may be times when Powell wishes he had never hired Christensen at all.

* * *
                     In 1998, the day after quitting his job, John Christensen quit Jersey too, taking with him a decade's worth of pent-up frustration and a whole lot of insider knowledge. He resolved to reveal what he knew about how offshore finance really works, which has made him an irritant to Jersey's authorities and a hero to its critics: the closest thing the island has to a Trotsky.
Perhaps his most notable comrade in this struggle is the accountant and Quaker Richard Murphy, whom he met by chance in 2002. "Richard and John have done magical things, absolute miracles," said Pat Lucas, a teacher on Jersey and another veteran campaigner against the offshore industry. "They have changed the whole narrative."
Christensen and Murphy were among the founders of the  Tax Justice Network  (TJN), which investigates the offshore industry, and publishes a Financial Secrecy Index, to assess how tax havens attract illicit cash.
The biennial index, launched in 2009, has consistently ranked Jersey in or close to the top 10 jurisdictions facilitating "illicit financial flows and capital flight" - ahead of the British Virgin Islands, Panama and Gibraltar. Newspapers from around the world picked up on the studies, and highlighted Jersey's role in sucking wealth out of the countries that need it most.
Every new version of the index was a grenade of bad publicity lobbed at Jersey, increasingly damaging to the island's reputation. Jersey Finance, the government-funded body for promoting the island's financial industry, dismissed the 2013 index as "contrived propaganda", but officials struggled to gain much of a hearing, something many of them appear to find extremely frustrating.
Christensen and Murphy are not solely responsible for Jersey's troubles but sometimes, when talking to officials, you could be forgiven for thinking they were. (At one point during my interview with the former treasury and resources minister Philip Ozouf, he appeared temporarily to forget he was talking to me. "What's wrong about that, Mr Murphy? That's good stuff," he said, as if fantasising about taking on the turbulent accountant.)
As for Christensen, it is an article of faith on Jersey that he only criticises the island because, in 1998, he did not get a promotion. ("It's baggage, yeah," said John Harris, of the Jersey Financial Services Commission, the island's regulator. "He has baggage, serious baggage.") This is something Christensen denies, though he is not the kind of man to get into a slanging match.
Murphy, on the other hand, is combative - he advised Jeremy Corbyn during his leadership campaign for the Labour party - and has no such reservations. "They have for 10 years refused to accept that, fundamentally, their business model is, to use a technical term, fucked," he told me.
If Christensen, Murphy and their gang had been Jersey's only opponents, the island's feelings would be hurt, but it would otherwise probably remain unharmed. In Brussels, however, the island has enemies with more powerful weapons than bad publicity. Officials in European countries were furious about Jersey helping their citizens avoid taxes. In 1997, they began to take action.
In a new code of conduct, the EU insisted that all members (as well as those jurisdictions that wanted equal access to its market, such as Jersey) tax local and non-local companies the same. The rules were not to be imposed for another decade, but it was immediately clear that they threatened to destroy Jersey's business model, which was reliant on giving foreign companies tax advantages denied to locals.
Technically, officials had a choice: they could either raise taxes for foreigners, or cut them for locals, providing everyone ended up being treated the same way. In reality, however, Jersey had no choice at all - not if it wanted to keep its finance industry. Dozens of other small jurisdictions had followed its lead into financial services and, if it raised taxes for everyone to 20%, all the lucrative trade would evaporate from its computer screens, only to condense in places with lower levies: the Isle of Man, Dublin, Singapore or Hong Kong.
So, in 2008, it abolished taxes for all companies except financial firms (which pay 10%) and utilities (which were left with the 20% rate). The two main tax bands gave the policy its name: Zero-10. And thus, the black hole opened. Between 2009 and 2010, tax receipts from companies fell by almost two-thirds: from £218m to £83m.
As public awareness of the black hole has grown, so has criticism of the government. "This was, once upon time, an inclusive island where we all felt as one, whether you were a politician or a road sweeper or a nurse, whoever. We all shared in the prosperity," said Nick Corbel, head of Jersey's branch of Unite, when we met in May. "As a Jerseyman, as someone who was born on the island, and I can trace my heritage back, I love this island, love its people, I love how we used to do things here. But it's depressing, personally depressing, seeing where this island's heading, the total lack of compassion and understanding from our leaders There is nothing there at all, they're absolutely cold."
Ozouf, the architect of Zero-10, lost his ministerial position after last autumn's elections, and now works as a sort of roving ambassador. It was in that capacity that we met in Jersey's Westminster office in September. He is passionate, fluent, charming and prone to speaking in extremely long sentences, without taking a breath. He immediately launched a long denial of the existence of a black hole at all.
"Let's be clear about what a black hole is. A black hole is an amount of money, which needs to be found in order for the government to put in place its plan to make substantial investments in education and healthcare and improve our society."
There is something in what he says - nearly half of the deficit is indeed caused by extra spending on healthcare and education - but that is not really the point. The criticism stems from how the government has tried to fill the black hole that it opened. In 2008, it introduced a sales tax, which now adds 5% to the price of almost everything. That has not raised enough money, so now it is looking at other charges: including for medical services, sewage disposal, and more. It is looking to cut benefits for pensioners, single parents and young people, and to lay off public sector workers.
Officials argue that there is significant room for cuts, and perhaps there is. In Jersey, the average state employee earns £900 a week, almost twice the equivalent salary in the UK. However you look at it, though, ordinary people, through higher prices and pay freezes, job losses and benefit cuts, are plugging a hole left by a massive corporate tax break. By 2012, the sales tax was raising more revenue than the tax on companies.
But Ozouf continues to insist that Jersey had no choice. He needed to cut taxes to keep finance on the island, not least because there are no other industries left to plug the gap.

* * *
                     There is a claim often made in Jersey that the local economy is a stool with three legs: finance, tourism and agriculture. Before finance, tourism was the sturdiest of the three and the basis of the island's prosperity. Jersey's message to postwar British holidaymakers was simple but effective: we're like France, but without the French people. In 1979, almost 1.5 million people came to Jersey on holiday, the place where you could speak English and eat chips. In 2014, there were just 338,000. The Jersey tourism industry has, essentially, collapsed.
The number of beds in the island's hotels has almost halved since the late 1990s, and many of the businesses that are left look tired. One hotel on the waterfront in St Helier advertises Fawlty Towers-themed dining nights. It looks out onto a salt-water pool that fills up at high tide, so swimmers do not have to walk out across the beach for a dip. There is a market for that, obviously, but it is not a growing one.
Ted Vibert, 77, ran Jersey's tourism promotion campaign in the early 1960s, and despairs of what has happened to the island. When we spoke this summer, he had just been to Cyprus for a week at a beachfront hotel, where he could eat and drink as much as he liked, for £400 all in. Low-cost airlines, improved communications, and easier travel have all made foreign holidays cheaper, and Jersey has not tried to compete. Vibert blames finance. It pushed up prices, attracted the best talent, and drew the government's attention away from tourism. Who needs the hassle of serving tea to middle-aged Brits when you already have more cash than you know what to do with?
Before tourism, the third leg of the stool - agriculture - did most work supporting the island. Jersey is sunny and fertile. Its high-quality woollen goods gave a name - "jersey" - to any kind of long-sleeved top. Jersey cattle, with their deliciously rich milk, and Jersey royal potatoes are famous well beyond the island.
But when I walked for six hours across the island in September, from the airport eastwards, then up to the north coast, I saw just one dairy herd - a clump of honey-gold cows blinking stupidly over a gate - and not much sign of anything but fallow fields, waiting for the potatoes to be planted again in spring. In the 1980s, Jersey glittered with greenhouses growing tomatoes, broccoli, cauliflowers and flowers for the UK market. It does not any more.
"It's been a gradual decline from the 1970s, when finance took off," said Graham Le Lay, president of the Jersey Farmers' Union. "Generally the island is much more prosperous because of it. It's just unfortunate that it's been the farmers who've been the meat in the sandwich."
Jersey's financial sector is now seven times larger than the agricultural and hospitality sectors put together. Since the 1970s, the island's economy has lost two legs, and now Jersey is worryingly dependent on that last leg staying strong.
Jersey has no thinktanks or pollsters. The only daily newspaper, the Jersey Evening Post, was until recently owned by the chief minister, and even now tends to follow the government's line. As a result, it is extremely hard to get a sense of what ordinary Jerseymen and women think about the transformation of their home from a bucket-and-spade tourist resort to the frontline of financialisation.
It was while looking for pointers that I came across Marigold Dark, a racy dystopian thriller about an alcoholic Jersey private eye confronted with corrupt coppers, amoral financiers and a wealthy foreign oligarch keen to buy up the island. The fictional locals in the book, which was published in March, are resigned to their fate. "We all know that foreign money has the run of this place," one says. "But it's quite another thing altogether to openly replace the Jersey flag with a set of splayed arse cheeks and a dollar sign."
The author, Paul Bisson, is an English teacher in St Helier. The book, he told me, is a satire, but it reflects a genuine unease about what has happened to the island. "The finance industry has been good to Jersey in the years gone by. But what irks me is the fact we seem to have put too many eggs in one basket, it's almost like we've surrendered part of our soul to finance," he said, over tea in a cafe in the middle of St Helier. He did not really know if other people shared his concerns. Most people don't much like to talk about it, he told me.
Most people prefer not to get engaged in politics at all. The States Assembly influences every aspect of life on Jersey, and crafts the regulations for the island's financial sector, but it does so with almost no popular involvement. Turnout in St Helier was less than 30% in last year's general election.
The speaker of the assembly - the bailiff, who is also the chief judge - is unelected, while its members are chosen from a talent pool slightly smaller than that of Crawley borough council. That's a worrying prospect for anyone keen on rigorous oversight, and it has translated into important aspects of financial regulation going through on the nod.
It is hardly surprising that Jersey's politicians should want to protect its finance sector, however, even at the cost of the rest of the economy disappearing. The miracle of offshore has conjured wealth for everyone lucky enough to live on Jersey. In betting terms, Jersey picked the fastest and strongest horse in the field, and staked its future on it. Then the horse had a heart attack.

                     It is only when the tide goes out,  Warren Buffett has said of financial skulduggery, that you discover who has been swimming naked. When the credit crunch sucked the liquidity out of the world's markets, Jersey was revealed to be not so much skinny-dipping, as dumping toxic waste on the beach.
The first inklings of Jersey's role in the greatest financial crisis in history came in August 2007, when HBOS - the bank created out of Halifax and the Bank of Scotland - announced it was going to loan money to a Jersey-registered debt vehicle named Grampian Funding, which had assets of £18bn.
"News that Grampian existed, never mind that it was the largest banking conduit in Europe and now needed financial assistance from its parent, came as a total shock, akin to discovering a face you thought you were familiar with had suddenly grown an enormous protrusion," the Scotsman wrote at the time.
And, as grim news followed grim news that autumn, bank after bank - among them, most dramatically, Northern Rock - admitted that they too had their own Jersey-based shadow operations funding the mortgages that eventually blew up the British financial system.
The problems of the struggling banks mostly came down to the same thing: they borrowed money, processed it and lent it out via a giant financial sausage machine. That was not a problem as long as there was money available. As soon as the credit supply stopped, however, there was no meat to go in the sausages, and the whole machine seized up. So how come no one noticed what the banks were up to? They put the sausage machines in Jersey, in something called charitable trusts. When you create a trust, you no longer own your assets, so you do not have to declare ownership, but the trustee carries out the instructions you issued when you did own them. There is no public register of trusts.
Jersey's trust law allowed banks to obscure the vast number of mortgages they were issuing, making it look like HBOS was safe from the US housing crash when actually it had $30bn invested in American mortgages. This enthusiastic lending stripped banks of the cushions of cash they normally keep to protect them if their loans go bad. When the market collapsed, the banks were unprotected. They had been so greedy for business, they had undermined their own future.
Such misuse of trusts was not new. The US energy giant Enron had used Jersey to hide the extent of its debts prior to its collapse in 2001. What was new in the credit crunch was quite how much this chicanery ended up costing the British taxpayer.
On 17 February 2008, Britain said it would nationalise Northern Rock (which had its own Jersey trust named Granite), the first in a series of banks brought into public ownership. The final cost of picking up the pieces of these exploded banks was in the hundreds of billions of pounds. Jersey did not contribute a penny to cleaning up the mess it had made.
The US, Britain and the EU have since obliged Jersey to exchange information on any citizens using the island's banks, some of which now refuse to serve UK-resident clients.

This has all put Jersey officials on the defensive, and they have hired academics to combat their troublingly persistent critics. One report examined the impact of Jersey on the UK, and argued that it supported 180,000 British jobs. Another report last year suggested that Jersey could be central to attracting investment into Africa. A third report defended offshore finance, and dismissed the Tax Justice Network's calculation that tax havens hide up to $32tn from proper scrutiny.
"Their argument [that of the TJN] is largely based on the fact that it [offshore finance] is illegitimate and not transparent and I think that's just, like, so 10 years ago. These guys need to get up to speed," said John Harris, director general of the Jersey Financial Services Commission. "The requirements we put through are as strict as anywhere in the world, and a damn sight better than mainland economies."
Chief Minister of Jersey Ian Gorst and other officials insist that the island is now more transparent than many onshore jurisdictions. (In 2015, the island fell to 16th on the TJN's financial secrecy index, behind Germany, the US, Japan and the UK.) Gorst and his allies say that Jersey's new approach is shown in the case of General Sani Abacha, the brutal 1990s military ruler of Nigeria. Yes, Jersey looked after his money in the bad old days but, in 2014, Jersey returned £315m to the Nigerian authorities. It no longer wants that kind of client.
They insist that this is a reformed Jersey, running neighbourly policies with the rest of the world, filling a niche for a well-regulated offshore jurisdiction. But does that niche exist? If Jersey cannot act like a tax haven, what exactly is the point of it? That, anyway, is what the world's banks appear to have concluded.
The number of banks licensed on Jersey fell from 73 at the turn of the millennium to 33 last year. Bank deposits peaked in 2007 and by 2014 had fallen by almost 40% to £136.6 billion. The island's financial industry contracted by a third over the same period, and the number of its clients fell by a sixth in 2014 alone.
Meanwhile, the rest of Jersey's economy is worryingly hollow. One in 10 of its jobs are now based on zero hours contracts, compared to one in 40 in the UK.
One in 10 of Jersey's jobs are now based on zero hours contracts, compared to one in 40 in the UK
All of this makes it look less and less likely that Jersey will be able to raise the taxes it needs to fill its black hole, which means that there is a lesson here for Britain. With high property prices, a brain drain into financial services, successive governments favouring banking over other industries, and a revolving door between finance and public administration, the parallels between Jersey and its larger island neighbour are too obvious to ignore. In fact, the Tax Justice Network has a name for the phenomenon: "the finance curse".
"For two decades, I've heard Jersey politicians promising to diversify the island's economy, but the island is now more dependent on offshore finance than it was 20 years ago," Christensen said. "If George Osborne is serious about wanting to build a northern powerhouse, he should read up on the finance curse and take appropriate measures to tackle the dominance of the City of London."

* * *
                     Jersey, however, appears as determined as ever to ignore Christensen's warnings. The government has been touring the world in search of new business, in south-east Asia, the Middle East, in Russia and in Africa. "[The world] changed very dramatically during the financial crisis," Chief Minister Gorst told the assembly in June. "We are in a fight. We are in a fight for our survival. We are in a fight for jobs and the prosperity of our children."
His government is building new offices, to house the people who will move the money around, when it arrives. Key to this strategy is the Jersey International Finance Centre, a vast new project that will add half a million square feet of floorspace to the office buildings along St Helier's esplanade. The architect's plans for the first block show a glass and steel box, with a woman in high-heeled sandals striding briskly past, files under her arm. The sun is shining, the pavement is free of litter.
It looks lovely, but locals are not convinced, not least because there are as yet almost no companies to go into these offices. In June, some 3,000 protesters formed a human chain around the site and waved signs asking "What part of NO don't you understand?"
In October, a committee from the States Assembly said the project was not commercially viable, posed a considerable risk to the public purse, and would cost more money than it would earn. Only one tenant has signed up to lease premises in the new development, which looks extraordinarily speculative for a government already facing a cash crunch. Construction has begun anyway.
Perhaps Jersey has bet so much on finance that it can no longer afford to stop increasing its stake. It will have to keep doubling its bet until the money runs out. If it cannot live forever from finance, it looks like it is going to die in the attempt.

HMRC chief Lin Homer to step down; 
Head of HM Revenue and Customs quits after fierce criticism from MPs over failure to answer 12m tax inquiries.

Sean Farrell.

The chief executive of HM Revenue and Customs, Lin Homer, is leaving the role after four years in which she faced fierce criticism over HMRC's failure to answer millions of calls from the public and its handling of the HSBC tax scandal. 
She will step down in April and HMRC has begun looking for a successor. She joined HMRC in January 2012 from the department of transport and has spent 36 years as a civil servant and in local government. 
Homer said she was not looking for a new job immediately and would take a break over the summer. "After 10 years as a chief executive and permanent secretary in the civil service, the start of the next spending review period seemed to be a sensible time to move on. HMRC has secured ministerial support and funding for our ambitious transformation programme and it has the leadership team in place to deliver it," she said.
The government said Homer had achieved a record increase in total revenues and reduced error and fraud in tax credits. Customer service had recovered from a low of less than half of calls answered in 2011 to almost 90% answered in December 2015.
Homer, who was made a dame in the New Year honours list, has been the subject of political controversy during her tenure. She revealed in February that most UK clients of HSBC's Swiss business who settled with the tax authorities did so under an extraordinarily lenient agreement. Homer also apologised in November that HMRC's giant call centre had failed to answer a quarter of the 50m calls it received each year.
The chancellor, George Osborne, said: "Lin Homer has made a real contribution to public service modernisation and transformation. She has put the foundations in place that will see HMRC become one of the most digitally advanced tax authorities in the world."

Detroit confronts self-driving cars: can America's auto show survive the future?; 
The North American International Auto Show has reigned for decades as the premiere industry event, but Silicon Valley is threatening the crown.

Benjamin Preston.

An unspoken question hung in the frigid air of Detroit's largest auto show, as work crews fastened the last few bolts and polished down the displays. How long can the North American International Auto Show reign supreme?
 Related:  CES 2016: cars, virtual reality and a lot of hype
For those who like the status quo in the auto industry, these can be unsettling times. Gas prices have hovered at remarkable lows, Silicon Valley giants are breaking into the business and if some criers are to be believed, the revolution of self-driving cars is near. 
Most agree that autonomous driving technology - the stuff of self-driving vehicles  already in testing - is the force most likely to significantly change how people get around. 
The new challenger to the Detroit show's dominion over automotive pageantry is the Consumer Electronic Show, which was held last week at the Las Vegas Convention Center. There were a number of newsworthy unveilings and announcements at CES, ones which in years past would have likely appeared at an actual auto show.
General Motors introduced the production version of its all-electric Bolt. (Last year, the concept was revealed in Detroit.) Volkswagen showed off the BUDD-e, its electric micro-van concept, taking the opportunity to apologize again for having flouted emissions regulations. Ford and Google announced a partnership  that could speed up the official arrival of fully autonomous cars. General Motors and Lyft, the app-based taxi service, trumpeted a similar plan.
"CES has absolutely stolen some of the spotlight in terms of autonomous tech, in part because technology in general and automotive are becoming more and more integrated as time goes on," Ashkay Anand, an analyst for Kelley Blue Book, told the Guardian.
"We're at the point where CES is as important to the industry as many of the car shows."
For decades, the Detroit auto show - held each January at the sprawling Cobo Center - has been the premiere North American venue for auto makers around the world to display their latest wares. As the command center of the American auto industry, the midwestern city is ideal for American automakers, even if January isn't the best time to visit a state on the Great Lakes. If event organizers pumping $200m into a new layout (it had been the same for a few years) is any indication, they are not willing to cede the crown without a fight.
"There is an automotive push happening at CES, but when you look at our show, these are the real models that that technology shows up in," Max Muncey, public relations manager for NAIAS, said in an interview. 
"With over 40 model debuts, 90% of which are worldwide, and more than 30 CEOs on the floor, it's a couple of big days."
Accordingly, Detroit will showcase a couple of hi-tech heavyweights of its own. The Volvo S90 T8 Plug-in Hybrid, for example, will show off a semi-autonomous cruise control system in a new flagship sedan produced by the Chinese-owned Swedish company. Mercedes-Benz will be pulling the wraps off the 2017 E-Class sedan, which is expected to be equipped with autonomous components and which made a camouflaged appearance at CES last week.
Kevin DeSouza, a researcher for the Brookings Institute, said piecemeal introduction of autonomous technologies over the past few years - lane departure warning systems, speed-adjusting cruise control and automatic brakes - have made more comprehensive systems possible in what seems like a very short time. 
Automakers, he said, have become more comfortable with the Google model of doing things: introducing tech incrementally. They have also started presenting vehicles as platforms to customize with technology as buyers see fit.
 Related:  VW emissions scandal set to overshadow Detroit Motor Show
"Normally, emerging technologies are hyped well ahead of their prime time," DeSouza said. "With AVs [autonomous vehicles] we might actually see them on the roads sooner than most people predicted. 
"Technology components that support AVs have already been deployed and tested on our roads, so we did not have to wait to roll out the solutions all at once."
Most of the other introductions in Detroit will be fairly run-of-the-mill: conventional Buicks, Chryslers, Hondas, Fords and the like. The arrival of the Chinese-built Buick Envision, the first of its kind to enter the North American arena, is noteworthy but not an earth-shattering event. 
Bentley, Jaguar, Land Rover, Maserati, Tesla and Rolls-Royce will all eschew the show this year, but since Detroit tends to be a "people's car" sort of event anyway, the luxury marques probably won't go much missed.
But automakers have been known to stun with big surprises, as Ford did last year with its GT supercar debut. For the competitive gamblers out there, it's important to consider that the national average gasoline price, which on Friday dipped below $2 per gallon for the first time since 2009, has been low for a while. The solid bet assumes that any surprises will be more about horsepower and performance than technology and alternative fuels.
It's difficult for anyone to say where auto makers will pour their marketing dollars in a decade's time, or even a few years from now. Anand suggested that Detroit and other events like it have maintained their prominence despite any past or present uncertainty.
"For actual, market-ready product, shows still reign supreme," he said. "For now."

Debate tonight on 'press freedom in a surveillance state'; 
Speakers include Shami Chakrabati, Heather Brooke and Martin Bentham.

Roy Greenslade.

Tonight, the London Press Club stages a panel debate about the difficulties faced by journalists in seeking to exercise press freedom at a time of increased, and increasing, surveillance by the state. 
The main speakers will be Liberty's director Shami Chakrabati; the freedom of information campaigner, Heather Brooke, who played a leading role in revealing the MPs' expenses scandal; and the London Evening Standard's home affairs editor, Martin Bentham.
I am chairing the debate, entitled "Press freedom in a surveillance state", which will take place at London's Stationers' Hall, from 6.30pm for a 6.45pm start. (Networking and drinks begin at 8.30pm).
The event, held in association with the Society of Editors, could not be more timely. As London Press Club's chair, Doug Wills, observes: " Never has there been more passion from all sides about the conflicting demands of privacy, protecting sources and demands for full access for terrorism and crime investigators." 
One subject certain to come up will be journalistic concerns about the police's use of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa). 
Wills says that editors are also worried about the political pressure for watering down the freedom of information act. 
London Press Club members can book a free space by emailing info@londonpressclub.co.uk Non-members can book for £10 via Stationers.

VW global sales fell 2% in year emissions scandal hit; 
German carmaker sold 9.93m vehicles in 2015, but impact of diesel emissions test scandal would only have been felt in last few months.

Staff and agencies.

Volkswagen has said its global sales fell 2% last year as it struggled with the diesel emissions scandal. 
Sales volume dropped to 9.93m vehicles, from 10.14m the year before. The scandal  over software installed in its cars to cheat US emissions tests emerged in late September, so it might have only affected figures in the last months. 
Sales plunged 37% in Russia and 38% in Brazil as those economies slowed, accounting for much of the overall drop. Weaker sales in China, the source of much of the company's profits, also hurt. 
Deliveries rose by 1.2% in the US for the full year, though they fell slightly in December. The figures announced on Friday were for all Volkswagen's brands, including Seat and Skoda as well as luxury makes Audi and Porsche. Sales of V W brand vehicle fell sharper at 4.8%.
 Related:  Volkswagen criticized for withholding emails from states investigating scandal
"Delivering almost 10m vehicles is an excellent result, particularly in view of the continued challenging market situation in some regions as well as the diesel issue in the final quarter of last year," its chief executive, Matthias M¸ller, said.
In 2014, Volkswagen finished just behind Toyota in terms of vehicle sales, while General Motors was third. GM and Toyota are to announce full-year figures later this month. VW briefly pulled ahead for the first six months of 2015 but then slipped behind Toyota. The company originally set a goal of passing the Japanese carmaker by 2018, but since the emissions scandal broke has said it is placing less emphasis on sales numbers.
M¸ller said VW was working to change its culture to prevent future wrongdoing. The company has also commissioned an investigation into the scandal by US law firm Jones Day.
The US Justice Department is suing Volkswagen, saying it equipped 600,000 cars with software that turned off emissions controls when the vehicle was not on the test stand. Volkswagen says 11m cars worldwide have the software. It faces billions of dollars in potential fines and costs for recalls as well as lost sales.

LAPD chief treads fine line after seeking charges against officer for shooting; 
Police chief Charlie Beck has promised to act in cases where officer-involved homicides are unjustified but he knows he must bring the troops with him.

Andrew Gumbel in Los Angeles.

The last time a Los Angeles police officer faced criminal charges for shooting an unarmed civilian, it was 2000 and the city had just been shaken by a major corruption scandal involving officers framing suspects and dealing drugs right out of the evidence locker.
The case was a particularly egregious one : a plainclothes officer who shot a 65-year-old black man in the back four times in a dispute that began because the officer's unmarked car was blocking the middle of the street. 
Since then, more than 200 people have been shot dead by LAPD officers, about one-quarter of them unarmed.
Until this week, however, not one of the officers has faced the possibility of criminal prosecution. On Monday, the LAPD chief, Charlie Beck, said he was recommending charges against one of his own officers following an internal investigation into the fatal shooting of an unarmed homeless man in Venice Beach last May.
It appeared to be the first time an LAPD chief had ever made such a recommendation publicly, and it indicated a growing determination by the force's top brass to respond to criticism from both street activists and its own civilian oversight body, the Police Commission, over a disturbing increase in officer-involved shootings over the past year.
Brendon Glenn, a 29-year-old homeless man, was shot twice in the back outside a bar after a dispute with a bouncer. According to Chief Beck, Glenn was on the ground and trying to lift himself off his stomach when Officer Clifford Proctor opened fire. Both Glenn and Proctor are black.
Proctor has contended that he saw Glenn reaching for his partner's gun, but Beck said that video footage of the incident and the testimony of eyewitnesses including Proctor's partner failed to corroborate the story.
Chief Beck disclosed his decision to the Los Angeles Times on the eve of a scheduled appearance before the Police Commission. It was later confirmed by his own staff and by city officials. On Tuesday, Beck followed up with a request to the commission to delay its own investigation into Glenn's death until the district attorney's office had decided whether to take up his recommendation.
In common with other big-city police departments, the LAPD has generally stood by its rank-and-file officers, even in the face of emotional public protests and pressure from local politicians to take action to prevent the shooting of unarmed civilians.
This is not the first time, however, that Chief Beck has shown a willingness to draw a line between acceptable and unacceptable behavior in the ranks. Last April, he described the actions of an officer who had been filmed stamping on a suspect while he lay motionless on the ground as "not only beyond departmental policy but ... in fact criminal".
Just one day after Glenn's death in May, Beck said he was "very concerned" by what he had seen on surveillance footage and did not see "supporting evidence" to justify the shooting of an unarmed man.
The change in tone - a stark contrast to the rancid atmosphere between the police and the black community that led up to the 1992 LA riots - reflects Chief Beck's determination not to unleash the sort of anger and unrest that have rocked Baltimore, Chicago and Ferguson, Missouri, over the past couple of years.
At the same time, however, he has been buffeted by multiple competing pressures. While Black Lives Matter activists have organized protests and demanded accountability every time a black victim has been shot by a police officer, Beck also knows he will be lambasted by the powerful local police union if he utters a single critical word against an officer.
The union's view, widely shared by officers on the beat, is that policing high-crime communities is often dangerous and frightening and even if an officer makes a mistake it should not be categorised as a crime.
That explains, perhaps, why Beck was reluctant to criticise officers involved in another high-profile shooting, that of the mentally disturbed young black man Ezell Ford, even after the Police Commission overruled him and said at least one of the officers had acted outside department policy.
"In many ways, Beck is caught in the middle," said Joe Domanick, an author of acclaimed books about the LAPD. "If he acts in ways that will please the activists and the Police Commission, he'll get tremendous negative feedback from the union. He's an old street cop, he understands the power of the union."
The last year, however, has seen a spike in crime rates and also a disturbing increase in officer-involved shootings - almost 50 of them in 2015, compared with 23 the previous year. A handful, including Glenn's shooting and the killing of a homeless man on Skid Row last March, have incited particular public anger.
Matthew Johnson, the relatively new chair of the Police Commission, has called the increase in police shootings "an alarming development " and has commissioned a detailed analysis of the circumstances and outcomes of such incidents going back a decade.
Beck tends not to respond to such pressures in public but rather projects the image of a straight shooter who calls things as he sees them. He told the Los Angeles Times that the majority of officer-involved shootings are justified but that where they are not justified, "and on top of that not legal, I will also say that".
His initial comments about the Glenn case last May provoked the ire of the head of the police union, Craig Lally, who called them "completely irresponsible". Glenn's union-appointed lawyer, Larry Hanna, accused Beck on Monday of making a "political decision" by recommending his client be prosecuted.
 Related:  Police union scorns LAPD award for officers who use non-lethal force
Domanick said Beck had to be mindful of such criticisms, because previous LAPD chiefs who had stood up to the police union in the 1990s and early 2000s ended up isolating themselves and, eventually, losing their jobs. "You've got to bring the troops along with you," Domanick said.
Late last year, Beck inaugurated a new police medal for bravery in instances where an officer's decision not to use deadly force helped defuse a situation. That, too, provoked the union's displeasure. "A terrible idea that will put officers' lives in danger," the union called it on its website.

IAAF considered hiding Russian drug bans before London 2012; 
∑ IAAF feared Russians at risk of dying because of doping levels ∑ 42% of tested Russian elite athletes were doping in 2012, estimates showed.

Owen Gibson.

The IAAF considered hiding Russian doping bans from the public before London 2012 and recognised that more than 42% of all tested elite athletes from the country were cheating in the latest revelations to assail the tattered credibility of world athletics.
Internal documents obtained by the Associated Press also show that as far back as 2009 the International Association of Athletics Federations knew Russia's doping problem was so deeply entrenched it feared athletes were at risk of killing themselves through the use of EPO and blood transfusions. 
"This matter of the Russian athletes' blood levels is now so serious and is not getting any better (in fact possibly getting worse) that immediate and drastic action is needed," Pierre Weiss, then the IAAF general secretary, wrote in a 14 October 2009 hand-delivered letter to Valentin Balakhnichev, the Russian athletics president banned last week for life from the sport.
"Not only are these athletes cheating their fellow competitors but at these levels are putting their health and even their own lives in very serious danger," wrote Weiss, telling Balakhnichev that blood results from Russian athletes "recorded some of the highest values ever seen since the IAAF started testing".
Tests conducted at the 2009 world championships, where Russia won 13 medals, "strongly suggest a systematic abuse of blood doping or EPO-related products," Weiss added. It was not until November 2015, following the independent report by Dick Pound commissioned after an explosive ARD documentary, that Russia was banned from competition for state sponsored doping.
The latest revelations will only increase the pressure on the IAAF president, Sebastian Coe, before Pound unveils the second part of his report into systemic doping in Russia and related corruption at the IAAF on Thursday.
The source that leaked the documents believed they show some anti-doping officials did their best to do all they could to keep Russian cheats from competing. But they also show that many senior IAAF officials knew there was a major problem for at least six years and spent much of that time trying to cajole Russia into doing something about it.
An internal briefing in September 2012 for Lamine Diack, IAAF president at the time, estimated 42% of tested Russian elite athletes doped. Suspected doping in Turkey, Spain, Morocco and Ukraine also "is particularly worrying", it said.
 Related:  Russia accepts full, indefinite ban from world athletics over doping scandal
The IAAF confirmed to AP that the letters were genuine. The IAAF spokesman, Chris Turner, said they were a "clear, open warning" and insisted the IAAF has been "very strong" in dealing with Russia.
By 2011, two years after its launch, the IAAF's "blood passport" testing regime was starting to flag so many suspected Russian dopers that officials explored the idea of breaking their own rules and those of the World Anti-Doping Agency by dealing with some cases privately.
The notes proposed a twin track approach. The best known elite Russian athletes most likely to win medals in London would be banned in the normal manner but there would be a "rapid and discreet" handling of second-tier cases for less well-known athletes whose sudden disappearance from competition would likely pass unnoticed.
For those athletes who agreed to the deal, the IAAF would in turn "undertake not to publish the sanction," which would be shortened to two years from four, according to a note on 5 December 2011.
"These measures concern athletes without titles or major results. Their withdrawal from competition wouldn't necessarily attract attention," said a follow-up April 10, 2012, briefing note for Diack, marked "STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL."
The IAAF says the proposals were never put into practice. Balakhnichev told the AP they also never reached him. "There were no secret bans. At least I didn't know and didn't hear about there being any," said the Russian.

Turner said the December 2011 note was sent by the IAAF's anti-doping director at the time, Gabriel DollÈ, to Habib CissÈ, who was Diack's legal counsel. The follow-up note in 2012 was from DollÈ to Diack, Turner said.
Last week Papa Massata Diack, the son of Lamine, and DollÈ, head of the IAAF's anti-doping unit, were banned for their part in a scheme to cover up doping violations and extort money from the Russian marathon runner Liliya Shubokhova.
That report, by the IAAF's ethics commission, showed how CissÈ took over the management of all Russian blood profiles in 2011 in a move described as "unusual and inappropriate" by IAAF senior anti-doping official Thomas Capdevielle.
The IAAF said a colleague of DollÈ's in the anti-doping department objected at the time to the proposed non-disclosure of bans and was assured by DollÈ that sanctions would be published "which they were".
An IAAF spokesman said: "Every suspicious ABP profile was investigated in full accordance with IAAF Rules and the World Anti-Doping Code. All confirmed doping cases were publically sanctioned. Nothing was covered up."
In December, Coe's chief of staff Nick Davies was forced to stand down pending an ethics committee investigation into leaked emails that showed he discussed the possibility of managing the release of Russian bans to avoid negative publicity around the 2013 world championships in Moscow.
In his report last November, Pound revealed Russian doping on an industrial scale and said the London 2012 Olympics had been "sabotaged" by cheating and collusion. After Pound presents the second part of his explosive report in Munich on Thursday, the French prosecutor in charge of a criminal probe into corruption claims will also face the media.
French police arrested Lamine Diack last year amid allegations that he pocketed more than 1m euros to cover up doping cases, along with CissÈ and DollÈ. They also said Papa Massata Diack would be arrested if he set foot in France.

RBS sell warning spells trouble for George Osborne's budget; 
Chancellor could be announcing missed borrowing target and postponement of feel-good Lloyds retail offer in March.

Nils Pratley.

Sell (almost) everything, says Andrew Roberts, Royal Bank of Scotland's credit guru. Unfortunately for George Osborne this advice has arrived late in the day for a chancellor seeking to flog more than a few shares in RBS itself.
The Treasury managed to get rid of 5% of RBS last August at 330p, taking the state's stake to 73%, but since then nothing has happened. Nor will it if the RBS share price remains below 300p. 
The big idea last autumn was that the mere act of starting to sell shares in RBS would lead to better prices in future as the outside world came to recognise that the bank was escaping the clutches of the state and marching down the road to full privatisation. The theory was sensible but the practical fact of RBS's share price at 283p, within pennies of an 18-month low, surely disqualifies further sales for the time being.
 Related:  Sell everything ahead of stock market crash, say RBS economists
Delay to the RBS disposal programme was always possible. But flogging the last part of Lloyds Banking Group was supposed to be an easy task for Osborne. Suddenly, that ambition looks tricky with Lloyds shares at 69.3p. Under the drip-feed programme, which has reduced the state's stake to 9%, sales are prohibited below 73.6p, the break-even price.
And, if the drip-feed programme is stalled, can Osborne really go ahead with his parallel idea to exit Lloyds with a flourish this spring by selling £2bn worth of discounted shares to the public? Technically, he can. But it would be highly embarrassing, politically speaking, to sell Lloyds shares to private punters at a loss to the public purse.
A lot can happen in coming weeks. Stock markets could recover and Lloyds' full-year results, due next month, could be sparkling. But, as matters stand, Osborne is looking at the possibility that, in his March budget, he could be announcing he has missed his borrowing target and the feel-good Lloyds retail offer has had to be postponed. No wonder he sounded so gloomy at new year.

Scraping the oil barrel
How low can the price of oil, which approached $30 a barrel yesterday, go? Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs say $20. Standard Chartered thinks $10. Reinforcing the air of bearishness, BP has announced yet another round of job losses - some 4,000 posts will go, including 600 in operations in the North Sea.
In the current climate, almost any guess for the short-term oil price sounds credible. The world is producing about 1m barrels a day more than it currently needs; the Opec cartel is in chaos, unable to agree production quotas; and Iranian oil will arrive on world markets with the lifting of sanctions. As Standard Chartered rightly says, in this environment the oil price can be driven lower by financial factors, such as a strong dollar.
Remember, though, that the pressing question is not so much "how low?" but "for how long?" The answer to the latter question, unfortunately, is equally obscure.
It is possible to make an argument that the market could be under-supplied by the end of this year. Demand for oil is still rising - even in China, at least for now - and production in the US or Russia could fall with investment cuts.
That, at least, is the hope to which the producers cling. But, in truth, if their wishes are to be granted, it has to happen soon. Here's an industry insider's rule of thumb: if sub-$40 is the average price for this year, dividends are toast at all the major producers; and if sub-$40 extends into 2017, then there will be budget crises in Russia and a fair number of Gulf states.

'Triumph' for Morrisons
In the world of supermarkets, a land of shrunken expectations, a barely visible 0.2% rise in like-for-like sales counts as a triumph. Well, it does if you're Morrisons. The lift in the nine-week Christmas period was the group's first positive reading for four years.
But let's not be too churlish. Suddenly, Morrisons' balance sheet is starting to look like a port in a storm. From £2.34bn a year ago, the group now reckons debt will be £1.65bn-£1.8bn at the end of this month.
It helps, of course, that Morrisons has been flogging a few supermarkets, plus its convenience stores, but that reduction in borrowing represents progress. Even after a cut in the dividend last year, the yield is 3%. Decent balance sheet, safe-ish dividend and - possibly - stability on the sales line? It could be worse. Beleaguered Asda could yet turn nasty, but one can understand why Morrisons' shares rose 9%.

Apologies from ex-BBA chief
Bankers used to have great difficulty apologising but Angela Knight, their former lobbyist at the British Bankers' Association, barely stopped doing so yesterday. "I am so sorry I ended up at the BBA during the banking crisis. I'm so sorry it chose me to be its target," she told the Treasury select committee.
The MPs are assessing if Knight is a suitable chair of the Office of Tax Simplification. The BBA, supposedly in charge of Libor during the time of the rate-rigging scandal, has much to answer for, but Knight herself probably deserves a break. Lobbying for banks was not a pretty job, but it was never an illegal activity and shouldn't be a bar to fresh employment.

Government tax adviser 'sorry' for banking role during Libor crisis; 
Angela Knight, former head of British Bankers' Association, apologises to MPs and says she did her best 'in face of a hurricane'.

Jill Treanor.

The former head of the British Bankers' Association has repeatedly told MPs she was sorry that she ended up at the lobby group at the time of banking crisis and the Libor rigging scandal. Angela Knight, the former Conservative MP who ran the BBA between 2007 and 2012, faced questions on Tuesday from the Treasury select committee about whether her tenure at the association was a credibility issue for her. She disagreed.
MPs on the committee were taking evidence about her appointment as chair of the Office of Tax Simplification after a two-year stint at Energy UK. "I found myself in charge [at the BBA] at the time of the biggest banking crisis in history. I did what I could in the face of a hurricane," she said. "If someone who does a difficult job and finds themselves in a very tricky position does what they can, is thereafter told, 'You can't do anything else,' you'll never get anybody to do a difficult job again. I tried my best. 
"I am so sorry I ended up at the BBA during the banking crisis. I'm so sorry it chose me to be its target. I'm so sorry it took a trade association into a different era. I'm so sorry I never persuaded the authorities to take over [setting] Libor [rates] earlier and I'm so sorry the banks brought about [the] financial disaster they did."
Knight admitted that she wished she had been stronger in dealing with the problems that were uncovered with Libor, the regime for inter-bank interest rates, which at the time the BBA  administered. Knight had wanted the Bank of England to have observer status over Libor.
 She also said she had disagreed with the judicial challenge mounted by the banking industry over compensation for the payment protection insurance (PPI) scandal. The challenge was brought to a sudden halt shortly after Lloyds Banking Group started paying out compensation in May 2011. The mis-selling scandal has proved to be the most expensive in history, incurring fines and costs of £26bn and rising. 
Knight said she had wanted to resign over the PPI situation, but was asked to stay longer. She was prepared to quit her new role if there was political inference, she told the MPs.
During the financial crisis - which erupted within months of her taking charge at the BBA - Knight was regularly forced to defend the banking industry. She gave more than 800 broadcast interviews and made over 1,000 speeches.
The Treasury committee said it would publish a report following Knight's appearance. "A report on the committee's consideration of her personal independence and professional competence in the context of this role will be published in due course," it said.
Knight told the committee she had been encouraged to apply for the two-day-a-month role at the tax body as it was an organisation interested in promoting women into senior positions. "The OTS is not an organisation that decides on tax," she told the committee, adding that it was not set up to tackle tax avoidance and evasion.  
Last month, research by Reuters found that five major banks had not paid any corporation tax in 2014 in their UK arms. Other multinationals have also been found not to paying as much tax as might be expected. Knight was asked to look at whether the OTS had a role to play in tackling this area, and said she was appalled at stories about avoidance.

BMA tells striking junior doctors to defy Sandwell hospital orders to return; 
Midlands hospital that declared level four incident shortly after action started later stands down request.

Jessica Elgot, Steven Morris, Denis Campbell and Haroon Siddique.

Junior doctors were told to defy orders from a West Midlands hospital to return to their wards just two hours into a strike because of pressure on services.
In the first strike by hospital doctors in 40 years, as many as 38,000 members of the British Medical Association (BMA) across England began the action at 8am on Tuesday. The 24-hour strike over a new pay and working hours contract proposed by the government has meant hospitals have rescheduled about 4,000 non-emergency operations, 13% of the normal daily total. 
 Related:  Junior doctors strike in England - live updates
The doctors have agreed to provide emergency care for the first of two planned strikes this month but have threatened to withdraw those services in a third strike in February. 
Within two hours of the start of the strike, Sandwell hospital in West Bromwich said it had declared a level four incident and told its junior doctors they must attend work. The BMA, however, said they should refuse to do so until the seriousness of the situation had been established through the correct process. 
The hospital later stood down its request for doctors to return and said the order from the trust had not been politically motivated.
The original letter from the trust, dated Monday, told doctors rostered on for Tuesday that they should report for duty and said the hospital was already at escalation level four. "There are over 50 additional adult beds open with further medical outliers in surgery," it said.
Dr Roger Stedman, medical director at Sandwell and West Birmingham hospitals NHS trust, said Sandwell had had very high numbers of patients come to the hospital, and fewer than usual discharged. Staff striking at Birmingham City hospital were unaffected, he added.
Several junior doctors working for the trust questioned why the situation had been labelled an emergency, other than to undermine strike action.
"We received the letter emailed to us this morning, but it was dated yesterday and it said the situation had been ongoing for some days," one doctor, who wished to remain anonymous, said. "We were not called in at the weekends to provide extra cover to discharge patients, so why are we getting called in now? 
"This kind of situation happens all the time, especially in winter, over the whole NHS," he continued. "You'd expect it to happen several times a year. It's not at all unusual. I would imagine it's the same situation with hospitals across the country. So it's odd that this has happened to junior doctors on the day of the strike, when the issue of discharges has been going on for a few days."
Dr Anne De Bray, who has worked at the hospital for a year, said: "My first reaction was to cry when they called us back in.
"It's been well planned. They said they would call us individually if they needed us to come back into work. Instead they've emailed us a letter that was dated yesterday, 15 minutes before our picket line was due to start. 
"I just think they've not done it through the proper channels. If there had been a major incident like a terrorist attack or road accident we would drop our placards and head in."
Another junior doctor, who did not want to be named, added: "It is disgraceful they've tried to trick us back into work. The sad thing is some doctors would have fallen for it and gone back in. There is no major incident. It is just busy, which they have known about for a long time so they had plenty of time to put arrangements in place."
 Related:  Sandwell hospital faces bullying claims as junior doctors are told to stop strike
The BMA advised doctors not to return to work unless there was "a major unpredictable incident... taking place for a specific trust." 
Shortly after 4pm, the hospital's chief executive, Toby Lewis, said the hospital had managed to cope with the increased numbers and said he had agreed to stand down the requests for trainees to come in. 
Sandwell has fiercely denied it has any political motivation. "The trust is not party to the national dispute in any way," Lewis said. 
"The decisions made were made locally, and based on judgments about current and foreseeable pressure - a recognised basis for incident management. It would be irresponsible to wait for a position that was not recoverable and then act."
Earlier, Prof Sir Bruce Keogh, the NHS medical director, told hospitals they should order doctors back to work if services became dangerously overstretched.
In a letter to NHS trusts published by the Telegraph, Keogh said on Monday that doctors should be told to return if there was an "exceptional and sustained deterioration in performance", which the BMA said was meddling with doctors' right to strike.
Dr Johann Malawana, the chair of the BMA's junior doctors' committee, said Keogh's letter was a "last-minute, inept and heavy-handed attempt to bully junior doctors lawfully taking industrial action back into work".
The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, told the BBC he was disappointed the strikes had gone ahead. "This is a wholly unnecessary dispute," he said. "We want all NHS patients to have the confidence that they will get the same high-quality care every day of the week.
"At the moment, if you have a stroke at the weekends, you're 20% more likely to die. That cannot be right. The right thing to do is to sit round the table and talk to the government about how we improve patient safety and patient care, not these very unnecessary strikes."
The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, urged ministers to apologise for the failure to avert a strike. In a post on Facebook, he wrote: "No NHS worker takes lightly the decision to strike, but the blame must be laid at the door of this government for the way it has treated doctors and now seeks to smear them in the press. It is time for this government to apologise to junior doctors and negotiate a fair deal that gets our NHS working again."
Sir Robert Francis QC, who led the inquiry into the Mid Staffordshire scandal and is a non-executive director of the Care Quality Commission, said industrial action would compromise patient safety.
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "The only way that matters can be solved for doctors and patients is for talks to continue and for emergency care not to be withdrawn." 
Francis also said the government should listen to doctors and explain their offer more clearly.
"I quite understand why many of them [doctors] feel angry. They need to be listened to. One thing I would ask is done is that a better explanation is given to them all as to what the effects of any offer being made on them is personally. I'm not entirely confident that that has yet happened."
The BMA said it had been forced to act after ministers refused to heed its concerns that the new contract proposed by Hunt would be unfair on doctors and compromise patient safety. About 98% of its members backed strike action in a ballot in November.
They are opposed to Hunt's plan to classify Saturday as part of a junior doctor's normal working week, for which they are paid at only the basic rate. He also wants to see weekday evening hours classified as normal time extended from 7pm to 10pm, but junior doctors fear this will lead to cuts in their pay.

Hunt has offered to raise junior doctors' basic pay by 11% to offset the loss of overtime they currently earn for working in the evening and on Saturdays, and has promised that no junior doctor will be worse off under the new contract, which is due to start in August.
A new opinion poll suggests that despite Hunt's efforts to portray the walkout as politically motivated and based on misinformation from the BMA, the public is largely behind the strike. An Ipsos Mori poll for the Health Service Journal found that 66% of 869 people support action such as that planned on Tuesday - in which juniors due on duty in emergency care still turn up to work - with only 16% completely against.
Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said that while she sympathised with the junior doctors, industrial action would cause "a great deal of distress for many patients, who continue to be caught in the middle of this dispute". 
She urged the BMA and ministers to resume talks as soon as possible to agree a deal before the second of three planned strikes, from 26 to 28 January.

 Sandwell hospital stands down order for junior doctors to return to work  
Sandwell hospital has said it is no longer necessary for junior doctors to return to the wards, after earlier ordering medics back to their wards because of a "level 4" incident which saw increased numbers of patients over the past couple of days, with fewer patients than usual discharged.
The BMA said medics should not return to work because such situations were a regular occurrence, not an emergency.
The hospital's chief executive Toby Lewis has now said: 
Throughout today we have managed the increased numbers of patients admitted to Sandwell Hospital in recent days. 
The number we have been able to safely discharge has increased so that services are safe for tonight and tomorrow. 
We have agreed with the LNC Chair to stand down the request to some trainee doctors at Sandwell Hospital to come in and provide additional assistance. We will keep this situation under review.
Several junior doctors working for the trust questioned why the situation had been labelled an emergency, other than to undermine strike action. The hospital has fiercely denied it has any political motivation.
The statement says:
The Trust is not party to the national dispute in any way. The decisions made were made locally, and based on judgements about current and foreseeable pressure - a recognised basis for incident management. It would be irresponsible to wait for a position that was not recoverable and then act.
I want to thank those people who did come in to work on the Sandwell wards today. There has never been any doubt here that, in circumstances of difficulty, individuals would prioritise patients.

As expected, unfortunately, this action has caused disruption to patient care and we apologise to all patients affected.
It's a tough day, but the NHS is pulling out all the stops, with senior doctors and nurses often stepping in to provide cover. 
We are actively monitoring the situation across the country and the impact of the action is broadly in line with what we were expecting.

That means just over 15,800 doctors have not been on wards when they would have been expected to be.

A handful of junior doctors continued an unofficial picket in the rain on Westminster Bridge outside St Thomas' hospital on Tuesday afternoon. James Crane, a diabetes registrar, said the atmosphere at the official picket this morning was "subdued but resolved".
He said: "I think the DoH has been ignoring the real safety concerns of reducing the terms and conditions of our contract. Retention is a huge problem. We already struggle to maintain a work/life balance. 
"The contract they're trying to impose - the removal of severe financial penalties and safeguards and extending regular hours to Saturday - will only make that worse."

Crane said the worst case scenario was that Hunt retained his entrenched position. He explained that at the moment if a hospital made junior doctors work excessive hours they could complain to the BMA would get additional monies paid from a fine imposed on the trust. 
But under the new system the fine would go into a general account that the trust could use for staff training, which Crane said was not a sufficient penalty to deter excessive working hours.

You can read more by junior doctors on why they are striking, here.
Here is a sample:
 Dr Nina Beck, Bristol  
The government are also still not providing concrete assurances that crucial safeguards will be in place to stop us working unsafe hours. They propose a 'guardian' to ensure safe contract hours, as opposed to the current financial penalty scheme if we are contracted to work unsafe hours. Unfortunately all of us who work in the NHS know nothing but financial penalties can ensure our safe working hours and ultimately the safety of our patients. This is analogous to putting a speed limit in an area but not enforcing it with points, fines or penalties. It wouldn't work. Consider that when you're talking about a line of work like ours, this may be the difference between life and death decisions for our patients. We won't compromise on that, rightly so. I will not break my hippocratic oath to 'do no harm' as these contracts would see us do. The simple facts are this: who should the public trust? 54,000 doctors who commit their lives to helping others or a politician who has written a book on how to privatise the NHS? We would not be striking if we felt we had any other alternative.
 Dr Rae Wake, junior doctor, London  
There does seem to be some progress following the talks but on this issue of unsocial hours it feels like the government are digging their heels in for political reasons. They want to be able to say they achieved their manifesto of a '7 day NHS' but this poorly designed strategy will only create a disillusioned workforce ready to leave their profession and undermine the NHS further. They've got to listen to us on this.

Dr Marianne Hilton, 36, described the new contract for junior doctors as a "step towards dismantlement of the NHS". A qualified GP registrar since 2007, Hilton said the NHS is at breaking point and she no longer feels able to uphold the "do no harm" oath she took when she qualified. She said:
If it [the new contract] goes through I can no longer honour the oath I took to 'do no harm' - I'm exhausted and you don't have the safeguards in place and you're constantly bombarded with negativity by some of the media. It has become too much.

The BMA has said junior doctors who broke the strike at Sandwell hospital in the West Midlands, after the trust asked them to do so to help with extra demand, are likely to have faced significant pressure. 
A spokeswoman said:
We know from the ground that not all junior doctors returned to work. Those that did were likely to have done so due to the pressure placed upon them. There was still however, a significant presence from junior doctors at the picket lines throughout the day.

The World Medical Association (WMA), which represents physicians from different countries, has backed today's strike action. 
The WMA president, Sir Michael Marmot, said it was the organisation's policy that physicians might carry out protest action and sanctions in order to improve direct and indirect working conditions that might also affect patient care.
He added: 
In this case it is clear that patient care would suffer in the long term if the government's proposals to change the working hours of junior doctors goes ahead.
We note the widespread support given to junior doctors among the public and across the National Health Service and we would urge the British government to establish a new working relationship with junior doctors. It is essential that trust is restored on both sides for the sake of patient care.

Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust has issued a new statement saying it is still calling for striking doctors to return to work but hopes that by the end of the afternoon (the walkout is due to end at 8pm) they can stand down the "site recall".
The trust says it acted because of "considerable and unusual pressure", rebutting the idea that its move was a cynical ploy to break the strike. It also implied that a number of trainees did comply.
The chief executive, Toby Lewis, said: 
The Sandwell site remains under considerable pressure with 15% additional beds open after a week of very considerable demand from sick patients needing our care. The trainee doctors that attended exceptionally, and those pre-agreed to be there, have helped greatly today, along with consultant colleagues, to de-escalate the site.
We are optimistic that towards the end of this afternoon we will have achieved our discharge aims. That will provide a safe hospital overnight and tomorrow and we can stand down our site recall.
It is important to be clear that today has not been a major incident, but has been one of considerable and unusual pressure and we have acted, on clinical advice, to ensure that the position does not deteriorate, become potentially unsafe and destabilising neighbouring hospitals and GP services.

A blog post from Roy Lilley, the blogger that people in the NHS take most seriously (including top brass such as the NHS England chief executive, Simon Stevens), excoriates Jeremy Hunt for his handling of the junior doctors' dispute, sticks it to the BMA too (though less so) and depicts the bosses of NHS hospital trusts as important people rendered frustratingly powerless by events that affect them directly. 
All the hospital bosses he's spoken to - and he's very well connected - "are sick to the back teeth of the dispute and want to know who's going to pay for it. Trust boards are very cross", Lilley writes. 
Who does he blame? Jeremy Hunt, or the Tinkerman, as he likes to call him. 
It seems to me, there are two main issues in play. First, the Tinkerman's frustration that discussions about modernising the 2009 contract started back in 2012, got nowhere. Thus, he announced if progress wasn't made he would impose a settlement. That was a really stupid thing to do. I have no idea who advised him to do that but they are to industrial relations what Jeremy Clarkson is to the caravan trade. 
The second key issue? 
The Tory election promise, to extend NHS working to seamless-seven-days, creates an imperative to change junior doctors' out-of-hours/premium/overtime payments (call it what you will) to make it affordable within the existing cost envelope. This generates complexity around just how much they will earn and a working environment the docs don't trust. 
Ever robust in his views, Lilley sympathises with the bosses of hospitals, caught in the middle of a potentially protracted series of industrial action, whose job is difficult enough already. He says the end result of all this is that:
The row is about a political imperative (fair enough it's a democracy), over which the employers have no say, who have been forced into a dispute with the workforce union they don't want, who are railing against the Department of Health, who are not the employer, but calling the shots and the actual employer has to handle the fallout. Is that clear?

Outside South Kensington tube station in west London, dozens of junior doctors are gathered with placards from three famous local hospitals - the Chelsea and Westminster, the Royal Brompton chest hospital and the Royal Marsden cancer hospital. Every now and then a massive cheer goes up as drivers of passing cars beep in support.
The hospital consultants covering for the juniors have also been hugely supportive, said Lily Collins, an F2 junior working in community psychiatry at Chelsea and Westminster:
All the consultants have been so much behind us. They are the ones taking up the slack. They are doing our discharge summaries and saying we didn't realise how hard you guys work.
But, she said: "It's a misconception that we are not at work. It is the same level of cover as on Christmas Day."
There are juniors who are on call, who are joining the picket line when they are not needed. Most of the public are very supportive, she said, but there had been a mixed reception. "You can't expect everyone to be onboard, but we try to get them to understand the reasons."
Maria Walsh, also in her second year out of medical school, working in anaesthetics at Royal Marsden, said the strike is about a patient safety issue: "I wouldn't want to be operated on by someone who has worked a 12-hour shift.
"We are already overstretched. We work extra hours out of goodwill. It goes with the job." But under the proposed new contract "there is nothing to stop the trusts overworking us", she said.
The temperature had dropped and Collins was shivering. "But I'm going to be here until I'm too cold to survive," she laughed.

The picket at Sandwell, where junior doctors were ordered back to work, has now dispersed - the agreement was that they would stay until lunchtime. Doctors insisted they would have put down their placards and headed inside to help if there had been a genuine emergency. Some believe the trust was trying to trick them into going back to work. 
Speaking at the picket line before they packed away, Dr Anne De Bray, who has worked at the hospital for a year, said: 
My first reaction was to cry when they called us back in. I was really frustrated and sad that they were trying to call us back into work. 
There have been quite a few letters over the past week explaining the measures they were going to take to cover the strike. 
It's been well planned. They said they would call us individually if they needed us to come back into work. Instead they've emailed us a letter that was dated yesterday (Monday) 15 minutes before our picket line was due to start. I just think they've not done it through the proper channels. 
If there was a dangerous incident they should liaise with the BMA through NHS England to call off the strike. It's really busy in there and staying in hospital for longer is not ideal for any patient. 
If there had been a major incident like a terrorist attack or road accident we would drop our placards and head in. We have all brought out stethoscopes and a change of clothes. 
But the BMA have said there's no danger to patients. My team finished at 7pm three days last week, we were due to finish at 4pm. We do this and we don't get paid for it. 
 Another junior doctor, who did not want to be named, added: 
It is disgraceful they've tried to trick us back into work. The sad thing is some doctors would have fallen for it and gone back in. 
There is no major incident. It is just busy which they have known about for a long time so they had plenty of time to put arrangements in place.

Kearney pointed out that this is the first doctors' strike in 40 years and asked Hunt if he felt responsible.
Hunt cited more examples of higher death rates at weekends. "I can't in all consciousness ignore those studies, we've had three in the last two months. We have to do something about this. People get ill every day of the week," he said.
Patient safety is not at risk by the removal of some of the current safeguards, like financial penalties for trusts that overwork doctors, he insisted. "Why would I want to do that? This new contract reduces the number of hours junior doctors are required to work. We actually offered to put in financial penalties. 
"The BMA wanted the penalties to go to the junior doctors, and we say... you're creating a perverse incentive to actually work those hours that are too long."

At the moment, if you have a stroke at the weekends, you're 20% more likely to die. That cannot be right, and that's something every doctor wants to do.

 More than 150 pickets and related events - BMA  
The BMA says there have been more more than 150 pickets and "meet the doctor" events across England. It has also condemned attempts to "bully" doctors back to work.
 Dr Johann Malawana, the BMA junior doctors committee chair, said:
With junior doctors attending more than 150 pickets and 'meet the doctor' events up and down England, today's action sends a clear message to Jeremy Hunt and David Cameron. Junior doctors in their thousands have made it quite clear what they think of the government's plans to impose contracts in which junior doctors have no confidence.
"Today's action - one that the BMA has long sought to avoid - is a result of a fundamental breakdown in trust with junior doctors, for which the government is directly responsible. This has only been made worse by yesterday's last minute, inept and heavy-handed attempts to bully junior doctors lawfully taking industrial action back into work.
We deeply regret the level of disruption caused, but this is a fight for the long-term safety of patients and junior doctors' working lives. The biggest threat to patient care is the government's insistence on removing safeguards which prevent junior doctors from being forced to work dangerously long hours without breaks, with patients facing the prospect of being treated by exhausted doctors.

As well as standing outside picket lines we want to make a positive impact today and do things we don't usually get to, like getting doctors to join the bone marrow register and potentially save treatment.
These are measure we've been forced to take. The contract is not safe.

A junior doctor working for Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust, where strikers were told to go back to work because of high demand, has questioned why the situation has been labelled as an emergency. The medic, who wished to remain anonymous, told the Guardian:
We received the letter emailed to us this morning, but it was dated yesterday and it said the situation had been ongoing for some days.
We were not called in at the weekends to provide extra cover to discharge patients so why are we getting called in now? People called the BMA after they got the letters and we were told not to go back in.
This kind of situation happens all the time, especially in winter, over the whole NHS. You'd expect it to happen several times a year, it's not at all unusual. I would imagine it's the same situation with hospitals across the country, it happens very frequently. 
So it's odd that this has happened to junior doctors on the day of the strike, when the issue of discharges has been going on for a few days.

Since the dispute began in mid-September there has been a lot of confusion about who exactly counts as a junior doctor. Quite a few people have assumed the term refers to only young trainee doctors, fresh out of medical school, or those in the very early stages of training after graduation that - after about 15 years - usually results in doctors at last becoming senior doctors, ie consultants. 
Some newspapers certainly gave that impression, at least early on in this now long-running contract row. It's an easy mistake to make, especially when so many of the junior doctors who have given interviews to broadcast media have looked to be in their early 20s. However, actually far, far more doctors than that are classed, arguably unhelpfully, as "junior" doctors. 
So, to (try and) be clear: in the NHS, a junior doctor is any level or grade of doctor below a consultant. So any medic who is a foundation year 1 or 2 doctor, or house officer or senior house officer, or registrar or senior registrar - the last stop before consultant status - is a junior doctor, even if they are in their mid or even late 30s. Or, sometimes, in their 40s. 
There are about 45,000 of them across the NHS in England, of whom 38,000 belong to the BMA, and it was 98% of them who voted in November to strike in protest at the proposed new contract. 
It's easy for anyone not in the NHS or au fait with how medicine works to assume that junior doctors are all fairly young. To add to that confusion, all junior doctors are - technically at least - trainee doctors until they become a consultant, even if they are highly skilled and potentially in charge of busy wards full of medically needy patients, for example, as quite a few often are. A few readers have taken issue with me for referring in stories to junior doctors being "trainee doctors", which was my way of avoiding undue and potentially tedious repetition of the phrase "junior doctors". In my view medicine's crude distinction between junior and senior (consultant) doctors, shored up by a series of acronyms that denote (to insiders) how far a particular junior doctor has reached in their training, is outmoded, open to (clearly) misinterpretation and also patronising and wildly hierarchical. Surely someone can come up with a better way of telling the world how experienced (or not) a doctor is? 
But technically I am right to refer to them all as trainees, though I recognise how imperfect that is. The phrase I've used in many of my stories about the dispute over recent months, to try and convey the range of doctors covered by the term junior doctor, is "all doctors below the level of consultant". That's who they are, all 45,000 of them.

Striking junior doctors outside St George's hospital in Tooting, south-west London, have a smiling poo depicting the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt. 
The green posters that the striking doctors, some wearing their scrubs, are holding read: "We are one profession. We stand together."
Some doctors said they had never done anything like this before. 
Unlike a previous strike by nurses at the hospital, there was little singing or chanting outside the gates. No megaphone. It was an austere strike by doctors - some of whom have worked in the profession for many years - who feel the health service is coming under severe pressure. 
Holding aloft a smiling poo emoji that was meant to be a visual representation of Hunt, Emily, a junior doctor wearing a stethoscope around her neck, said: 
We get a lot of rubbish thrown at us.
We're intelligent people and now is the time to stand together. We believe we deserve to be treated better and support our colleagues as well.
Some colleagues wished them good luck, others brought out cups of tea for the striking doctors of the hospital, which has about 1,000 hospital beds and is known for providing regional and national specialist care in cardiac, neurosurgery and cancer services.

Justin Madders, a member of Labour's shadow health team, writes in the New Statesman today:
Speak to any junior doctor and they'll tell you the last thing they want to be doing is withdrawing their labour, but the truth is they feel like Jeremy Hunt has backed them into a corner and left them with no other way to get their message across.
 There remains significant concerns with the proposed new contract that the government is trying to impose on junior doctors - not least the impact on patient safety as a result of junior doctors being forced to work excessively long hours - but today's industrial action has become about so much more.
 Junior doctors tell me they feel like they are the first line of defence for the future of the NHS. They feel like if they don't stand up to the government now, then next it'll be the nurses, the midwives and the healthcare assistants. Whether that assessment is right or wrong, it is a remarkable situation for junior doctors to find themselves in. Trust has been damaged, let us hope it is not irreversible.

With a stethoscope around his neck, Richard Sykes, a senior house officer in elderly care at St George's hospital, in south-west London, said Jeremy Hunt had approached the negotiations "with a sledgehammer". 
The reason that we're striking is we feel the government is trying to impose an unsafe contract on junior doctors which massively squeezes [the NHS] and doctors who feel undervalued and abused by the system.
Jeremy Hunt wants to unilaterally impose a contract which will further stretch tired and overworked junior doctors in a time of austerity.
If Jeremy Hunt had come to us and said: 'Your elderly patients don't all get seen in the weekend and we want to change that,' that's a serious rational concern that we could have addressed.
But he's using rubbish statistics to push his own political agenda.
I think stretching what is currently a five-day cover without any more doctors or support services would reduce continuity of care and efficiency.
He said Hunt was using "intellectually immoral" arguments to suggest there was not a seven-day NHS, and calling for the same services on weekends as weekdays without providing the infrastructure. 
As Sykes handed a passerby a leaflet he said: "Sorry we're not at work today."

Handing out stickers to passersby in the bitter cold outside St George's hospital in Tooting, south-west London, GP trainee Miranda Lewis, who has been at the hospital for 18 months, said: 
I think it's really sad that it's come to this but unfortunately we have to take this extreme action after negotiations broke down. It's all about patient safety. And for juniors coming through we have to protect the NHS. 
Today my ward has four consultants. So more doctors with experience so I have no doubt patients will be looked after. We're sorry patients have had routine checks and operations rescheduled. 
Most of these people coming in are staff. Some came in before 8am to do checks. We're feeling slightly undervalued and work above and beyond the care of duty. The smear campaign by government and in the media makes us feel so undervalued. 
As staff passed around cups of coffee to keep doctors warm, cardiothoracic registrar James Barr told the Guardian: 
The infrastructure is not there, the beds are not there. We run a seven-day service. I think the issue is in our service we struggle to run a five-day service.
We run electives Monday to Friday. The idea of rolling out elective and clinical every day, it will be difficult and affect training of staff. And there will be less continuity of care. The research isn't there.
At the moment it is being run on a shoestring. Compared to France and Germany the proportion of GDP spent on healthcare is much lower.
Also it will be hard to attract students when we will leave with a huge student debt of £80k and starting salary of £22k.

A lot of us are just fed up with constant worsening of our pay, our conditions. There was the changes to our pensions, the continued pay freeze across the entire public sector. We've found it to be the last straw. It endangers patients as we will be working much longer hours. Also it endangers our quality of life, if they aren't going to pay us any extra to come in on Saturday and Sundays when we're already working full shifts, nights, weekends anyway and it's making us work harder and harder for less and less money.

 BMA says Sandwell doctors shouldn't go back  
The BMA has advised its junior doctors not to respond to the request by Sandwell hospital for some of them to return to work because of high demand. 
The hospital said: "We decided to require trainee doctors allocated to ward work to attend Sandwell during today's strike."
A BMA spokesman said: 
Junior doctors should continue with industrial action until NHS England has confirmed and the BMA has agreed - via the agreed escalation process - that a major unpredictable incident is taking place for a specific Trust. The BMA will notify members as soon as such an incident is in place.
 It also referred strikers to its legal advice on the issue.

Prianka Padmanathan, 26, had tears in her eyes as she explained why she was on the picket line outside Bristol royal infirmary rather than at work.
It feels horrible but I don't think we have any choice. The new contract doesn't have in place the safeguards to stop us working dangerous and excessive hours. I feel that it's unsafe for the patients.
The government is selling it as creating a seven-day NHS. The problem is they are not prepared to provide any extra resources - no extra doctors or nurses, porters or anyone else. I don't think it's possible to improve services this way.
Padmanathan is a foundation year-two doctor undertaking research at Bristol University and working in the medical admissions unit at the BRI. She said most of her contemporaries would not be working in the UK in the next few years but heading abroad.
There's already a huge recruitment crisis among doctors. Under this new contract it will become almost impossible. Out of my year group there's about 40 of us. I know about five who have applied for a job in the UK. The majority are planning on travelling abroad. They are so worried about the situation. Hopefully we may persuade some of them to come back. I know the majority out in New Zealand and Australia won't come back.
Sarah Ibitoye, 29, an acute medicine registrar at the BRI, said: 
We feel we've come to the end of the road. Even though it's not what we want to do, we feel we have no other choice. It doesn't feel very nice being on strike. It's the first time I've ever done anything like this. Like all my colleagues I do this job because I love it. I like trying to help people; the idea of being out here not doing my usual job is not a nice feeling.
At the moment the hours I work are tough but they are OK. There are already shortages. I work in the respiratory department. That has taken its toll. We do often stay after our rota hours to get the work done. My fear is that if a lot of people who are threatening to leave the country do so, next year will be even worse. There will be far more shortages, the chances of staying late will increase. At least now we know if we stay late those hours are monitored. The trust investigates why we go over our monitored hours and try to make changes. If that monitoring is gone, the ability to recognise a problem and make a change will be gone. That is frightening really. I know when I'm tired I'm not as effective in my job. I don't want to put myself in that position where I feel I'm doing extra hours all the time and it changes the way I work.
Luke Carter, 27, a core medical trainee, said: 
I'm against the government's ideological push towards privatisation. If they get this contract for junior doctors through, the consultants will be next. If there's a new consultant contract, that will be the end of the NHS as we know it. We're lucky as doctors - we have a voice, we can fend for ourselves. But there's a lot of people in society who don't have that voice - who are being trampled on by the government. We do a difficult job. We get paid well. But I think the government should be honest if it wants us to work longer hours. If that's what they want, they should say that.
Elsewhere in the city there were pickets outside Bristol's famous children's hospital, the maternity unit St Michael's and the eye hospital.
Lin Clark, a retired public services worker, arrived with (slightly burnt) mince pies. "I was in hospital with my mother recently and I see how hard the junior doctors work," she said. "I'm 100% behind them. This new contract is all about the government privatising the NHS."

Raymond Tallis, the former professor of geriatric medicine at the University of Manchester and a consultant physician, said he had been "radicalised by the brutal assault on the NHS" by the Tories. 
"I've not marched since I was a student but I was radicalised as a result of Andrew Lansley's Health & Social Care Act - it's a direct assault on the principles of the NHS," he said on the picket line with junior doctors from Stepping Hill hospital in Stockport. 
He added: 
The greatest threat to patient safety is cuts in funding, putting things out to market. The private sectors picks things up and puts them down. The Tories' plans are a frontal assault on the values of the NHS - it's a war of values against prices.

 Midlands hospital orders striking doctors in  
Sandwell hospital in the West Midlands says it has ordered some of its junior doctors to come to work because of high demand.
Dr Roger Stedman, medical director at Sandwell and West Birmingham hospitals NHS trust, said: 
Over the last two days we have had very high numbers of patients come to hospital, and fewer than usual discharged. 
Because of that we decided to require trainee doctors allocated to ward work to attend Sandwell during today's strike. Staff taking action at City are unaffected. We would like to thank local doctors' representatives for their constructive support and advice.

Andy Beamish, surgical registrar based in Sweden is back in the UK to support strike action. He splits his time at the royal college of surgeons and a hospital in Gothenburg. 
Holding leaflets that read "we are one profession we stand together" and dressed in his scrubs, Beamish said: 
I'm here because I believe so strongly what the Department of Health, Jeremy Hunt and the government is doing is so detrimental to patient care and the NHS as an institution and also as a sideline to us and working patterns.
It will be so damaging to those things that not causing a minor disruption today would be immoral and letting things go the way they are.
After a few years in surgery, and I know from many years of experience, sometimes an operation can kill someone. You need to make decisions knowing you're capable and not exhausted working 13 hour shifts.
It's dangerous not just to my patients and the NHS, but to us. Driving home late after a shift and our concentration levels is compared [as dangerous as] to drink driving.

At St Thomas's hospital in central London the 20-odd junior doctors on the picket line have been joined by members of the Lambeth branch of the Keep Our NHS Public campaign group, several people from the National Gallery Former Strikers group and a few members of the PCS union.
The hospital's location, opposite the Palace of Westminster, means there are also a few journalists including Robert Peston, now of ITV, and his crew. The mood is upbeat as a few motorists crossing Westminster Bridge toot their support. One British Medical Association steward helps picketers - most of them in their scrubs with stethoscopes around their necks - forget the cold by handing round a box of croissants and Jaffa Cakes.
A delegation of senior Green party figures, including Caroline Lucas MP and leader Natalie Bennett, got a warm reception from junior doctors glad of some political support.
In his thick winter coat, gloves and BMA armband, Dr William Turner, a 31-year-old trainee anaesthetist, is one of the junior doctors on strike.
His main worry, he says, is that the proposed new contract will result in a 30% pay cut and remove safeguards that currently prevent juniors being forced by their hospital to work dangerously long hours. 
That will lead to doctors potentially working 80 to 90 hours a week. That will result in tired doctors on the wards and we know that tired doctors make mistakes, so ultimately it's putting patients' lives at risk.
Turner's normal working day involves learning his trade during operations of all sorts, from a hernia repair to a bowel resection, lasting between four and 10 hours.
The best kind of strike is one where you don't have to deliver [actually walk out]. We are all here today with a heavy heart. No junior doctor goes on strike lightly. It takes an awful lot to push junior doctors into the position where they are ready to stand on the picket line and not treat patients. But that's the position we are in because we have been pushed into it by the government.

The Royal College of Midwives (RCM) has expressed its support for today's industrial action. 
Jon Skewes, director of policy, employment relations and communications at the RCM, said: 
We stand shoulder to shoulder with our NHS colleagues on this issue, and the Royal College of Midwives offers its support to the junior doctors. Like midwives who took strike action over the past year I know that patient safety will be the number one priority for the junior doctors, and that steps will be taken to ensure that those who need care will receive it.
These hard working health professionals are facing attacks on their pay, including on payment for working unsocial hours. This is also an issue facing midwives and other health professionals in the NHS, who are facing being paid less for working in the evening, weekends and at night.

Sophie Herbert, a junior doctor at St George's hospital in Tooting, south London, said: 
I'm here because the government had failed to offer meaningful negotiations about a contract that is unsafe.
They are making the working conditions for doctors and nurses so difficult that there's an exodus of these highly trained individuals to other countries and careers. We're already contending with overwhelming staff shortages and we are already at breaking point, we can't do any more. That is why we're here.
We've been here since 8am and we'll be here until 12pm.

Today's strike isn't just affecting acute hospital trusts. Mental health services are being disrupted too. 
Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health NHS Trust, in north-east London, expected three-quarters of its 65 junior doctors to be on strike today. "We are anticipating around 75% of the 65 juniors to take industrial action. A small number are choosing not to strike, including some vacant junior doctor posts which are filled by locus", it said in a statement. It has cancelled some routine community and outpatient clinics "to minimise patient inconvenience", though stresses that all essential services will be covered by appropriate staff. 
In addition, "services for children and adolescents, working age adults and older people are all affected in some way by the industrial action. Planned outpatient appointments and domiciliary visits have been postponed and rearranged where possible, and consultants and specialty doctors are stepping in to support the safe provision of the service", adds the trust, which treats 155,000 people a year at its more than 40 sites 
Dr Jonathan Bindman, its medical director, said: 
Thanks to the goodwill of our consultant colleagues we are able to cover a good number of the essential junior doctors' roles. Of course, services like emergency assessments will be unaffected, and we will endeavour to provide as comprehensive a service as possible in the circumstances. In addition, we are ensuring that essential inpatient services will be covered by consultants, so care for our most vulnerable patients will not be affected. 
It is a similar picture across the capital at the South London and the Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, the NHS's largest mental health trust: 
During the industrial action, the trust is planning to deliver a reduced service that will cover emergency services only (similar to Christmas Day cover). This will include emergency admissions, place of safety suites, and psychiatric liaison support in our partner trusts' accident and emergency departments through on-call arrangements. Across the trust, this may mean that some routine clinics and community services could be cancelled.
Whilst we will not be running a full service, consultants will be working with nursing staff and other health professionals to ensure that patient care is not compromised. The trust employs 225 junior doctors and we recognise the right of these staff to take part in industrial action following the recent BMA ballot", the trust said in a statement.

Dagan Lonsdale, 32, a specialist registrar in intensive care medicine, based at St George's hospital in south London, explained to the Guardian why he is striking and what he will be doing today:
Doctors do not have a mass media machine. We do not have the powers of spin at the disposal of the Department of Health. What we do have is years of training in the evaluation of evidence and communication with people. Today, I will use these skills in a new way.
I will be outside my local tube station taking part in a nationwide campaign called Meet the Doctors. I will offer, to anyone who wishes to listen, to explain all of the issues that have led us to this situation.
No spin, just facts. I will explain how the removal of safeguards on doctors' working hours will put patients at risk, how we already have a seven-day NHS, how I already work weekends and nights, and that the new contract will not change this. I will explain that doctors are working at the very limit of what is possible and that a move to stretch them further is dangerous.
I will say that we have tried to explain all of this to the government, that we tried negotiating and they did not listen, that 20,000 of us marched in the streets of London and they did not listen, that 98% of us voted for the strike because this contract is so unsafe and unfair, and still  they will not listen. I will explain we are left with no choice but to take industrial action.

Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, the NHS medical director, has told hospitals to order doctors back to work if services become dangerously overstretched. In a letter to the directors of NHS, published by the Telegraph, he said doctors should be told to return if there is an  "exceptional and sustained deterioration in performance".
The BMA said Keogh was meddling with their right to strike.
Sir Robert Francis QC, who led the inquiry into the Mid Staffordshire scandal and a non-executive director of the Care Quality Commission, said industrial action would only "compromise patient safety".
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme he said: 
The only way that matters can be solved for doctors and patients is for talks to continue and for emergency care not to be withdrawn.

While Labour and the Liberal Democrats are sympathetic towards the junior doctors, they are not 100% behind them. Two parties have no such equivocation, though. They are the Green Party and, unsurprisingly, the National Health Action Party (NHAP), the small party dedicated to saving the NHS which fielded some candidates at last May's general election. 
Caroline Lucas, the Greens' only MP, and other leading party figures will show their support for the striking doctors today by joining the picket line at St Thomas's hospital in central London, directly opposite the Palace of Westminster on the other side of the Thames. 
The Brighton Pavilion MP sees today's strike as "healthcare professionals standing up to the bully boys around the Cabinet table. We fully support the action being taken by junior doctors today. This strike is happening because the government is failing to address very serious concerns around safe working conditions, while failing to offer proper recognition for those working unsocial hours," she said. Lucas added: 
Ministers have treated junior doctors with contempt and subjected them to a campaign of misinformation. It's no wonder they're at the end of their tether. This contract change is part of a wider government assault on our health service. 
She will be joined outside St Thomas's by Natalie Bennett, the Green Party leader; Baroness Jenny Jones, a London Assembly member and Sian Berry, the party's candidate to become Mayor of London. 
NHAP co-leader Dr Clive Peedell, an NHS oncologist, says the strike is "a referendum on the government's stewardship of the NHS". 
In his view: 
Junior doctors have been left with no choice but to take industrial action. The government has not compromised on its agenda to force junior doctors into working more hours for less pay, so that it can drive through its 'enhanced seven-day services' manifesto pledge which makes no sense in the context of a £22bn NHS efficiency savings program.
Peedell, who will be on the picket line outside University College London Hospital today, added: 
Despite the rhetoric from the Department of Health and NHS Employers, this remains an unfair and unsafe contract. Any potential inconvenience caused to patients by industrial action will be minor in comparison to the catastrophic long term risks to patient care resulting from an exodus of NHS juniors doctors if this contract is imposed. 
block-time published-time 7.39am GMT 
At 8am, today junior doctors begin the first in a series of three strikes over planned changes to their contract - the first walkout by junior doctors in 40 years. The dispute between the British Medical Association, which represents 38,000 of the 45,000 junior doctors in England, and the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has become increasingly embittered and this time, unlike when a previous walkout planned for 1 December, there has been no last minute reprieve. 
On Monday, NHS England said that 1,425 inpatient operations and procedures had been cancelled as a result of the strike alongside 2,535 outpatient ones. It said that 3,400 of the cancellations were today and 654 - 192 inpatients and 462 day cases - are in London. 
The postponed operations amount to about 13% of the normal daily total of 30,000. 
Across Greater Manchester, more than half (54%) of planned surgery and "non-urgent day-cases" have been cancelled. Approximately 11% out-patient appointments have also been cancelled.
Emergency care is excluded from today's industrial action but is likely to be affected nevertheless with NHS England saying hospitals would generally be under additional pressure.
There are believed to be around 100 pickets, at least, planned outside hospitals.
We will be providing live updates from picket lines and on how the NHS is coping at a time when increased winter demand has already put a strain on services.

The Revenant takes 2016 Golden Globe's top prizes as Gervais skewers the stars; 
From the show's opening monologue, Ricky Gervais left Hollywood's biggest stars gasping in shock, delight and outrageFull list of Golden Globes 2016 winnersRead our live blogRicky Gervais's opening monologue pulls no punches Stars on the red carpet - in pictures.

Scott Bixby in New York.

Branded as "the biggest party of the year" by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the Golden Globe Awards are traditionally viewed as the fun, slightly tipsy cousin of Hollywood's awards show circuit.
That didn't lessen the delight of the team behind the night's biggest winner, The Revenant, which won a fleet of top prizes: awards for director Alejandro Gonz·lez IÒ·rritu, star Leonardo DiCaprio, and the top award of the night: best dramatic motion picture.
With a three-course dinner, free-flowing champagne and famously outrÈ hosts, the Golden Globe Awards are a chance for the biggest stars of film and television to let their hair down, rip shots with Amy Schumer and take a selfie with Gael GarcÌa Bernal - after all, it's not like it's the Oscars - and a chance for the viewing public to watch overserved celebrities embarrass themselves on live television. 
This year's awards were no exception, largely due to the antics of host Ricky Gervais, whose antics at the 68th annual Golden Globes in 2011 lead to ¸ber-producer and Hollywood kingmaker Harvey Weinstein threatening to have him killed. From the show's opening monologue, in which Gervais targeted Caitlyn Jenner, worst-film-ever contender Pixels and the rest of the "disgusting, pill-popping, sexually deviant scum" assembled in the ballroom of the Beverly Hilton Hotel, to his deliciously uncomfortable introduction of Mel Gibson, LaLaLand's bÍte noire left Hollywood's biggest stars gasping in shock, delight and outrage.
To be fair, Gervais, who predicted that his return would make him "a bigger target than El Chapo", did warn them:
As presenter Amy Adams told Ryan Seacrest on the red carpet: "I don't think [Gervais] goes away for a couple of years and comes back without something to say."
Even the head of the body in charge of the awards didn't escape a barb. "The Golden Globes doesn't have an In Memoriam section to get you all depressed," Gervais said. "Instead, we let the president of the Hollywood Foreign Press say a few words."
"Thank you for your support," deadpanned Theo Kingma, the president in question.
Personal scandals were a rich comedic vein, cheerfully mined. At one point, Gervais recalled the travails of actor Charlie Sheen, whom Gervais had targeted in his much-ballyhooed monologue at the 2011 Golden Globes. "Joy and Trainwreck," Gervais said, introducing two nominees, which he noted were "not the names of Charlie Sheen's two favorite hookers".
He also introduced nominee Matt Damon as "the only person that Ben Affleck hasn't been unfaithful to". Damon, a longtime friend of the recently single Affleck, could barely keep himself together when he introduced best motion picture, musical or comedy nominee The Martian.
The high point of Gervais' hosting may have been his introduction of the long-dormant Mel Gibson, whose alcohol-fueled anti-Semitic tirade in 2006 provided an entire awards season's worth of fodder for the comedian. "I'm sure it's embarrassing for both of us, and I blame NBC for this terrible situation," said Gervais. "Mel blames - well, we know who Mel blames." Still, Gervais qualified: "I'd rather have a drink with him in his hotel room tonight than Bill Cosby."
After introducing Gibson, Gervais made sure to ask an important question of the former action star: "What the fuck does 'sugar tits' even mean?"
Gervais was, to his credit, eminently more watchable than most of the stars whom the evening was ostensibly celebrating. The first presenters, actors Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill, kicked off the award for best supporting actress in a motion picture with an extended bit involving Hill dressed as the bear from The Revenant. Although the majority of the 22 Jump Street star's jokes were silenced by network censors, the at-home audience's annoyed confusion was manifest in Jane Fonda's face.
After Italian composer Ennio Morricone won the Golden Globe for best original score for his work on The Hateful Eight - apparently named after the number of drinks imbibed by Quentin Tarantino - the film's director gave a frantic, disjointed speech on Morricone's behalf. "When I say favorite composer, I don't mean a 'movie composer'. That's ghetto," said Tarantino. "I'm talking about Mozart, I'm talking about Beethoven, I'm talking about Schubert. That's who I'm talking about."
Jamie Foxx, who had presented the award, returned to the stage after Tarantino was played off, with shaken head and a single word: "Ghetto."
A few well-cast presenter pairings did, however, keep the portions of the evening not hosted by Gervais from riding off the rails.
Actors Eva Longoria and America Ferrera, in a callback to the incident when the official Golden Globes Twitter account mistook Ferrera for Gina Rodriguez when she announced the list of 2016 nominees, introduced themselves with reminders to viewers at home that they were not other Latina actors one might lazily mistake them for. "I'm Eva Longoria, not Eva Mendes," said Longoria, to which Ferrera replied: "And I'm America Ferrera, not Gina Rodriguez." Longoria then kept the joke going by reminding the audience that "neither of us are Rosario Dawson".
Jennifer Lawrence, winner of the Golden Globe for best actress in a comedy film, and Amy Schumer, who told Ryan Seacrest on the red carpet that her "vagina itched today", took a similar tack, humorously mocking Hollywood's treatment of women.
"As women in Hollywood, people have a lot of preconceived notions about us," Lawrence said.
"Yeah!" responded Schumer. "Like, they're just like, 'Oh, Jenny! You're just, like, so pretty, and everyone likes them and wants to hang out with them, and they seem so fun to be around, and they should be models.' Like... " she faded off, staring in mock anger at the audience, who were largely in stitches.
True to form, some off-the-cuff celebrity moments were more entertaining than the anodyne nominee introductions onstage. Leonardo DiCaprio's response to Lady Gaga's Golden Globe win, for example:
As for the awards themselves, there was little indication that critics of the perceived lack of diversity among the nominated actors had their complaints heard. There were almost no non-white nominees in the film categories - Straight Outta Compton, the well-received biopic about the rise and fall of hip-hop group NWA, was snubbed when the Golden Globe nominations were announced, and Idris Elba, a supporting actor nominee for Beasts of No Nation, was also passed over in favor of Sylvester Stallone. Denzel Washington, who won the honorary Cecil B DeMille Award for "outstanding contributions to the world of entertainment", was the only film actor of color to take home a statuette.
A notable exception was Taraji P Henson, winner of the Golden Globe for best actress in a television drama. "Cookies for everyone tonight!" Henson cheered. "My treat."
In closing the evening, Gervais perhaps best summed up the import of the Golden Globes as the unofficial kickoff of awards season - the months-long period when the world's most overpaid and overprivileged people drape themselves in finery and soak up each others' awesomeness - with a simple shrug.
"From myself and Mel Gibson, shalom."

State of the Union pledge-by-pledge: has Obama kept his promises?; 
As Obama prepares for his final State of the Union speech, the Guardian has examined his previous major addresses to see how many of his pledges have been kept in 27 key policy areasPromises, promises: how Obama's State of the Union pledges were kept... or not.

Healing America
                     Guardian verdict: The implication then was that these challenges, though time-consuming, would eventually be met during his presidency. Instead, in previewing his final State of the Union in 2016, Obama acknowledged much remains: "I want to focus on ... what we all need to do together in the years to come: the big things ... that's what's on my mind".

Fair pay
                     Guardian verdict: Obama has led calls for equal pay for women and led by example in the battle to raise the national minimum wage by acting independently for federal workers.

Brazil's Carnival lovers face sobering moment as country braces for recession; 
Austerity does not come naturally to Brazilians, but attitudes are changing as economy suffers what is forecast to be the deepest crisis in more than a century.

Jonathan Watts in Rio de Janeiro.

When it comes to mood making in Brazil, there are few institutions that can match the samba schools of Rio de Janeiro. 
For a week each year at Carnival, they embody exuberance with a pulsating parade of spectacular floats, gyrating dancers and bateria throbbing with the rhythms of tamborims, chocalhos, surdos and drums.
But even these professionally upbeat performers are wondering how long the party can last as the country's economy suffers what is forecast to be the deepest recession in more than a century.
Just like businesses and consumers across South America's most populous nation, some schools are having to trim their costs ahead of next month's show at the SambÛdromo.  
Compared to last year, the Mangueira school, for example, will have six instead of seven floats and 4,000 instead of 5,000 dancers and musicians. Velvet has been replaced by cheaper fabrics. Another school, Beija Flor, is renegotiating contracts. 
Mangueira's director Junior Schall blamed the austerity on old unpaid debts and new financial "strangulation" caused by falling sponsorship and local government funding that has yet to materialise. 
This year will probably be OK, he said, but in the future all 12 of the main samba schools are reconsidering how they do business.
"The general consensus is that in the coming five to 10 years, we'll have to rethink Carnival in Rio, because of the financial strangulation. It's hard now, but it might become unviable in the near future," he warned in a break from a rehearsal at the Cidade do Samba.
Austerity does not come naturally to carnival lovers, but attitudes are having to change now that Brazil's economic fortunes have turned upside down.
Until recently, it seemed the country could do no wrong. Thanks to a global commodity boom, strong demand from China and the discovery of huge offshore oil reserves, the economy surged forward at an annual average of 4.5% between 2002 and 2011.
Today, however, it seems nothing can go right. Prices of oil, iron ore and soya have plunged, China is slowing down and Brazil's policymakers are too absorbed in political battles and bribery investigations to focus effectively on the countermeasures. 
Decision making has been paralysed for much of the past year by a cascade of calamities: the country's biggest corruption scandal, its worst environmental disaster, and an impeachment battle against the president. 
Any one of them would rock a country in a normal year. Combined, they have crippled business and consumer confidence.
After shrinking by 3.71% last year, GDP is predicted to decline by a further 2.95% in 2015. The last time Brazil experienced such a deep slump was in 1901, when soldiers were still fighting the last Indian war and aviator Santos Dumont was making a name for himself by flying around the Eiffel Tower in a dirigible. 
Analysts are struggling to keep up with the speed of the deterioration. For 13 weeks in a row, the 100 or so private sector financial institutions surveyed in the the Central Bank's Boletin Focus survey have been forced to lower their forecasts for Brazil's economy. Yet reality continues to outstrip their pessimism.
The list of woes makes for spectacularly grim reading: as well as the deepest, this is forecast to be the most prolonged decline since the Great Depression of the 1930s. In December, consumer sentiment as measured by the Getulio Vargas Foundation in December reached a record low. The main stock index - Ibovespa - has fallen to a point not seen in six years and inflation is rising faster than at any time in 12 years, reaching 10.67% in 2015.
Foreign exchange markets have reflected the decline. In 2015, the real depreciated more than any other major currency, pushing up the price of imports.
The samba schools are feeling the consequences. "It's especially difficult because 60% of the materials we use come from abroad, and have their prices quoted in dollars," Schall of Mangueira complained.
Sponsorship is also harder to come by. Almost every major company is in retreat, as customers cut spending, investigators probe financial records and investors are scared away by ratings companies. More than 200 corporate downgrades last year have left most big firms either in junk territory or teetering on the brink.
The country's three largest revenue earners - which, until recently, were among the most valuable corporations in the world - have been knocked sideways.

Petrobras, which accounts for 10% of Brazil's fixed investment and 80,000 jobs, has been hammered by the fall in oil prices and the ongoing Lava Jato corruption investigation. Stuck with the unenviable title of the world's most indebted company, it has had to slash spending, which has had a dire impact on employment, as well as spending on cultural events like Carnival.
Vale, the world's biggest iron-ore producer, has not only suffered from plunging commodity prices, it was also hammered by the collapse of a tailings dam in November at one of its mines in Minas Gerais that discharged 50m cubic metres tons of toxic sludge into the River Doce. The accident, which was described as "Brazil's worst environmental disaster" by one cabinet minister, could cost the company and its partner - BHP Billiton - billions, not just for the clean-up and compensation, but to strengthen evidently inadequate safety standards.
Completing the calamitous trio is Odebrecht, the construction giant behind the Maracan„ World Cup stadium, Olympic venues and building projects across the globe. An employer of 140,000 people, it is one of the mainstays of the Brazilian economy, but its ability to do business has been hamstrung by allegations of corruption, the jailing of its chief executive, Marcelo Odebrecht, and a freeze on new contracts from Petrobras and the government.
The public purse is being tightened. Carnival organisers say they have yet to receive a single centavo from the local government despite promises of funding. "It's always the cultural budget that gets cut first," Schall says. More painfully, spending on healthcare and education have also been slashed. 
But the public deficit has continued to rise because tax revenues have fallen and higher interest rates have increased the government's borrowing costs. Congress could allow other austerity measures, but the two main political camps are half-hearted about what needs to be done. The ruling Workers party has reluctantly attempted to cut costs but doesn't have the stomach for it, while the centre-right opposition has put its ideologically budget-balancing instincts aside in order to make the government suffer. 
This has left Brazil floating in a limbo of no stimulus and no retrenchment. Unable to accept this drift, the finance minister, Joaquim Levy, resigned in December after failing to win support for his fiscal adjustment measures. 
This has further rattled the markets as his replacement Nelson Barbosa is less of a fiscal disciplinarian. In the expectation of a widening deficit, Fitch and Standard & Poor's have classified Brazil's sovereign debt as junk. Moody's is also considering a downgrade.
There is no immediate risk of a default. During the good years, Brazil paid off its debts and built up $370bn in foreign exchange reserves. This should prevent a repeat of the panic and hyperinflation of the 1980s and 1990s. The impact on the public has also been mollified by ring-fenced welfare benefits and levels of employment that are still relatively high - despite a near doubling of the jobless rate at one point last year. 
Adriano Pires, director of the Centro Brasileiro de Infra Estrutura, says the population has yet to feel the full impact of the current recession, but this will change over the next three months as taxes, school fees and Christmas debts come due. The entire economy faces a similar reckoning.
"Brazil is paying the price for the past. The bill is arriving," he says, concluding the economic problems cannot be resolved until the political crisis runs its course. 
Other analysts stress it is not enough to blame Brazil's woes on a loss of demand from Asia because other raw-material exporters, such as Indonesia, Chile and Peru have weathered the storm far better.
"Brazil probably did the worst job of any major commodity producing country in putting the boom to good use, and especially under Dilma its macro policies were simply atrocious," says Arthur Kroeber, managing director of GaveKal Dragonomics, who says Brazil needs to demolish its labyrinth of taxes and regulation and invest more in infrastructure and education. 
Nobody is predicting a recovery any time soon. 
"The outlook for 2016 is very bad", says Naercio Menezes Filho, an economics professor at the Insper business school. "In 2016, we will see the impact on jobs spread to the commerce and service sectors, where people are less qualified and poorer ... There will be a lot of private suffering."
For the moment that is not evident on the streets of Rio. Recent anti-government protests have mostly been middle class and diminishing in size. 
But there is a sense of gloom that will take some lifting. Carnival may help. Despite the modest budget trimming, organisers promise next month's spectacle at the SambÛdromo will be more vibrant than ever.
"The idea isn't to diminish carnival, but to carry out a great spectacle within the budget that will be even more dynamic," Schall says.
If the government and Congress could be as convincing about making more from less, Brazil could face the future with a lot more confidence. But that would require some unpopular decisions and for the moment nobody is willing to rain on the parade.
