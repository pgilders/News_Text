James Murdoch returns as Sky chairman; 
Rupert Murdoch's younger son stepped down from the pay-TV group in 2012 in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal.

James Murdoch is to return to Sky as chairman, almost four years after stood down in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal.
Murdoch, who was chief executive then chairman from 2003 until 2012, replaces Nick Ferguson, who stands down after 12 years. 
Murdoch, who is currently a Sky non-executive director, stepped down from the then BSkyB because of the fallout from his role as chairman of News International, publisher of the Sun, Times and now defunct News of the World.
At the time Murdoch said he felt it right to stand down as chairman of Sky - which is 39.1% owned by Rupert Murdoch's Fox- to avoid becom a "lightning rod" for the phone-hacking scandal.
"I would like to thank Nick for his outstanding contribution to the board over the last decade and more. I am proud to have been asked by the Board to serve as chairman of Sky, one of the world's leading pay TV companies," said Murdoch. 
"Jeremy and the team at Sky have done an outstanding job in building a dynamic and successful company. As chairman, I look forward to working with the Board and management as they continue to deliver a great service for Sky's customers and create value for all shareholders over the years to come." 
James Murdoch's handling of the phone-hacking scandal came under fire from MPs and others.
Broadcasting regulator Ofcom, which ruled Sky was a fit and proper broadcaster following an investigation prompted by the phone-hacking scandal, criticised Murdoch.
Ofcom said Murdoch's handling of the hacking scandal "fell short" of those expected of the a chief executive and chairman at News International at the time. 
James's return marks the latest stage of a remarkable reassertion of of power by Rupert Murdoch over his UK assets. 
In September, News Corp confirmed the return of Rebekah Brooks as chief executive of News UK, a year after she was cleared of all charges related to the phone-hacking scandal.

The Good Wife review: It has never made the pantheon of 'great TV' but it's top-quality drama; 
There's a tough current-affairs backbone to the trials of wronged woman, single mum and courtroom queen Alicia: no wonder she's into her seventh series.

Richard Vine.

T he Good Wife (More4) embraces change with all the enthusiasm of a January gym bunny, but also manages to sustain it like a seasoned marathon runner. Over the last seven years, we've watched Julianna Margulies navigate Alicia Florrick's ever changing moods: Saint Alicia, the wronged woman; Alicia the mother raising her kids on her own; Alicia the junior lawyer; the romantic having an office fling; the sharp legal brain running her own firm; the grieving lover drowning her heartbreak in buckets of white wine ... This is what long-form TV drama can do so well when it's in the hands of writers like Michelle and Robert King who really care about their characters (and about drama and, you know, just making entertaining TV). They convince us that there's real depth, that Alicia is a character with enough contradictions, emotional range and surprise to bring us back for more than 100 episodes.
Every season they keep it the same, but just different enough. Like a Brownian random motion experiment played out on a 3D pool table, they shuffle the characters around, moving them into position, then crashing them into each other from different angles; one minute they're in love, the next they're suing each other, or sitting on opposite sides of court. 
Underneath the soapier romances and shifting office politics, the case-of-the-week storylines provide a tough current affairs backbone; they've tackled bitcoin, Reddit, Anonymous, #BlackLivesMatter, the ethical dilemmas facing internet giants (they've even got their own Google-alike company, ChumHum) and the dark politics of scandals like Chicago's Homan Square black site detention centre.
If you're a fan, you'll relish the options floated in this opening episode of the seventh season. There's Louis Canning (a brilliant ongoing supporting role from Michael J Fox) returning to seduce Alicia to the dark side of the law and get her to join his lone-shark firm. After her own botched political career, Alicia decides to stop butting heads with estranged husband Peter (Chris Noth, aka Sex and the City's Mr Big) and agrees to back his bid for vice-president. Keeping things topical, he's hoping to be Hillary's running mate - a vote of confidence in the Clinton campaign if ever there was one.
Eli Gold (Alan Cumming) jumps at the chance to up the game for Peter's campaign: they need to bring national election strategist Ruth Eastman (Margo Martindale) on board. She's a national expert, after all. Which she proves with her first executive decision: firing Eli. It's the first salvo in a war that feels like it's got a long way to run. Eli storms off vowing revenge; the pairing of Cumming (the scenery chomper's scenery chomper) and Martindale (so good in The Americans) feels like a fight to relish.
There's also the chance to see Alicia squaring off against former partners Diane Lockhart and Cary Agos in a typically goofy Good Wife inheritance case that hinges on some misplaced Post-it notes. It's a Good Wife tradition to cast the judges from some of the greats of classic US TV; over the years we've had cameos from Transparent's Jeffrey Tambor, Bebe Neuwirth from Cheers, Seinfeld's Jerry Stiller, Taxi's Judd Hirsch and Dominic Chianese from The Sopranos; this week's case is played out under the auspices of Judge Jane Curtin - a bonus for Kate & Allie fans.
And after all that business last time with Alicia's election scandal (she ran for state's attorney against Niles from Frasier, then stood down after news of her affair with Will was leaked) she's been booted down the legal ladder. Instead of the exposed brick chic of the Florrick-Agos offices, she's now diving into the wham-bam, thank you Uncle Sam world of the bail bonds court, in front of a judge whose only concern seems to be getting home on time. At first, Alicia is frozen out - the judge knows who she is and doesn't want anything to do with her - but after a few comedy moments, another overworked lawyer persuades him to let Alicia pick up some of the slack.
Which solves two things: first, a whole new sector of the American legal system is opened up to the forensic Florrick brain (basically, she's defending people who would never be able to afford her). And second, she gets a new drinking buddy to hang out with in that bar she likes. Now that Archie Panjabi has taken Kalinda's boots and left the building, here's hoping that Lucca Quinn will prove to be as much fun. Or at least, will stick around for a glass of Chardonnay or three.
Like Scandal or Damages, The Good Wife has never quite entered the pantheon of "great TV" alongside Mad Men and Breaking Bad. Maybe it's too soapy or too broad, or not sweary or "dark" enough; but it's a quality proposition, as good as mainstream US network drama gets. Margulies hinted in a tweet last week that she would be "unemployed" in April; if this really is the last time we get to see The Good Wife characters bouncing off each other, it's been a great ride.

Celebrity chef urges MPs to support food waste bill; 
Kerry McCarthy takes her food waste (reduction) bill for its second reading in the House of Commons.

Frances Perraudin.

Celebrity chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall has urged MPs to support a Labour bill designed to reduce supermarket food waste.
Labour's shadow secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs, Kerry McCarthy, will on Friday take her food waste (reduction) bill for its second reading in the House of Commons. 
"The supermarkets need to step up and massively reduce the waste they cause in the food supply chain and that's exactly what the food waste (reduction) bill calls on them to do," said Fearnley-Whittingstall.
"They need to adhere to the principle that food that is fit to be eaten by people, should be eaten by people. It's ridiculous that so much good food is going into anaerobic digestion, rather than being redistributed to people in need." 
                     A report from the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, published this week, showed that the UK was throwing away 15m tonnes of food a year. Only 2% of our surplus food waste is currently redistributed to charities.
McCarthy, MP for Bristol East, said voluntary action by the food industry was failing to reduce food waste and that legislation was essential. "My bill commits us to the UN goal of halving food waste by 2030, setting out a clear path for reducing food waste and ensuring perfectly good surplus food is donated to charities," she said.
Fearnley-Whittingstall said that supermarkets needed to be transparent about how much food they were wasting "from farm, to production, through to retail" and come up with coherent, credible plan for reducing that waste. "I welcome this bill, and hope MPs get behind it, so we can put to an end the scandal of food being wasted on a huge scale," he said.
This bill has cross-party support and its named supporters include Conservative London mayoral candidate Zac Goldsmith, the Green party's only MP, Caroline Lucas, chairman of the work and pensions select committee, Frank Field, and shadow chief secretary to the treasury, Seema Malhotra.
                     In August, the United Nations claimed that if the amount of food wasted around the world were reduced by just 25% there would be enough food to feed all the people who are malnourished.
The organisation said that 1.3bn tonnes of food, about a third of all that is produced, is wasted each year, including about 45% of all fruit and vegetables, 35% of fish and seafood, 30% of cereals, 20% of dairy products and 20% of meat. Meanwhile, 795 million people suffer from severe hunger and malnutrition.

Major airlines suspend Vanuatu flights over airport runway concerns; 
A deteriorating runway has lead to Qantas, Air New Zealand and Virgin Australia suspending flights to Vanuatu capital Port Vila.

Helen Davidson.

Vanuatu's tourism industry is again under threat after three major airlines suspended flights to the archipelago because of the capital's deteriorating runway.
Over the past week Qantas, Air New Zealand and Virgin Australia have suspended flights and code shares to Port Vila over concerns of the condition of the Bauerfield International Airport strip.
Virgin Australia said it would have one flight on Saturday for passengers returning to their port of origin. 
A number of Pacific airlines are continuing to fly, including Air Vanuatu, which said it was meeting daily with Civil Aviation Authority Vanuatu and airport management. All flights are continuing to Espiritu Santo - another island in the archipelago.
Safety measures in Port Vila, including daily sweeping of the runway, were being monitored and captains had the final say on whether it was up to scratch before taking off, it said. 
The damaged airstrip - it is said to be crumbling - is not due to cyclone damage, but rather degradation over time and government delays in upgrading. The government is yet to act on a US$59.5m agreement with the World Bank to fund the upgrade of the Port Vila and two other airstrips.
The flight cancellations are another setback for the country, which was devastated by the powerful category-five cyclone Pam last year.
Tourism generally accounts for about 40% of Vanuatu's GDP and about a third of its permanent workforce, but faced a significant downturn following the destructive cyclone. 
The International Monetary Fund forecast an economic decline of about 2% for 2015 following the cyclone, due to its impact on tourism and agriculture, in contrast to the 3.5% growth predicted before the storm.
Much of the country's population rely on subsistence farming of coconut and kava, but after cyclone Pam it will take up to 10 years for these crops to recover.
Despite the poor outlook, tourist numbers were increasing at the end of last year, said chair of the Vanuatu Hotels and Resorts Association, Bryan Death.
"In the latter part of 2015 they were pretty much back to where they were the previous year, and that was an encouraging sign, but that's now on hold," Death told the Guardian.
"[Hotel cancellations] are of great concern to our operators here because our bookings were starting to pick up."
Death said the government and national bank of Vanuatu were in discussions over a zero-interest loan to conduct emergency repairs to the runway, estimated to cost US$1m, which would allow for flights to resume in six to eight weeks.
"One of the things we're trying to say to people is if you have bookings coming into Vanuatu in our high season and [the] period after easter onwards, don't necessarily go and cancel plans straight away."
Vanuatu's political instability has also contributed to the current crisis. A national election, called after a corruption scandal engulfed the government and saw 14 MPs, including a former prime minister, jailed, was held last week.

Death said there was nowhere else to apportion blame for the runway than with the government. 
"If the politicians had done their job last year, the runway would have been upgraded and completed last year," he said.
"There was a funding approval in March last year that sat on the table until the government decided very recently they were going to cancel the World Bank agreement and go to an Asian offer ... Now the crisis has happened the government has done a full backflip and are supporting the World Bank agreement."
The World Bank's Pacific Islands director, Franz Drees-Gross, told the Guardian the US$59.5m funding project was still available.
"What we have is a project, fully prepared with our technical team and counterparts in Vanuatu," he said, adding that it was approved by the World Bank board in May 2015, and signed by the Vanuatu government the following month. 
Later that year Drees-Gross heard informally the Vanuatu government was seeking a different single-source loan, but he was never told anything directly. He questioned why the Vanuatu government would seek a different funding sources as the financial terms of the World Bank loan were "much cheaper than anything you could get anywhere else."
"The money is as approved now as it's always been since May of last year," said Drees-Gross.
For Vanuatu to access the funds they must go through a design and tender process approved by the World Bank. 
The funds included US$3.8m for emergency repairs - such as those required now.

Friday Focus: familiar promises at Perth Glory after disappointment and betrayal; 
In January 2015 Perth Glory were riding high yet 12 months on, one recent result aside, things could not be more different and the future in the west is uncertain.

Joe Gorman.

What a difference a week makes. Last Sunday, the bottom of the table clash between Perth Glory and Newcastle Jets ended in a 6-1 win to Glory. Although the gap between the top six and the rest remains significant, Glory CEO Peter Filopolous believes finals football is within reach. He's also convinced the club will crack the 10,000 crowd mark for the first time this season at nib Stadium on Saturday. 
 Related:  Perth Glory hit 10-man Newcastle Jets for six in A-League romp 
 Filopolous says it has been a season for "consolidation", but if history is your thing - and for most Glory fans it is - then the club appears to have gone backwards. This time last year Glory were top of the A-League ladder, W-League premiers and second-placed in the National Youth League. This weekend, Glory host Melbourne Victory having won just four games all season. Crowds are at their lowest in the club's 20 year history, the W-League team finished second last, and the NYL side won just two games to finish bottom of their conference.
 Certainly this season was never going to be easy. The exodus that coach Kenny Lowe feared in April came to fruition, with players such as Scott Jamieson, Danny Vukovic, Jamie Maclaren, Brandon O'Neill, Mitch Nichols, Riley Woodcock, Michael Thwaite, Antony Golec and Youssef Hersi all departing, while Andy Keogh has only recently returned after a stint in Thailand. The next four rounds don't do them any favours: Glory face top five sides Melbourne Victory, Sydney FC, Brisbane Roar and Western Sydney Wanderers, while a long trip to Wellington awaits next weekend.
 Take a longer view, however, and the situation appears worse. Between 1996 and 2004 in the old national league, Glory won the premiership three times, the championship twice, and most importantly, revolutionised the way football was organised in Australia. Glory were once the most powerful example of a privately-owned franchise that represented an entire city rather than a community.
 Twenty years ago, almost to the day, Fairfax journalist Michael Cockerill wrote of Glory: "This all-Australian success story has happened not by accident but by design. Which means the formula can be applied elsewhere to strengthen and develop the national league."
 Filopolous remembers those days well. In 1996 he was CEO of South Melbourne. "I've always had a close affinity with the brand of Perth Glory, from the days it emerged so spectacularly back in 1996," he says. Filopolous, who was appointed in June 2015 after Jason Brewer resigned in the fallout from last season's salary cap scandal, holds a positive outlook for Glory. In February, the club will release its four year plan, titled The Perth Glory Way. 
 Related:  Michael Thwaite joins Perth Glory exodus with move to China
 Just what is the Perth Glory way? Under the ownership of Tony Sage it has been tricky to pin down. There has been an enormous amount of passion, tears following the 2012 grand final loss, and plenty of off-field drama. 
 While Sage is in charge Glory may never again reach the heady days of the late 1990s, when the club was the pride of Western Australia. Outside the circle of people directly employed by him, there is a level of dissatisfaction towards Sage in the west and fans have protested against his ownership. And, of course, it was under his reign that the club was found guilty of cheating the competition rules. FFA chief executive David Gallop labelled Sage's lack of knowledge of the salary cap situation "obviously unacceptable". Sage has denied any knowledge of the salary cap issues that saw the FFA expel the Glory from the A-League finals in 2015.
 Many believe this is why crowds are at an all-time low. Glory fans have never had it better since the upgrade of nib Stadium, yet the interest doesn't seem to be there. This season, after eight home games, the average gate is just 7,160.
 "We have moved forward [from the salary cap scandal]," says Filopolous. "We've drawn a line in the sand and moved forward as a club. There's some fans that still feel aggrieved, and obviously a small element that we need to re-engage, but we've moved forward."
 Part of moving forward was taking over the licence of the W-League side, which for several seasons was run and funded by Football West. After last season's success, however, 2015-16 has been difficult. It took several weeks for the players to even get their kits for the new season; in one home match the club ran out of water during a game, with coaching staff having to run out with cups of tap water for the players. After every away game, the squad has had to shower, change and get to the airport for a red-eye flight back to Perth. When Glory played a double-header against Brisbane Roar in November, the W-League side flew home the same night. The A-League players, of course, flew home the next morning. Perhaps it is unsurprising that there were so many injuries this season. When asked about these issues, Filopolous offered no comment except to say there had been some "teething issues" in the transition.
 Times are tight over in the west, and the club is not making money. Sage, who is invested heavily in a faltering mining industry, has seen the share price in his company Cape Lambert fall. Word is that Perth Glory were put on the market in the off-season, but couldn't attract a buyer. Glory's founding owner Nick Tana is understood to be interested.
 The recent promises emanating from the the club are encouraging, although familiar. Perhaps the record-breaking victory last weekend will entice a few fans back. After so much disappointment and betrayal, let's hope its not too late. A strong national league requires a strong Perth Glory.

Where will The Good Wife's rollercoaster plotlines head next?; 
The seventh season of the legal drama begins this week - and it could be the last. So what happened to Alicia Florrick last time round, and where might she end up?.

Sammy Maine.

                     This blog features spoilers for seasons two and six of The Good Wife.                   
The Good Wife creators Michelle and Robert King love to put Alicia Florrick (Julianna Margulies) through the wringer. We're used to seeing her shining in triumph, then an episode later sipping from a salad bowl of red wine after yet another scandal; the Kings don't allow monumental highs without devastating lows. So with the seventh - and potentially final - season beginning tonight in the UK, where is Florrick's head currently at?
 Related:  Julianna Margulies on Alicia Florrick: 'She doesn't give a damn any more' 
We began last season with Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski) merging with the Florrick/Agos firm, which we welcomed, given their combined knack for scathing putdowns. Alicia is initially unsure whether to run for state attorney but, with Eli Gold (Alan Cumming) able to slip into melodramatic campaign-pusher mode, it's not long before she decides to go for it - with a little help from a poignant Gloria Steinem guest appearance. 
Meanwhile, Alicia's business partner Cary Agos (Matt Czuchry) finds himself in a spot of bother after a crew member of drug lord Lemond Bishop (Mike Colter) records him seemingly giving legal advice on moving a whole lot of heroin. His bail money is finally found through a $4m case win for their old pals ChumHum.
Archie Panjabi's Kalinda goes back to what she does best: sassy backchat, top-notch investigative triumphs and selective sleeping around. As Cary yearns for more than just a late-night booty call, Kalinda is back with Federal Agent Lana Delaney (Jill Flint), who in turn is also investigating Lemond Bishop. Forging some information on evidence for Cary's case, Kalinda is forced to go on the run, leading to her eventual departure from the show.
Alicia gains her state attorney opponent in the form of news anchor Frank Prady (David Hyde Pierce) - and, in a fist-in-the-air moment, beats him. But of course she doesn't get an easy ride. Her son Zach gets his underage girlfriend an abortion; Peter once again cheats on her, this time with her old friend Ramona Lytton, played by Connie Nielson. An email hack meanwhile releases proof of her season two affair with Will Gardner. Accused of hacking the voting machines, she is given the help of Spencer Randolph (Ron Rifkin), a civil rights lawyer she has long admired... and he screws her over, forcing her to step down as state attorney. It's a little insulting, then, when Peter announces he'll be running for the US presidency.

Having been forced out by her firm (now Lockhart/Agos/Lee) after her state's attorney appointment and later scandal, she has nowhere left to turn but her kinda-flame, Finn Polmar (Matthew Goode). The sexual tension frustratingly resists rearing its head, but we do witness some light hand-holding and forlorn looks in expensive bars. 
She asks him to set up a firm with her (yes, another) but Finn decides the tension is all too much for any sort of professional relationship. Luckily, there's a knock on the door from Michael J Fox's Louis Canning: "Wanna partner?" Given Alicia and Louis' courtroom duels, their partnership could be a highlight of the new season. 
 Related:  The Good Wife will mirror the real-life presidential race in new season
The Good Wife gets its edge from mirroring current affairs - and with Peter pitted up against Hilary for the race to the White House, the show's reactivity will truly be tested. It also bags piquant guest appearances - as well as Fox, I'd welcome back Carrie Preston's Elsbeth Tascioni, along with Dylan Baker's devilish Colin Sweeney. With Kalinda gone meanwhile, it could mean a return for Jess Weixler's Robyn Burdine.
Rumoured to be the last we see of The Good Wife, season seven gives its creators the chance to bring some solace to their heroine before they leave the show - of course, not without the trials and tribulations she's so good at getting through. But as close as fans have grown to Alicia over these past six seasons, the emotional rollercoasters - while almost replacing your weekly cardio with their assault on your heartrate - are a little tiresome for those of us rooting for her success. The Kings love to sucker-punch plot advancements, such as the state attorney story, which almost makes it feel as though we've wasted our investment in those next steps. 
When Alicia is happy, she snogs her campaign manager and has tender moments with her daughter Grace;  by exploring this side of her, the writers can make more time for her all-too-infrequent sassiness. Confident, fiery Alicia is the best kind to watch - a more human Alicia. Not only does she deserve a happy ending, but with so many setbacks these past few seasons, her viewers deserve one too.

Seven ages of Hillary Clinton: a woman who in her time has played many parts; 
As she once again finds herself battling an outsider's insurgency, the Democratic frontrunner hopes her long experience in public life is an asset, not a liability.

Gary Younge in Adel, Iowa.

                     At a town hall meeting this week, the first question posed to Hillary Clinton was from a first-time caucus-goer called Taylor Gipple. 
 Related:  Hillary Clinton defends popularity among young voters at Iowa forum
"It feels like there are a lot of young people like myself who are very passionate supporters of Bernie Sanders," he said. "And, I just don't see the same enthusiasm from younger people for you. In fact, I've heard from quite a few people my age that they think you're dishonest, but I'd like to hear from you on why you feel the enthusiasm isn't there." 
Clinton's response sounded like a mix of Edith Piaf and Sir Elton John: Je Ne Regrette Rien blended with I'm Still Standing; stern resolve with a touch of telegraphed theatricality. "Look, I've been around a long time," she told him. "They throw all this stuff at me and I'm still standing. But if you're new to politics, if it's the first time you really paid attention, you go 'oh my gosh, look at all of this'. And you have to say to yourself, 'why are they throwing all of that'? Well, I'll tell you why. Because I've been on the frontlines of change and progress since I was your age."
Not for the first time, Clinton finds herself in an existential battle with a rank outsider - Bernie Sanders cast in the role of Barack Obama - which threatens to derail her anticipated processional journey to the White House. Her experience and ever-presence on the public stage seem to be equal parts hindrance and help.
  In the generation since Hillary Clinton first entered the public gaze, attitudes to women, feminism, politics, marriage and the presidency have undergone fundamental shifts. Her challenge, as a presidential candidate, is to tell a personal story and embrace a political platform that are both true to her past and chime with the electoral mood of the present. That, in turn, demands that she reminds some - particularly the young - of what she has done and been while hoping that others - particularly those who are older or on the left - forget much of what she has said and done.
A new ad showcasing various clips of her throughout her career speaking about the rights of children - panning through the range of hairstyles and speaking styles of her adult life, from bookish to bullish - intends to leave the viewer with a sense of her longevity and consistency as a campaigner. Truly, it sets forth the Seven Ages of Hillary, and ends with the line: "I'm Hillary Clinton and I have a lways  approved this message."
"What I love most about America," the late Susan Sontag once told me, is that, "you're allowed to change your life, to reinvent yourself." There have been several versions of Hillary Clinton. Her success will depend in no small part on which one people think they're voting for.
It is easy to forget what a mould-breaking, badass figure Hillary cut when she first appeared on the national stage in 1992. Neither the media nor the political establishment knew quite what to do with her. "Meet the new political wife," said Ted Koppel as he introduced her on Nightline in 1992. "She has a career, she has opinions. A partner in every way ... Never in a presidential campaign has the candidate's wife become such a strong symbol of the campaign's strength and weakness." 
She courted controversy simply by existing, working and thinking. She was a late-20th-century woman, in a modern, troubled marriage, being publicly interviewed for an 18th-century job as first lady - a job only available through the achievements of her serially philandering husband. The contradictions were manifest and multiple; the couple's ambitions were insatiable and undeniable.
The appeal, for some, was enduring. "When Bill was running for president, I knew she was something special," said 76-year-old Norma McCuen, who saw Hillary speak at a bowling alley in the small town of Adel, Iowa, (population 4,047) earlier this week. "I liked him, but I was hoping that one day she would run. She stands up for women. I know she had to work hard herself, and I think she wants women to have the same opportunities as men and to stand alongside them shoulder-to-shoulder." 
The mould had been set by a patriarchal political culture in which women could rarely be viable candidates themselves and as candidates' wives were supposed to be essentially decorative and supporting, not independent and engaging. 
 Related:  Hillary Clinton's seven ages - in pictures
It was broken by second-wave feminism of which Hillary Clinton was both a clear beneficiary and moderate advocate, riding the wave to both academic success and professional accomplishment. She was a valedictorian at the Wellesley women's college the same year as Woodstock and graduated from Yale law school, which was 90% male, the same year the landmark abortion ruling Roe v Wade was passed. In 1979, a year after her husband became governor of Arkansas and a year before her daughter Chelsea was born, she became the first female lawyer at the Rose Law firm in Arkansas. Throughout this time she kept her maiden name: Hillary Rodham.
"I had watched her when she was the first lady of Arkansas," the late Maya Angelou told me, explaining why she backed Clinton over Obama in 2008. "I thought this white girl would come to Arkansas and play croquet on the lawn and throw tea parties. And she was just the opposite. She worked on public health and education ... even prisons. When her husband ran for the presidency and she said she was not going to bake cookies, I thought, 'I'm going to watch her for a while.'"
Almost everybody had a view about her and few of those views were moderate. Feminist author Susan Faludi described her at the time as a symbol of "the joy of female independence". The American Spectator branded her the "Lady Macbeth of Arkansas". Asked to pick out words that best described her years later, members of the public chose "intelligent" and "smart". The third word, pollsters at the Pew Research Center said, is a pejorative term that "rhymes with rich".
When Bill failed to be re-elected as Arkansas governor in 1980, Hillary was told that it was in part because she didn't take his second name. Ever aware of the need to be strategic in pursuit of power, she changed it to Hillary Rodham Clinton. He won re-election in 1982.
As the presidential campaign continued in 1992 she actually entered a bake-off against other candidates' wives in Family Circle with a recipe for chocolate chip. (She won.) By the time she stood for president in her own right for the first time 16 years later she went by Hillary Clinton and she baked cookies.
Today, she's just Hillary, no second name necessary. Earlier this week, before a hundred or so supporters in Adel she delivered her stump speech, focusing her fire on the Republicans. "We live in reality, they live in ideology," she says. 
She's a more fluent orator than her chief opponent, Bernie Sanders, and has a far less abrasive style. But while Sanders unfurls a vision, on huge canvas in broad strokes, of the kind of society he would like to see - free healthcare, no state tuition, $15 minimum wage - Hillary paints by numbers. Better rates of interest for student loans; an infrastructure bank; building on Obamacare. All of it possible; none of it exciting. 
"When Democrats are in power the economy improves," she says citing her husband's tenure. "We lifted people out of poverty," and "We created jobs." 
It is problematic to judge a woman by her husband's deeds. In Hillary's case it is also impossible not to because she weaves herself so seamlessly into Bill Clinton's story. Being first lady is part of her "experience". "It was Hillarycare before it was Obamacare," she reminds the crowd, referring to the time she was appointed by her husband to head up healthcare reform and failed.
Before she ran in 2008, the New Yorker's Judith Thurman wrote: "It's not that Mrs Clinton hasn't paid her dues. But rather that she hasn't paid most of them from her own account. Her official credit history in national politics starts in 2000 [when she was elected to the Senate]." 
Bill is not simply her spouse but her most loyal and fiercest advocate and a former president. The chairman of her campaign, John Podesta, was his chief of staff. For two years she sat on the board of what is now the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation - the multimillion-dollar global philanthropic venture he set up.
 But if she is to align herself with the economic successes of those years then she must also claim ownership of less attractive elements of its legacy. While her husband was president the rate of black incarceration grew exponentially, key elements of financial regulation were repealed, paving the way for the economic crash, welfare reform was passed, removing essential support from the most vulnerable (of whom women of colour were over-represented) and the Defence of Marriage Act was signed, defining marriage exclusively as the union of one man and one woman for the purposes of federal law. 
It is true that millions emerged from poverty and incomes grew: it is also true that economic inequality skyrocketed. Given the emergence of the Black Lives Matter movement, Occupy Wall Street and marriage equality, these are all liabilities for those asking: "How did we get here and whom should we hire to get us out"?
Finally there are the revived claims of her husband's sexual harassment and infidelities and the accusation - unsubstantiated but no less accusatory - that she was complicit in either denigrating the victims or slut-shaming his mistresses. Those who lived through the drama of the Monica Lewinsky scandal - the witch-hunting by the special prosecutor, Kenneth Starr, the hounding of the intern Lewinsky, the barefaced lies of the president, the lurid details of the report - will in part draw their conclusions about her loyalty, credibility and humanity through the prism of that moment.
In an episode of The Sopranos, Carmela Soprano and three friends are lamenting their men's unfaithful ways over lunch when the conversation leads to Hillary Clinton.
"I can't stand that woman," says one.
"I don't know. Maybe we could all take a page from her book," responds the second.
"What, to be humiliated in public, and then walk around smiling all the time? That is so false," argues Carmela.
"All I know is she stuck by him and put up with the shit and in the end, what did she do? She set up her own little thing," says the second.
"She took all that negative shit he gave her, and spun it into gold. You got to give her credit," says another.
"She is a role model for all of us," concludes Carmela.
Today her "own little thing" amounts to an impressive record in its own right. She was elected to the Senate from New York in 2000, ran for president in 2008 and was secretary of state for four years. For a significant portion of the electorate under the age of 35, this is the only Hillary they really know. 
But thanks to strides in women's representation her presence in those roles no longer feels groundbreaking in a way it would have done when she first appeared on the scene. The first female secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, was appointed by Bill Clinton, and there has been another (Condoleezza Rice) since. There were four female senators when Bill was elected president; by the time Hillary went to the Senate there were three times as many.
And her experience cuts both ways. It's true that she was in the situation room when Osama bin Laden was executed; it's also true that she was one of the Democratic senators who voted for the Iraq war.
The depiction of her as an establishment candidate is a paradox, she argues, given that Sanders was elected to Congress two years before she became first lady. But throughout that time Sanders has been railing against entrenched interests as an "idealist" while she has been horse-trading with them as a "pragmatist". Those who have followed her for the past 25 years might see the Benghazi hearings and furore over her email account as more smears by the right. But as she pointed out to the young questioner at the town hall meeting, those not familiar with her past may well see her as damaged goods - a scandal magnet to which something will inevitably stick.
"I don't like Hillary," said Karen Sanchez, a 19-year-old Sanders supporter from Marshalltown, Iowa, who attended a Trump rally for the pure spectacle of it. She has no memory of Clinton facing down patronising media questions with chutzpah - "You know, I'm not sitting here like some little woman standing by my man, like Tammy Wynette. I'm sitting here because I love him, and I respect him, and I honour what he's been through and what we've been through together. And you know, if that's not enough for people, then heck, don't vote for him." Karen, a first-time voter, barely even remembers her stint as secretary of state. But she knows Clinton is being investigated and believes she promises little in the way of change. 
"I think she should be in prison for all the embezzlement that she did and the emails that she sent. Setting that aside I just don't think she would do much. I would love to see a woman president. But not her."

San Francisco police pledge calls on officers to report intolerant colleagues; 
Law enforcement asked to promise not to 'tolerate hate or bigotry' amid scrutiny after shooting of black man and emergence of racist texts.

Associated Press.

San Francisco police officers are being asked to combat racism in the ranks and take a pledge to turn in colleagues displaying intolerant behavior, such as slurs and jokes targeting people of color, gay people and women.
The pledge is part of a broader public relations campaign by the embattled police department to repair frayed relations with minority neighborhoods and community activists.
The campaign comes amid growing tensions between police and black communities that are shaking up departments across the country and have led to the dismissal of top brass in some cities, including Chicago. Politically progressive San Francisco is not immune from the unrest. The 2 December shooting of a young black man clutching a kitchen knife by five officers has increased racial tensions and sparked calls for the police chief's removal.  
So far, San Francisco's mayor has stood behind the chief amid the emergence of racist text messages exchanged among several officers and a judge's decision that he failed to punish the officers in timely fashion. 
Police say Mario Woods, 26, had stabbed a stranger earlier that day, ignored commands to drop the knife and shook off blasts of tear gas and shots from a bean bag gun before officers opened fire.
Police say only one of the five officers involved was white, but protests over the shooting have persisted. Mayor Ed Lee has asked the Justice Department to investigate. 
Chief Greg Suhr said the pledge and the "Not on My Watch" campaign had been in the works long before the Woods shooting, but the incident gave the project new urgency. Several angry protests were organized in the rough neighborhood where Woods died. And people demanding the chief's dismissal disrupted the mayor's inauguration on 8 January and briefly shut down the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge on Martin Luther King Jr Day on 18 January.
Yulanda Williams, who leads a minority police officers' group, helped initiate the pledge after she found that a white colleague used an anti-black slur in text messages to other officers complaining about her promotion to sergeant. Other text messages exchanged among Williams' colleagues contained racist and homophobic insults and slurs.

"I will not tolerate hate or bigotry in our community or from my fellow officers," the seven-sentence pledge states in part. "I will confront intolerance and report any such conduct without question or pause." 
The department has also launched a website, NotOnMyWatchSFPD.org, which instructs citizens and officers on how to file complaints against the police. The website includes a 10-minute video produced by a former television journalist, showing the chief, several officers and civic leaders reciting and discussing the pledge and the importance of rooting out intolerance in the ranks. 
Law enforcement experts say San Francisco's pledge is a novel way to try and tamp down rising tensions. 
"I think it sends a good signal," said University of South Carolina School of Law professor Seth Soughton, a former police officer and law enforcement scholar. "But whether or not the signal is strong enough remains to be seen." 
The Reverend Amos Brown, head of the local NAACP chapter, supports the pledge and called it a "step in the right direction".
The police officers' union has endorsed the pledge, though San Francisco Police Officers Association president Martin Halloran says reciting it is voluntary. 
The police chief hopes every officer will recite the voluntary pledge every January to help instill a culture of tolerance and accountability. Police cadets read the pledge 15 January at their graduation.

"I really think it's important that the public hear us say the words," Suhr said. 
The pledge is one of several changes Suhr has made in the department since the racist text messages emerged from a police corruption case. Suhr has been trying to fire eight officers implicated in the scandal, but a judge recently ruled that he waited too long to discipline them after discovering the texts two years ago. Suhr is appealing the decision. 
Suhr reintroduced a proposal to equip officers with stun guns to help deal with confrontations like the Woods shooting and has announced a number of other "use-of-force" policy changes. 
Officers must now report whenever they point their guns at suspects. Firearms training has been changed to emphasize other "less-than-lethal" options. And the department is developing ways to deal with knife-wielding suspects. 
The pledge is not asking officers to "snitch" on one another, Suhr said. Rather, he said, it is intended to reinforce that the police department reflects the tolerant and diverse culture of San Francisco. 
"It's what we swore to do," Suhr said. "People that would use racial epithets, slurs and things like that clearly fall below the minimum standard of being a police officer. A cop needs to show character and point that out."

Sport may need its own Untouchables to root out the bad guys; 
Better oversight and more funding are essential, and the police need to get more involved, but perhaps world sport needs its own team of investigators.

Sean Ingle.

Remember that scene from The Untouchables when Sean Connery tells Kevin Costner's Eliot Ness how to bring down the bad guys? "You wanna know how to get Capone?" he asks. "They pull a knife, you pull a gun. He sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue, that's how you get Capone. Now do you want to do that? Are you ready to do that?" Connery's Irish-by-way-of-Edinburgh accent was voted the worst in Hollywood history but the sentiment was clear enough. Serious problems need serious tools and intentions to fix them.
And so to another week of corruption in sport - including allegations of brown envelopes in athletics, more back-and-forth rallies over match-fixing in tennis and the extraordinary case of a Belgian cyclist having her bike detained at a world cyclo-cross race owing to suspicions of "mechanical doping". The days when drugs were sport's only bogeyman now seem quaint. 
                     Simon Barnes, writing in this week's Spectator, claims sport is in trouble as never before because of an erosion of faith he likens to Catholicism losing half its followers in the 16th century. I'm not so sure. The Fifa scandal has hardly punctured football's popularity but the unholy nexus of match-fixing, doping and administrators who are either bent or wilfully blind has thrown the issue of how to protect sport back on the agenda.
But this is a tricky issue to solve, even assuming that all sports are hellbent on doing so in the first place. Speak to a dozen people and they will have a dozen different plans. Broadly, though, there is agreement that something needs to be done. And, more vaguely, that the 'something' requires better leadership from - and greater scrutiny of - sporting bodies as well as a deeper understanding of the complicated and often interlinked issues around governance, anti-doping and match-fixing. Oh, and money. Lots more money.
However, the sports lawyer and chief executive of the London Marathon, Nick Bitel, is blunt. "We have poor governance throughout international sport because no one holds these bodies to account," he warns. "You might be able to show me one or two that are well run but it's not very often."
Bitel, who upset many in the IAAF last summer when he said athletics was not doing enough to catch cheats, has a solution: the establishment of international governance rules along the lines of the World Anti-Doping Agency code. This would be backed by an international charter like that that underpins Wada making it something that can bind governments.
Such a solution could ensure, for instance, that the Tennis Integrity Unit was better funded and truly independent. As things stand, its board comprises the chairman of the All England Tennis Club, the chair and CEO of the WTA, the president of the ITF and the executive chairman and president of the ATP. How can that not represent a major conflict of interest?
Richard Ings, whose roles as a former ATP executive and head of the Australian Anti-Doping Agency give him more perspective than most, believes sport is not equipped to fight cheats on its own. He argues that the US Anti-Doping Agency under Travis Tygaart, and the UK Anti-Doping Agency, should expand their remit to take on match-fixing. Ings's logic is enticing. As he points out, doping and match-fixing are two sides of the same coin - cheating. But one involves sticking a syringe in an exposed buttock or arm, the other a well-greased palm. The solutions are similar too: greater intelligence, investigative powers and better relationships with law enforcement.
However, we should be careful not to conflate the governance and doping issues with the fixing one. Ings, for one, warns: "We are asking too much of sport when it comes to match-fixing. It's very unfair. An organisation such as the ATP can't get into issues of crime. These are police matters. You need proper integrity units."
Ings would like to see a global law enforcement focus to reduce illegal gambling, because the more gambling goes through licensed bookies the more transparency on who is betting. But in his view the police would still be the ones chasing after the criminals not sport.
Match-fixing is way down the list of priorities for law enforcement, which is why you hear advocates for sport to have its own untouchables - a team of global investigators who can sniff out and tackle corruption in all its forms. A global solution, to use politician-speak, for a global problem.
Yet not everyone is convinced. A sporting integrity officer I spoke to warned that even getting sports federations to be aware of the issues they face is a challenge, let alone funding programmes to combat them. He was sceptical, to put it mildly, that such federations would fund a global sports police body.
This is not a sexy subject. We come to sport for action, after all, not administration. But it is unlikely to go away. A report by the Danish Institute of Sports Studies ranked Fifa second out of 35 federations belonging to the Olympic family based on how transparent, democratic and accountable they were. If Fifa is a standard-bearer in this area what does this make everyone else?
One final point. Wada was founded in 1999 following widespread problems in athletics and the Festina affair in cycling. What will be the tipping point for a similar body to be established to tackle match-fixing and corruption in sport?

But this is not easy to solve. For a start, governance, doping and fixing issues - while overlapping - can require different solutions. Sometimes they also need action at national, international and by the sport itself, and most bodies are not built to spring into action. Then there is the vexed question of who stumps up the money to tackle the cheats and crooks.
However, the sports lawyer and chief executive of the London Marathon, Nick Bitel, is blunt. "We have poor governance throughout international sport because no one holds these bodies to account," he warns. "You might be able to show me one or two that are well run but it's not very often."

Labor pledges to crack down on employers who exploit workers; 
Penalties would be increased to $200,000 for individuals and more than $1m for corporations, and a new criminal offence introduced.

Gabrielle Chan.

Labor has promised to crack down on the exploitation of workers by significantly increasing penalties for employers who underpay workers to more than $200,000 for individuals and more than $1m for corporations. 
 A Labor government would also tighten legal protections for workers exploited in so-called "sham" contracts, where employers hire workers as subcontractors to avoid entitlements such as annual leave and sick leave.
 Related:  Two 7-Eleven franchise agreements cut over underpaid workers
Labor promised to give the fair work ombudsman more power to chase down employers who liquidate companies to avoid worker entitlements.
It would also increase the penalties for employers who exploit temporary overseas workers. There are 732,750 temporary workers in Australia, including students, 457 visa workers and working holidaymakers.
Labor would impose a new criminal offence for employers who "deliberately exploit temporary overseas workers", even if they are employing the worker within the terms of their visa. The offence would be punishable by fines and up to two years' imprisonment.
Labor's employment and workplace relations spokesman, Brendan O'Connor, said the recent spate of cases involving underpayment, sham contracting and other exploitation required action.
O'Connor said Labor had met with workers around the country to investigate the problem and promised to consult with employers on the scale of the penalty increase.
"Recent examples of clear and widespread worker exploitation at notable companies have been met by silence and inaction from Malcolm Turnbull's Liberals, despite continuous calls from Labor for action to protect working people and jobs," O'Connor said.
"We will consult employers and their representatives, workers and unions on the scale of the increase to penalties to ensure there is an appropriate deterrent in place to protect workers from unscrupulous employers."
 Related:  Myer, 7-Eleven and Pizza Hut scandals show many workers don't get a fair go
In the past year, two 7-Eleven convenience stores have had their franchise agreements terminated for underpaying workers after a Fairfax investigation.
Pizza Hut delivery drivers have alleged  they were paid rates as low as $12 an hour while providing their own car, fuel and vehicle maintenance.
The fair work ombudsman is investigating the case of retailer Myer, whose cleaners alleged  they were denied pay and entitlements through the use of sham contracts and subcontracting.
Baiada food processing factories faced allegations of exploitation  and the fair work ombudsman found young poultry workers were paid as little as $11.50 an hour.
Labor announced the policy on the eve of the resumption of parliament, which sits on Tuesday to Thursday.

MPs to debate whether Financial Conduct Authority is up to job of regulating City; 
Commons to discuss on Monday whether FCA is fit for purpose in motion tabled after it dropped a banking investigation in December.

Jill Treanor and Julia Kollewe.

The Financial Conduct Authority is expected to face criticism on Monday when MPs debate a motion on whether it is up to the job of regulating behaviour in the City. 
The debate, tabled by Conservative MP Guto Bebb, will discuss "that this House believes that the Financial Conduct Authority in its current form is not fit for purpose; and has no confidence in its existing structure and procedures".
 Related:  George Osborne appoints Andrew Bailey as FCA chief
Speaking ahead of the debate, Bebb, who has campaigned for better treatment for small business, said he was motivated to table the debate after the FCA pulled its review into banking culture at the end of last year.
"Anybody who knows banks will find it impossible to say that bank behaviour was [not] motivated by financial inducement," the MP for Aberconwy said.
"We need to have a proper debate about what is going on with the FCA, how independent are they," said Bebb.
The decision by the FCA to abandon a review into the culture  of banks sparked a series of accusations that the Treasury had intervened - strongly denied by both the regulator and the Treasury - as part of a softer approach to the City.
The motion will be heard just days after George Osborne stunned the City by naming Andrew Bailey, a deputy governor of the Bank of England and the head of the Prudential Regulation Authority, as the chief executive of the FCA.
 Related:  New year, same old story as FCA lets bankers off hook by dropping review
Labour MP John Mann is co-sponsoring the motion and said he has no confidence in the regulator. "It is not fit for purpose," said Mann, who sits on the Treasury select committee. He is concerned the FCA's focus is shifting from so-called conduct issues to prudential regulation.
"On Monday I will reveal in the House of Commons a new scandal which the FCA is trying to sweep under the carpet, providing further proof that we need a strong, independent regulator, not another lackey for George Osborne and the banks," said Mann.
Mann is expected to accuse the FCA of failing to regulate foreign exchange firms tightly enough, to ensure they don't offer misleading exchange rates to consumers. 
The FCA has only been in existence since April 2013 when the coalition government disbanded the-then City regulator, the Financial Services Authority. The FCA was given responsibility for overseeing the behaviour of the City and the PRA, inside the Bank of England, was charged with regulating whether banks and insurance companies were strong enough to withstand market turbulence. 
The FCA and the Treasury declined to comment ahead of the debate. When Bailey was appointed, Osborne had said his appointment was "an important next step in the establishment of the FCA as a strong regulator, independent of government and industry".

Sir Terry Wogan: king of inoffensive mockery and self-deprecation - obituary; 
Hugely popular radio and TV broadcaster loved for the wry sense of humour he brought to his Radio 2 show, Blankety Blank and the Eurovision Song Contest.

Dennis Barker.

With his ready self-deprecation and an ability to mock inoffensively, Terry Wogan, who has died aged 77 after suffering from cancer, was for several decades one of the most popular personalities on both radio and television in Britain - in his words, a jobbing broadcaster. When he was in charge of the television game show Blankety Blank for four years from 1979, audiences exceeded 20 million. His weekday breakfast programme on Radio 2 (1972-84 and 1993-2009) reached 8 million listeners. And quite certainly some of the many millions who watched the Eurovision Song Contest, which he covered on radio and then TV from the early 1970s to 2008, did so more for his facetious commentaries than for the music.
Wogan began his broadcasting career in his native Ireland, but secured his status as a British audience-magnet with his eponymous television chat show, which ran for up to three times a week for a decade from 1982. His many guests included Rock Hudson, Dolly Parton, Raquel Welch, Lee Marvin, Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft. 
All his shows, from playing music to radio listeners at breakfast time to television in the evening, were exploitations of a personality that managed to be reassuring and yet also sharp-witted. With Wogan there was banter, but it was not always bland. And he was no pushover to those in power. When in 1975 BBC officials told him to tone down his quips at the expense of the director general, he immediately inflated them with even more surreal splendour: "I have the ultimate sanction. I can walk out."
Born in Limerick, Terry was the son of Michael, who worked in a branch of the grocers Leverett and Frye, and Rose. He grew up with the BBC radio Light Programme and its comedy shows.
At the age of five he went to Ferrybank prep school, which was run by nuns, but after 10 minutes walked home, and soon decided he was an atheist. When he was nine he went to Crescent College, Limerick, which was "not really nightmarish but the end of innocence", where he was taught by Jesuits. At 15, as a result of his father's promotion, the family moved to Dublin, where Terry attended Belvedere college, alma mater of James Joyce.
As a child Terry tended to withdraw from any group after a certain time, and admitted to being rather the same as an adult. During the various runs of the Wogan television chat show he later declared that, for him, the high point of the evening was dinner at home with his wife, Helen (nee Joyce). Having seen himself as "a well-behaved, conventional little mother's boy, afraid of his own shadow", once he had left Limerick he did not return until he was a star of the newly formed Irish radio and television service, RaidÌo TelefÌs …ireann (RT…), and was judging beauty contests.
Though he had vaguely wanted to be a journalist, his first jobs were with branches of the Royal Bank of Ireland. After four years with the bank, he saw an advertisement in the Irish Independent: the radio service wanted announcer-newsreaders. There was a training course of five evenings a week and 10,000 applicants, but Wogan had found "the only thing I could be good at". He especially relished a turn of duty that came round every four or five weeks. This was hospital requests, through which he discovered that ad-libbing from postcards and letters in between records was something he could do easily.
This ease became his trademark. When RT… opened its television service on New Year's Eve 1961, he was an obvious recruit, and soon found his face so irritatingly famous that he could no longer go into pubs. He began to form the view that, unlike radio, where listeners got to know and cherish their favourite personalities, television was instant fame that was instantly forgotten the moment a face disappeared. However, the television quiz show Jackpot, which he chaired, topped the ratings.
When he sent a tape of his radio work to the BBC Light Programme, the assistant head of the gramophone records department, Mark White - who was to become a mentor - offered him the chair of Midday Spin, a half-hour selection of records, which was made and broadcast from London, with his own commentary being inserted from RT… in Dublin.
Alternating between Dublin and London was congenial to him, but not to RT…. When he began Late Night Extra on Wednesdays for BBC Radio 1 and 2, flying back to Dublin afterwards, RT… told him to concentrate on his work for them - or else. Wogan opted for the "or else"; his first appearance on British television consisting of presenting a beauty contest with David Vine in 1973. He then took over from Peter West for seven seasons of Come Dancing.
In 1974 he launched his first chat show, Wogan's World, for BBC Midlands from Pebble Mill. After he had started presenting his Wogan chat show from the Shepherd's Bush Empire, a former variety theatre in west London, he took a break from breakfast radio. Not all guests were easy: George Best came on in a "footless" condition, and he found David Icke "a ranting demagogue", but kept his good humour. In 1978 Wogan was his usual ironic self when he appeared on Top of the Pops singing the Cornish folk song The Floral Dance. Surprisingly it reached No 21 in the charts.
Wogan also presented Auntie's Bloomers (1991-2001), the resurrection of BBC broadcasting fluffs and disasters, leaving when he thought it had no more to offer. By then he was mediating between the corporation and its deeply involved and demanding audience on Points of View (1999-2007).
For UKTV Gold he presented Wogan Now and Then from 2006, and for BBC1 he looked back over the previous 40 years in a two-part programme, Wogan's Ireland (2011). Last year he teamed up with London cabbie Mason McQueen for Terry and Mason's Great Food Trip, a culinary tour around Britain shown in half-hour episodes on BBC2. On Radio 2, he was back with a Sunday morning programme, from 2010 until last November.
During his days with Blankety Blank, the Christmas show of 1979 topped the seasonal ratings. He regarded the show as his lucky emblem, since it led to his receiving 10 TV Times awards in succession as most popular television personality; he then asked not to be entered again so that someone else could have a chance. He also had numerous Sony and Variety Club of Great Britain awards, and in 2010 the Television and Radio Indus tries Club gave him a lifetime achieve ment award. When Radio 2 turned 40 in 2007, he was voted its Ultimate Icon.
A succession of cheerful books included two memoirs, Is it Me? (2000) and Mustn't Grumble (2006). The Little Book of Common Sense (2014) shared some general observations along the lines of Radio 2's Pause for Thought. He was appointed OBE in 1997 and KBE in 2005. Dual citizenship made it possible for him to use the title Sir.
In addition to his regular shows over the years, he was on ready call for the "big occasion" and presented the 1976 and 1984 Olympic games.
Wogan was never touched by scandal. No one had an anecdote that showed him as ill-natured. One of the rare occasions on which he showed that he could put a heavy boot in when required came after a critic in the Times savaged his annual Children in Need fundraising programme (which he presented every year from 1980) by contending that "November is short of ersatz national days, except for the annual BBC Children in Need atrocity, an event better calculated than any other to make me contemplate self-harm."
Wogan, who was passionately protective of good causes, retorted in Mustn't Grumble : "Don't contemplate it, chum, do it. Start with your heart, if you can find it." He was patently on genuinely easy terms with his own.
He is survived by Helen, whom he married in 1965, two sons and a daughter. Another daughter died in infancy.

Rom-coms, hatchet jobs and Hot Shots: how movies bid presidents goodbye; 
As Barack Obama nears the end of his presidency, the new movie Southside With You depicts his first date with Michelle as a loving romance. Departing presidents don't usually get off so lightly ....

Stuart Jeffries.

American critics are drooling over the new movie about Michelle and Barack Obama's first date. Southside With You is "a sweet, mature drama with layers of social and racial issues, family dynamics and, yes - romance," according to Mashable. "The result makes you realise how few realistic and three-dimensional date movies have been made in an era of throbbing hook-up encounters and R-rated horny teen gross-outs," argues the Hollywood Reporter 's critic.
Southside with You is a meet-cute with a twist - When Potus met Flotus. It's about a hunkypants Harvard law graduate working a summer job at a Chicago law firm, where he falls in love with his no-less diverting boss, Michelle Robinson. The couple stroll through the summery city, visit a gallery, take in a movie and finally have ice-cream. During the evening they have the kiss that, apparently, recently made even hardened Sundance film festival goers come over all unnecessary. 
Movies about departing US presidents aren't supposed to be like this. Instead of praising their soon-to-be ex-presidents, American directors usually bury them. When George W Bush was slouching towards end-of-second-term oblivion in 2008, Oliver Stone released W, a film that depicted its eponymous hero as an incorrigible dumbass. "Iran is not Iraq and Iraq is not Iran. I know that," Bush says unconvincingly at one point. "The fact is you can't win," his mother, Barbara Bush, tells Dubya. "Why do you say that?" "Because you're too much like me. You're loud and you've got a short fuse. Now, Jeb is like your father. He thinks before he speaks."
Then there was Primary Colors, which came out in 1998, just as the Monica Lewinsky scandal was sullying President Bill Clinton's boner fides. Mike Nichols' adaptation of Joe Klein's novel dealt with a fictional southern governor called Jack Stanton (John Travolta), loosely modelled on Slick Willie, whose hopes of securing the Democratic party nomination are threatened by rumours of Clintonesque sexual indiscretions. "He's poked his pecker in some sorry trash bins," concludes Kathy Bates, playing a woman charged with investigating the governor's lurid past.
What Clinton didn't need at this difficult time, reputation-wise, was that kind of implicit ridicule. Nor did he need a celluloid Hillary surrogate played by Emma Thompson telling her kids : "Your grandfather was a great man. Jack Stanton could also be a great man, if he wasn't such a faithless, thoughtless, disorganised, undisciplined shit." But that's what he got.
In 1993, George HW Bush's presidency was celebrated by Lloyd Bridges in Hot Shots! Part Deux by a satirical reprise of the real-life moment the incumbent vomited sushi into the lap of a Japanese official.
This was undeferential enough, but two years previously Naked Gun 2Ω: The Smell of Fear concluded with an even more undignified satire on the president's wife. After saluting the crowds, our hero, Police Squad's Frank Drebbin (Leslie Nielsen), knocks Barbara Bush off a balcony and then tries to save her by grabbing at her dress. Sadly, it comes off in his hands, leaving the first lady dangling from the ledge, half naked and wholly ridiculous. They would never have done that to Michelle Obama.
And then there was Ronald Reagan, whose second term in the Oval Office was marked in Back to the Future II in 1989. There he was ridiculed as a video waiter - essentially a wizened bloke (think Max Headroom's great, great granddad) in a TV set charged with telling diners about today's specials.
Before Reagan, such scabrous movie treatments of incumbent presidents were scarcely thinkable. Even though All the President's Men (1976), starring Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford as Washington Post reporters exposing the Watergate affair, came out just two years after Nixon's resignation, Tricky Dicky's only appearance was on a TV screen.
Scriptwriters are presumably already eagerly sharpening their pencils for Trump: The Movie.

BBC personality questioned over alleged sexual assault; 
Unnamed star denies accusations, say police, and according to broadcaster is not currently engaged in any filming.

Staff and agencies.

A BBC TV personality has been questioned by police about an alleged sexual assault this month.
The man, who has not been identified, has denied the accusations regarding an assault on a 23-year-old male in a hotel room. The accused had been due to participate in filming for a BBC show, but has not done so after the corporation was made aware of the allegations. 
The BBC said the man was not currently taking part in any filming, when asked by the Mirror about the allegations. The paper said it was aware of the identity of the accused man.
He is expected to be questioned again by police next week about the alleged assault. It is not known where the incident occurred or which police force is involved in the investigation.
A police spokesperson told the Mirror that officers were "investigating the alleged sexual assault of a 23-year-old man". They added: "Our inquiries are continuing."
Last week a leaked version of Dame Janet Smith's report on the BBC's practices during the years that Jimmy Savile worked for the broadcaster pointed to a "deferential culture" and "untouchable stars". 
However, it said the BBC could not be criticised for failing to uncover Savile's "sexual deviancy". A spokesman said the BBC would not be commenting as it had not seen the draft or final version of Smith's report.
Her inquiry was set up in October 2012 in the wake of the Savile scandal, and has been subject to a string of delays. 
Police said this month that the report would be published in the next few weeks after deciding that it would not prejudice any ongoing investigations.

'Lord Libor' reveals financial system where bad apples have the midas touch; 
Former traders in London trial may have been cleared, but case highlights financial industry's superstars are also among the most toxic employees.

Suzanne McGee.

So it turns out that "Lord Libor" and "Big Nose" didn't do it, after all. Translation: a British jury acquitted six men of helping former trader Tom Hayes rig the world's mortgage markets. 
The idea that someone can rig the London inter-bank lending rates (Libor) should terrify us all. It's estimated that $300tn (£192tn) of contracts are based on Libor, setting borrowing rates for businesses and consumers from Sydney to New York and London.  
 The subprime mortgage bubble - also a product of greedy bankers run amok - may have a firmer hold on the public imagination and memory, thanks to the financial crisis that followed the bursting of that bubble in 2007 and 2008, and more recently, to the movie The Big Short. The efforts by bank traders (successful for several years) to rig Libor flowed directly from that crisis, as they tried to inflate their profits or creditworthiness. 
Libor, an average of the actual interest rates that banks will pay to borrow from other banks, depended on those banks being honest when they reported that number. Surprise, surprise: they weren't honest, and since the lid came off the scandal, virtually every major financial institution has lined up to strike a deal with regulators and pay a hefty penalty.
As frustrated and outraged onlookers found in the aftermath of the financial crisis, however, holding individuals accountable has been far, far tougher. So far only three men have been convicted for their role in the events: Tom Hayes, sentenced to 14 years in prison (reduced to 11 years on appeal) in England) and two British traders who worked for Rabobank, convicted of 28 counts of criminal fraud in a Manhattan court late last year. They are scheduled to be sentenced in March.
The colorfully nicknamed brokers found not guilty of helping Hayes interest rates called their trial a sham last week. And they are right. But what's wrong here is not British prosecutors but the global economic system.
Once again, Main Street and regulators are wrestling with the thorny issue of Wall Street's bad apples: something that Wall Street itself tends to deal with very, very poorly. 
There's a very good reason why. Those bad apples, sad to say, are also the individuals who, for many years, tend to generate the biggest profits for them. And legally so.
Consider Tom Hayes, whose boss, Sascha Prinz, pleaded with Jerker Johansson, CEO of UBS, to pay Hayes more to prevent Goldman Sachs from luring him away. Goldman was offering Hayes $3m a year, but Prinz said he was generating $30m to $45m a year in profits for UBS and was too valuable to lose. Johansson signed off on a $2.5m bonus.
This might actually have come as a warning sign of one kind of toxic employee, suggest Michael Housman and Dylan Minor, in a recently published working paper for the Harvard Business School. We're accustomed to thinking of toxic colleagues as just being incredibly annoying, hostile, or even downright unproductive, but the research by this duo into how to figure out which folks actually harm the organizations they work for sheds some interesting light on Wall Street. 
It turns out that superstar workers - who tend to flourish on Wall Street, because they bring in the big deals, land the big trades, and capture the big bonuses - are also among the most toxic employees an organization can have. Housman and Minor point to JPMorgan Chase's infamous "London Whale" rogue trader, Bruno Iksil, as one example of a toxic employee. Iksil cost the bank and its shareholders $6.2bn by hiding outsize derivative bets that went sour and what the SEC later described as "fraudulently" overvaluing those positions. Once again, although JP Morgan Chase forked over $1bn in fines, regulators and prosecutors haven't managed to hold individuals to account.
The fact that on Wall Street there tend to be clusters of individuals who are "overconfident (and) self-regarding" and to be such superstar performers might also be bad news for the institutions where they work. The more of them there are, the worse the cumulative effect and the greater the degree of contagion - the less a position is "monitored", the more likely a toxic person occupying it is to damage the business. 
Housman and Minor conclude that "avoiding toxic workers is ... better for the firm in terms of net profitability, despite losing out on a highly productive worker." 
That's a lesson that Wall Street has yet to learn, alas. True, the firms have paid out billions of dollars to mop up the messes created by their toxic workers, like Iksil or Hayes (to name only two of hundreds or thousands of bankers and traders whose lack of ethics has led them to push the envelope too far). 
But even the financial crisis - when the toxic behavior of the bad apples repackaging subprime mortgages into securities doomed to fail ended up causing some institutions to actually fail - doesn't seem to have caused bank leaders to realize that they need to proactively go on a hunt for bad apples, and start tossing them from the barrel. Too often tomorrow's "rogue traders" are today's star employees.
Consider the attitude of Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, to his own bank's recent encounters with toxic people. The London Whale? Why, initially, that was a "tempest in a teapot". Only reluctantly did Dimon accept that it was a big error, and acknowledge that he and the bank were guilty of "many errors" and "sloppiness". 
Still, last May, JPMorgan was in the news again when it paid out nearly $900m to settle felony charges of foreign currency rigging. The single culprit, the bank said, had been dismissed. "We demand and expect better of our people," Dimon said in a statement. "The lesson here is that the conduct of a small group of employees, or even a single employee, can reflect badly on all of us."
 That shouldn't have come as quite as much of an epiphany as it sounds that it may have done. Let's hope that Dimon, and his fellow Wall Street CEOs, are a bit quicker off the mark when it comes to reading the research produced by Housman and Minor, and absorbing its lessons. If they are, maybe we can look forward to a day when the phrase "bankster" can slip into the lists of archaic words. If not? Well, stay tuned for news of the next "rogue trader" who turns out to be anything but - and the next, and the next.
