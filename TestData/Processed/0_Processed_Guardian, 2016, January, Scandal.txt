Ready for jail, the woman at the heart of the latest Vatican scandal; 
Francesca Chaouqui, who is charged with leaking papers about alleged financial mismanagement, rejects her media portrayal as a temptress with a grudge against the church.

Stephanie Kirchgaessner in Rome.

When Francesca Chaouqui was summoned two months ago to a meeting with Vatican police, the public relations expert - who had served on a prominent Vatican commission examining financial reforms - willingly went along. She assumed it would be an hour-long affair.
Instead, the 33-year-old was arrested, interrogated and held for 72 hours within the Vatican walls - apart from a short stint in hospital after falling ill - and says she was denied access to a lawyer. "I was wearing very light clothing because I had been at home, and I stayed in those clothes for three days," she told the Guardian in a recent interview.
Since then, having been charged by Vatican prosecutors with leaking confidential documents to two journalists, a crime under Vatican law punishable by up to eight years in prison, Chaouqui has emerged as an unlikely protagonist in the biggest scandal to rock the Vatican under Pope Francis.
At the centre of the case are allegations that Chaouqui and two others stole documents they had gathered in the course of work on the Vatican commission and leaked them to journalists who used them to write explosive books about alleged financial mismanagement of church funds. The pope himself has suggested Chaouqui was lashing out at the church because she had not been offered a permanent position after the commission she served on was disbanded.

In Italy, where the story has created a media sensation, Chaouqui has been portrayed as an opportunistic temptress, a "sex bomb" who allegedly seduced a Spanish monsignor who served with her on the commission, and then convinced him to betray the church and leak the documents to the two journalists, Gianluigi Nuzzi and Emiliano Fittipaldi. 
The portrayal of Chaouqui, who had previously worked at the international law firm Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe and accountancy firm Ernst & Young, as a seductress was propelled in part by a picture of her and her husband that has circulated online. It is not graphic but appears to show both to be nude, with him playfully biting her shoulder.
Her shoulders hunched and with dark circles under her eyes, Chaouqui cut a far different figure in her interview with the Guardian from the one that has emerged on the front pages of Italian newspapers. Flanked by her well-known defence lawyer, Giulia Bongiorno, the devout Catholic came across as a wounded - if self-proclaimed - martyr who insists she is innocent of all the allegations but is willing to go to jail if the Vatican court finds her guilty.
"I took an oath of loyalty to that state, and that means accepting their rules, even if they are wrong. It's a monarchy, it's not a liberal state," she said. "The pope is not just a head of state, he is the head of my religion, he is God on Earth. If they find that I am guilty, I must go, I have no choice."
So far, the Vatican has not released any evidence in its case against Chaouqui or her co-defendants, the Spanish monsignor Lucio ¡ngel Vallejo Balda, a layperson named Nicola Maio, and the two journalists, who are all being tried together. But in Italian press reports, Balda has alleged that he was seduced by Chaouqui - who he also said told him she was a secret agent - and that he leaked the documents after being encouraged to do so.
Chaouqui denies they ever had sex, and indicates the suggestion is the most ludicrous thing she has ever heard. "It was friendship, closeness, confidence but nothing more," she said.
She does admit, however, that WhatsApp messages between the two included discussions about sex. But she says excerpts published in newspapers have been taken out of context. In one, she offered to introduce the monsignor to a relative, whom she described as "36 years old. Soft."
"Some things are true, for example when I say to Balda, 'have sex because it's better for your mind', that's true. But it's in the context of a joke," she said. "Others are taken out of context."
Bongiorno points out that the statement Balda gave to reporters included "many false things that are the fruit of fantasy" - for instance that Chaouqui was connected to the Chinese mafia. But only one of the allegations was seized upon in press reports: that the two had a sexual relationship.

"The collective opinion says 'we believe in the sex'. But it's part of a list of things that are fantasies," Bongiorno said. The attorney also insists other WhatsApp messages that will be used as evidence in the trial have proven Balda had a direct relationship with the journalists in question, without any interference by Chaouqui.
Both see other forces at play in the prosecution and vilification of Chaouqui.
"I believe that in Italy - not abroad - the fact of being a young woman in a position of power is seen with great prejudice ... it often happens that a young woman who may be cute and is in a position of power must have something wrong with her. This case is one of a thousand examples," Bongiorno said.
Asked about the photos of her online, Chaouqui said: "This is a joke with my husband. These were on Facebook before the nomination, I didn't have the intelligence at the moment of my nomination to close my profile. I had a normal profile and a normal life."
Chaouqui, who is expecting her first child, expresses admiration and respect for the pope. Both she and her attorney see the charges as a response to Chaouqui's alleged role as a "shield" for him in her work on the commission, though neither offers any examples. The suggestion points to the widely held view that Pope Francis has internal enemies within the church who object to his reform proposals, particularly those that would shed more light on the church's murky finances. 
"The trial should not only be framed only as a leaked information trial - there's also a trial that takes into account the role of Chaouqui, for what she was doing," Bongiorno said.

But that narrative seems to contradict the pope's own statements. Speaking about the case in November during a press conference on his papal plane, Francis said "a mistake was made" when Balda and Chaouqui were asked to join the papal commission.
"I think I am right in saying that it was [Balda] who said she was someone who was well acquainted with the world of business relations. They worked and when the work was complete, [other commission] members kept some positions in the Vatican. Mrs Chaouqui did not stay in the Vatican: some say she was angry about this," Francis said.
Chaouqui says she does not know why she was nominated to join the commission back in 2013, and denies that strings were pulled on her behalf.
"I am Catholic so it's clear, if the pope calls you, you don't ask too many questions. I made a mistake. It was a big error [to join the commission]. I should have asked myself more questions, especially to understand legally what was happening to me, because my position as an Italian citizen that has a state secret in another state is not a simple thing," she said. 
She called the Vatican a "sacred monster", meaning it is untouchable.
 Among aspects of the case that confound Bongiorno are the Vatican's alleged repeated violations of Chaouqui's due process rights, first by interrogating her without an attorney, by forbidding Bongiorno from defending her in the trial - she has been given a Vatican attorney instead - and by allegedly failing to put forward any documentary evidence against her client.
Bongiorno insists that there are several grounds under which she could contest the validity of the trial if found guilty. A person who is convicted under Vatican law is supposed to be held in an Italian jail, but it is far from clear that Italy would co-operate in this case.
When pressed to explain why she would not fight a possible jail sentence if found guilty - she and Bongiorno disagree on whether she would even appeal - Chaouqui said: "If Jesus had gone away from [Pontius] Pilate's judgment, what would have happened?"
Bongiorno then interjected. "Don't say these things, otherwise they'll say you are comparing yourself to God. In any case, let's just say she knows scripture by heart, so she cites it whenever she speaks," she said.

The business figures with most at stake in 2016; 
Guardian writers pick the people facing the toughest challenges in the year ahead, from chiefs of major corporations such as Rolls-Royce, Tesco or Lloyds to the heads of the Bank of England, IMF and CBI.

Jill Treanor, Terry Macalister, Sarah Butler, Larry Elliott, Heather Stewart, Sean Farrell, Gwyn Topham, Simon Goodley and Nils Pratley.

The new year brings new challenges for some of the highest-profile figures in business. Others continue to be dogged by past problems. 
For some, such as AntÛnio Horta OsÛrio, the chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group, 2016 raises the prospect of the government selling off its remaining stake in the bailed-out banks. For others, such as David Potts, boss of Morrisons supermarkets, there is the fear of a takeover. Ben van Beurden, meanwhile, chief executive of the Anglo-Dutch oil group Shell, has the task of pulling off a £40bn deal with BG first agreed before the oil price crashed.
It is also a critical year for policymakers. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, is facing questions about whether interest rates will remain at their record low of 0.5% by the end of the year. 
Here Guardian writers select the figures with most at stake in 2016. 

Ben van Beurden
Few chief executives enter 2016 under as much pressure as Ben van Beurden, the Shell boss. He took the top job two years ago  with a relatively easy brief to chop the underperforming businesses built up during a period of high oil prices by his seemingly profligate predecessor, Peter Voser.
But after a period of successful cost-cutting the 57-year-old Shell lifer has found the price of oil collapsing, expensive exploration in the Arctic going nowhere, and his claims to lead a carbon-friendly company ridiculed. 
A decision to use low crude prices as an opportunity for a  £40bn takeover of rival BG  has left him facing City critics worried that Shell's sacred dividend is now under threat as the price of crude plunges relentlessly downwards. 
The UN climate change deal last month may have spelled decline for fossil fuels that will play out over decades, but Van Beurden is under the cosh right now. Terry Macalister

Mark Carney
It has been a while since anyone referred to Mark Carney, the slick Canadian in charge of the Bank of England, as a "rock star central banker". One MP has even compared his repeated promises of interest rate rises to the empty sweet-talk of an "unreliable boyfriend".
Another of those pledges has failed to materialise in recent weeks. The governor predicted at a speech in Lincoln cathedral in the summer that the decision about raising rates would "come into sharper relief around the turn of this year". It was part of a strategy of "forward guidance" meant to allow markets and consumers to prepare for shifts in policy.
But the final monetary policy committee meeting of the year came and went  with only one of its nine rate-setting members voting for an immediate increase. And inflation remains at just 0.1%, instead of bouncing back towards the Bank's 2% target. 
Carney, hand-picked by the UK chancellor, George Osborne, to drag the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street into the 21st century, has blamed outside events, including the plunging oil price, for his predictions going awry. 
But Bank-watchers are now asking whether rates will remain at their record low of 0.5% until the end of 2016: and if so, whether something is fundamentally wrong with Carney's analysis of the economy. Heather Stewart

AntÛnio Horta OsÛrio
The Lloyds Banking Group chief executive has had a mantra since taking the helm of the bailed-out bank in March 2011: "to fix this bank and help taxpayers get their money back".
Horta-OsÛrio is tantalisingly close to achieving the goal. The taxpayer stake has already been reduced from the 43% it stood at when he took charge, to less than 10% as 2016 dawned. 
 Related:  Osborne prepares to pick right moment for Lloyds share sale
But the last chunk of shares may also prove to the toughest to shift. George Osborne has pledged to sell £2bn of them to the public  at a 5% discount to the prevailing market price. The chancellor has also promised that those who hold their shares for a year will be given a bonus share for every 10 held, with the bonus capped at £200 per investor.
With the taxpayer breaking even on a sale when the shares are at 73.6p, Horta-OsÛrio will be watching the stockmarket even more closely than usual. The year 2016 could be his make or break year. Extricating taxpayers from a bank they pumped £20bn into amid the 2008 banking crisis could be the evidence that the Portuguese banker needs to prove he has fixed the bank. He may then face questions about what to do next.  Jill Treano r

Carolyn Fairbairn
Everything is looking good for Carolyn Fairbairn, who became the first woman director-general of the CBI last year. The UK economy is growing at a fair lick, unemployment is coming down, and the corporation tax rate is coming down.
To be sure, the employers' group has a few gripes with the government. It is, for example, not overly keen on Osborne's plan for an apprenticeship levy. But, generally, Fairbairn would be looking forward to a trouble-free first year in the job were it not for one big cloud on the horizon: Europe.
If things go to plan, the prime minister, David Cameron, intends to hold a referendum on UK membership of the European Union during 2016, with dates already being pencilled in as early as June or July.
 Related:  Stuart Rose on the EU referendum: 'The sooner we get it done, the better'
The Brexit debate will be highly charged and hugely divisive for the UK and, like the rest of the nation, business remains split on the issue. The CBI's own polling shows that a majority of members in favour of remaining within a reformed EU, but there is a small and vocal minority that believes the UK would be better off outside.
Those in favour of Brexit will take some convincing that the prime minister has succeeded in his attempts to renegotiate the terms of EU membership, and Fairbairn's challenge in 2016 will be to prevent an acrimonious split in her organisation. Larry Elliott

Dave Lewis
                     Dave Lewis  went into 2015 with all guns blazing, launching a drastic shakeup at the UK's biggest supermarket chain. He announced plans to cut thousands of jobs, close stores, abandon long-planned developments, sell off foreign operations and slash prices.
But a year on, with much of that work completed, Tesco is still struggling to win over shoppers. The supermarket's share price has sunk to an 18-year low as sales continue to fall at a dizzying pace, according to the latest industry data. 
Tesco is not the only big supermarket chain to endure falling sales. But as the biggest of the bunch, there's a feeling that Tesco could and should be faring better.
Revelations of losses at Tesco subsidiaries including the Dobbies garden centre chain, Giraffe restaurants and Harris + Hoole coffee shops have also made clear the breadth of the problems that Lewis and his team face. 
Lewis' honeymoon period is well and truly over and he has a lot to prove in 2016. Impatient shareholders, and the credit rating agencies which have such influence over the cost of servicing Tesco's massive debt pile, want to see signs that his medicine is working. 
Lewis will also have to carefully navigate the fallout from an accounting scandal which broke soon after his arrival  in 2014. Might he have to negotiate a deal with the Serious Fraud Office, which has been investigating? How will he handle any litigious shareholders? 
Tesco will also have to answer questions over its relations with suppliers when a Grocery Code Adjudicator investigation reports this month.
Putting past errors safely to bed while fighting to secure Tesco's future in a rapidly changing grocery market should provide plenty of challenges for this veteran retailer in 2016. Sarah Butler

Warren East
When Warren East came out of retirement to run Rolls-Royce in July things were obviously awry at the one-time beacon of British engineering. After a series of profit warnings before he joined, East, the former boss of the chipmaker ARM Holdings, issued his own warning after two days in the job and in November he said Rolls was so opaque that financial forecasting was futile. 
East has promised to cut costs and slash bureaucracy to get Rolls firing on all cylinders again. He is due to give more details in February. But Rolls is buffeted by falling demand for private jets and for boats and equipment for oil and gas production as well as a switch by airlines away from the wide-bodied planes that Rolls makes engines for. 
Complicating matters further, the low-key but insistent US activist fund ValueAct has bought 10% of Rolls and wants a seat on the board. The government is also involved and has drafted plans to nationalise Rolls's nuclear submarine division or force the division - or all of Rolls - to merge with BAE Systems.
East, 53 and already wealthy and respected after running ARM successfully for 12 years, no doubt thought he had the energy for another challenge - but what a challenge. Sean Farrell

David Potts
David Potts is running the smallest of the UK's major supermarkets but arguably he has the biggest turnaround job on his hands.
Morrisons' northern heartland puts it right on the frontline of the battle with discounters Aldi and Lidl, and Potts must find a way to hold on to his weekly share of the shopping basket.
He is hoping to score some wins by fixing the basics of service, availability and quality neglected under the previous management team. 
Potts sensibly sold off Morrisons' poorly performing M Local convenience store chain. He still has work to do to get a better deal out of an online joint venture with Ocado.
Improving efficiency and getting the best out of Morrisons' food processing divisions will also prove important in cutting prices for shoppers and so making that extra trip to a discounter less enticing.
Takeover rumours circled more than once in 2015, and there is no doubt Morrisons is vulnerable  after slipping out of the FTSE 100. Sarah Butler

Mark Carne
Mark Carne stepped straight from the oilfields to the top job in the UK rail industry in April 2014, taking over as chief executive of Network Rail from one of the golden boys of British infrastructure, Sir David Higgins. 
Unfortunately for Carne, the latent problems in rail infrastructure swiftly became plain. Not least, that his organisation had signed up to an overambitious, poorly scoped and costed five-year  plan pushed by Whitehall and lapped up by ministers. It was a plan it could not deliver - especially once it could no longer borrow funds to mask inefficiency. 
                     Chaos from over-running engineering works last Christmas also left Carne in the firing line. While new directors have been parachuted in, there has been a feeling that Carne, well-liked and highly regarded, has inherited too much mess. 
He has spelled out a vision for the future, both technological - the digital railway - and cultural, with a more diverse and empowered workforce at Network Rail. But his organisation is likely to face calls for radical reform this year, and Carne may no longer be given the benefit of the doubt should further calamities occur. Gwyn Topham

Dave Forsey
Running a company with the reputational problems of Sports Direct will always be a high-pressure job. But 2016 is promising to be even more so for its bosses Dave Forsey, the chief executive, and the founder Mike Ashley.
An investigation by the Guardian prompted MPs to demand Mike Ashley face questions over pay and working conditions at the group's warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire. The company has promised £10m to give staff a pay rise, but that was immediately dismissed by Britain's largest trade union Unite as no more than a PR stunt.
Ashley's summons before the House of Commons and the results of an internal review are certain to keep practices at the FTSE 100 firm in the spotlight.
Forsey, meanwhile, is charged with a criminal offence for allegedly failing to give the 30 days' notice required for redundancies under employment law, after the group's subsidiary USC went into administration in January last year.
Forsey denies the charge. The next hearing in the case is scheduled at Chesterfield magistrates court in March, while a separate civil conduct investigation was kicked off by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) in October. BIS has the power to ban somebody from serving as a director for up to 15 years. Simon Goodley

Ivan Glasenberg
It was a humbling 2015 for Glasenberg, the mining industry's highest-profile and most opinionated chief executive. In September, as shareholders grew nervous about Glencore's ability to weather the storm in commodity markets, the company became the first London-listed big miner to chop its dividend and raise new capital - around £1.6bn.
Glasenberg dipped into his back pocket to find £138m to take up his slice of the new shares. Even that display of confidence didn't stop the rot. The share price is currently 90p - it stood at 530p when it floated in 2011.
Glasenberg needs two things in 2016. First, he has to demonstrate that his various plans to reduce Glencore's debt - via cuts, disposals and deals - can be achieved. He has started promisingly, and has already pledged that the original $10bn goal can be exceeded by $3bn. But 2016 is about securing the targets. Even on the company's own projections, borrowings will still be $18bn-$19bn at the end of 2016, which leaves little room for error.
The second thing Glasenberg needs is some luck. Nothing would restore investors' faith like rising commodity prices, especially copper. That, though, is entirely outside his control. Nils Pratley

Christine Lagarde
Christine Lagarde's day job, running the International Monetary Fund in Washington, is unlikely to get any easier in 2016, with what she calls "mediocre" global growth expected and a decision looming on whether the IMF should contribute to the latest Greece bailout.
The suave former French finance minister may also have hoped to be polishing up her CV for a potential run at the ElysÈe Palace in 2017. Instead she will have to prepare herself to face trial.
In September, a French court recommended Lagarde be acquitted over the long-running saga of a (EURO)400m (£293m) taxpayer-funded payout to controversial financier Bernard Tapie during the financial crisis. But last month, the Cour de Justice de la RÈpublique, which tackles allegations of wrongdoing by ministers, ruled she must appear in court, charged with "negligence by a person in a position of public authority".
So far, the IMF has expressed confidence in Lagarde's ability to focus on her job; but she may ultimately struggle to combine acting as one of the figureheads of the global economy with the public scrutiny of her record in office that will inevitably accompany a trial. Heather Stewart

Simon Danczuk's ex-wife threatens to change daughter's surname; 
Sonia Rossington reportedly texts suspended Labour MP to say he is bringing shame on his young children.

Jamie Grierson.

The first wife of Simon Danczuk, the Labour MP who was suspended from the Labour party amid a sexting scandal, has threatened to change their daughter's surname.
Sonia Rossington told Rochdale Online  that she was appalled that Danczuk, 49, had allegedly sent sexually explicit text messages to a 17-year-old girl. 
                     The Sun reported that Danczuk, who has been the MP for Rochdale since 2010, sent the messages to Sophena Houlihan after she asked him for a job as a case worker in his constituency office. 
Danczuk, who has played a leading role in the fight to expose historical child sex abuse, allegedly told Houlihan that he was "horny" and asked her if she wanted "spanking".
 Related:  Simon Danczuk apologises unreservedly after explicit texts claims
Rossington told Rochdale Online that Danczuk has a daughter "not much younger than the girl he wants to 'spank'", and a son who was a bit older. 
She said she sent her ex-husband a text for the first time in several years warning him: "Can you please stop embarrassing them? They are children growing up with your surname. If you resort to stripping yourself of any further dignity, I will change your daughter's surname, if only to protect her against your stupidity." 
Rossington, from Darwen, Lancashire, said the pair's 13-year-old daughter was aware of the reports surrounding her father.
"Why can he not think of his children and the devastating effect his selfish antics have on them? It has been one thing after another after another. Will it ever end? Will he ever stop and think about the damage he is doing to his children?"
Danczuk has been widely praised for his work exposing Cyril Smith, the late Liberal MP, as a paedophile. He co-wrote a book on Smith and first named him as a child abuser in parliament, months before the police confirmed that the late MP should have been prosecuted over abuse claims.
Greater Manchester police confirmed that they had looked into a report that Danczuk had been "communicating inappropriately with a teenage girl" after a complaint was made to them on 29 December 2015.
"This matter was looked into and it has been determined that no offences have been committed," they said in a statement.

Rolls-Royce faces new questions in Brazil corruption investigation; 
Firm declines to answer claims against agent Julio Faerman, who is charged with bribery, money-laundering and tax evasion.

Harry Davies.

                     Rolls-Royce is facing fresh questions over its ties to an influential Brazilian businessman after he was charged in connection with a high-profile corruption investigation known as Operation Black Blood.
The businessman, who worked as a representative for Rolls-Royce in Brazil, was charged before Christmas with alleged bribery, money-laundering and tax evasion as part of a scheme involving a Dutch company and Brazil's state-owned oil giant Petrobras.
Rolls-Royce has repeatedly declined to comment on its relationship with the businessman, Julio Faerman, who told the Guardian his company acted as an agent when Rolls-Royce sold power turbines to Petrobras for offshore oil platforms. Faerman denies any wrongdoing. 
The British engineering group is currently cooperating with Brazilian authorities investigating alleged corruption at Petrobras and its contractors. Earlier this year, allegations emerged that Rolls-Royce had paid bribes to Petrobras executives and politicians via its agent in exchange for a $100m (£67.7m) contract with the oil company.
The allegations against Rolls-Royce form part of a widespread, multibillion-dollar scandal that has engulfed Petrobras and other major Brazilian and foreign companies. The scandal, which continues to unfold, has had a profound impact on Brazil's economy and political landscape.
The prosecutors behind Operation Black Blood have charged 12 individuals, including Faerman and his business partner, for their alleged participation in a long-running bribery scheme between Petrobras and one of its major contractors, SBM Offshore, which builds specialist ships for the oil and gas industry. 
Faerman, a former sales agent for SBM in Brazil, was allegedly involved in arranging multimillion-dollar bribes for the Dutch company. Payments of at least $46m were made via Swiss bank accounts, acccording to a statement from federal prosecutors in Rio de Janeiro. 
Senior SBM executives, including its current chief executive, are among those charged, as well as former Petrobras executives such as Pedro Barusco, who has alleged in testimony that he received bribes from Rolls-Royce. 
Rolls-Royce declined to answer the Guardian's questions about its relationship with Faerman. Echoing previous statements about allegations in Brazil, a spokesman said the company has "repeatedly made clear it will not tolerate business misconduct of any kind".
He said: "We have confirmed that we are cooperating with investigating authorities in Brazil, but are unable to comment further on the nature of that co-operation."
In an email, Faerman told the Guardian he has "not committed any irregularity related to Rolls-Royce's activities in Brazil". 
He said he was unable to comment on the SBM case because of a plea bargain he had signed with the Brazilian authorities. He declined to comment on a report in the Folha de S„o Paulo newspaper before Christmas that said he had admitted to paying bribes in the SBM case and been ordered to pay back $54m.
The latest development comes as Rolls-Royce is also still under criminal investigation in the UK over bribery allegations in Asia. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) launched its investigation in December 2013. Three months later, Rolls-Royce said it was also cooperating with investigators at the US Department of Justice.
The Guardian understands that the SFO met Brazilian prosecutors earlier this year in connection with the Petrobras affair. The SFO has previously indicated the investigation concerns a number of Rolls-Royce devisions, but declined to comment on whether it is now considering the group's activities in Brazil. 
Rolls-Royce is currently undergoing company-wide upheaval after a series of profit warnings over the past two years. Earlier this month, Warren East, who became chief executive in July, ordered a drastic restructuring of the group in an effort to cut costs.
In Brazil, the sprawling investigation into the Petrobras affair, known as Operation Car Wash, intensified in December when federal police conducted 53 raids across seven states, including senior politicians' residences. About 30 foreign companies are believed to be under investigation. 
Responding to the charges against its senior executives, SBM said in a statement there were "no impediments" to either continuing in their roles. "We have no doubts regarding the integrity of both," the company said. 
In July, the Guardian reported that SBM would receive £34m  worth of financial support from the UK's export finance agency despite its involvement in the scandal. The significant financial support will go towards one of SBM's flagship oil projects in Brazil.

The Convenient Marriage by Georgette Heyer - swash and swoon; 
All hail the queen of the Regency romance, whose glorious romps demand to be shared with new generations of readersGuardian Witness: which books do you love to share?Read more in our 'A book to share' series.

Alison Flood.

I adored Georgette Heyer's Regency romances when I was younger. My mother had tons of them and, starting with Regency Buck - instantly captivated by the beautiful Judith Taverner, she with the "decided air of resolution in the curve of her mouth" and the fabulous romance with her guardian, the Fifth Earl of Worth - I raced through them all. I've not read her for some time, but after a recent sojourn into the hugely enjoyable novels of Harriet Evans, into each of which Evans manages to shoehorn a Heyer reference, I picked up the novel which was my favourite in my teens, The Convenient Marriage, and have been in a reading bliss ever since.  
It opens with despair in the respectable but poverty-stricken Winwood family: eldest daughter Lizzie, the Beauty, is about to be offered for by Lord Rule, but is promised to Edward Heron. The family need the money the marriage to Rule would bring: son Pelham has run up a fair few gambling debts ("the Fatal Tendency in us Winwoods"). Middle sister Charlotte isn't interested - "The very notion of Matrimony is repugnant to me. I have long made up my mind to be a Prop to Mama" - and so Horatia, just 17 and with "nothing that declared her lineage except her nose", courts scandal by setting out to Rule's house to offer herself as a Sacrifice. 
"Of c-course I know it ought to be Charlotte, for she is the elder, but she said nothing would induce her to m-marry you.' His lips quivered. 'In that case,' he said, 'it is fortunate that I did not solicit the honour of Miss Charlotte's hand in marriage.'" 
Horry lays out her faults - "I know I'm not a Beauty ... But I have got the Nose, sir ... And p-perhaps you could become used to my eyebrows? ... You m-may have n-noticed that I have a-a stammer." 
Rule is charmed and they make a bargain - she won't interfere with him, he will organise a captaincy for Edward Heron, and they shall "deal famously" with each other. 
The Convenient Marriage has everything you'd expect from a Regency romance - swooning females being revived with hartshorn, highwaymen, lost heirlooms, dancing, card parties, and a lazily amused hero. It also has Horry, entirely charming and wonderful. "Marcus," Rule's sister asks him. "'Is the girl a minx?'" No, he replies. "'She is not, Louisa. I am not at all sure that she is not a heroine.'" 
And I'd forgotten just how funny Heyer is, with her distressed females talking in capitals - "my Days are Numbered" - and the most understatedly comic, sparkling dialogue I've read for ages. Take this scene - Horry has just lamped her would-be rapist with a poker and fled his house at two in the morning, luckily running into Pelham and his friend, Sir Roland, on the street, both of them somewhat the worse for wear. 
 'D'you suppose she killed him, Pom?' 'Might have,' said Sir Roland judicially. 'Lay you five to one she didn't,' offered the Viscount. 'Done!' said Sir Roland. 'Tell you what,' said the Viscount suddenly. 'I'm going to see.' Horatia caught him by the skirts of his coat. 'No, you sh-shan't! You've got to take me home.' 'Oh, very well,' replied the Viscount, relinquishing his purpose. 'But you've no business to go killing people with a poker at two in the morning. It ain't genteel.' Sir Roland came unexpectedly to Horatia's support. 'Don't see that,' he said. 'Why shouldn't she hit Lethbridge with a poker? You don't like him, I don't like him.' 'No,' said the Viscount, acknowledging the truth of this statement. 'But I wouldn't hit him with a poker. Never heard of such a thing.' 
It is utterly delightful, all of it, and I am going to be sharing Heyer novels from now on with anyone I know who is in need of a pick-me up. She sounds, by the way, equally brilliant in person, grumpily describing her fans  "obviously feeble-minded" and launching a blistering attack on Barbara Cartland for alleged plagiarism ("I think I could have borne it better had Miss Cartland not been so common-minded, so salacious and so illiterate"). All hail Georgette Heyer: queen of the Regency period and devilish good fun.

UK in 'one of the great reforming decades', says David Cameron; 
PM declares he has no new year's resolutions - but names low home ownership, poverty, poor social mobility and extremism as priorities.

Frances Perraudin.

The UK is in "one of the great reforming decades" in its history, David Cameron has said in a new year's message which pledged to crack down on Islamic State sympathisers.
"For me, there are no new year's resolutions, just the resolve to continue delivering what we promised in our manifesto," said the prime minister, naming the problems of low home ownership, poverty, poor social mobility and extremism as his four priorities in 2016. 
"If we really get to grips with these problems this year, we won't just be a richer nation, but a stronger, more unified, more secure one," he said. "It won't be easy. These problems have been generations in the making. And many of them are tangled together."

Writing for the website ConservativeHome, Cameron said: "I genuinely believe we are in the middle of one of the great reforming decades in our history - what I would call a 'turnaround decade', where we can use the platform of our renewed economic strength to go for real social renewal."
The prime minister added 2016 would be a "test of our mettle" as he pledged action to tackle the "poisonous narrative" which led some Britons to turn against their country. 
The Prime Minister said: "These are the big challenges of our age, some of the biggest our nation has ever faced and this year is a test of our mettle - whether we put up with poverty or put an end to it; ignore the glass ceiling or smash it; abandon the tenant or help make them a homeowner; appease the extremist or take apart their ideology piece by piece. 
"When our national security is threatened by a seething hatred of the West, one that turns people against their country and can even turn them into murderous extremists, I want us to be very clear: you will not defeat us. 
"And we will not just confront the violence and the terror; we will take on their underlying poisonous narrative of grievance and resentment. We will come down hard on those who create the conditions for that narrative to flourish. 
"And we will have greater confidence in, indeed we will revel in, our way of life. Because if you walk our streets, learn in our schools, benefit from our society, you sign up to our values - freedom, tolerance, responsibility, loyalty." 
In a thinly-veiled jibe at the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Cameron argued that while some people shout into megaphones, wave banners and sign petitions, the government was making difficult decisions "in order to defeat these social scourges and deliver real security".
"So while others are on protest march, we remain on the long walk to a greater Britain... We won't get there overnight. But during 2016, we will make some of our most significant strides yet."
On the subject of inequality, Cameron said too many people in the UK were stopped from reaching their potential because of their background. "Just consider this. Right now, there are more young black men in prison than studying at our top universities," he said.
"That scandal brings together so many of these problems I have spoken about: poor life chances that, though they never excuse a life of crime, often find people heading down that track; poor schooling, because that holds people back; discrimination, because there is even evidence to suggest that men from ethnic minority backgrounds are more likely to get a custodial sentence than white men; and extremism, which sometimes is even incubated in state institutions, such as prisons."

The Conservative party's attitude to racial inequality was this week brought under the spotlight when Oliver Letwin, the prime minister's policy chief, was forced to issue a statement apologising for any offence caused by a confidential memo from 1985, released by the National Archives, in which he blamed the Tottenham and Handsworth riots on "bad moral attitudes".
The prime minister also used his new year's message to argue that it was the government's "competent management of the economy" that meant flood defences and emergency services were properly funded. "So when we face unprecedented and unexpected flooding we are able to give help to families when they need it," he added. 
The government has come in for criticism in recent weeks for failing to spend enough on flood defences and repeatedly postponing a prevention scheme for the Cumbrian town of Kendal, which was badly hit by Storm Desmond. 
A referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union is expected in 2016 and Cameron said he was fighting hard to fix the aspects of the UK's membership of the EU that causes "so much frustration in Britain", but that it was difficult to negotiate with 27 other countries. 
"But throughout we are driven by one consideration: what is best for Britain's economic and national security," he said, adding: "In the end, you will decide whether we are stronger and better off with our European neighbours as part of the European Union, or on our own."

Fifa and IAAF endure grim 2015 but corruption crises far from over; 
Some of those who have profited from football and athletics over the past three decades have been brought to book but the champagne should be kept on ice.

Owen Gibson.

Far from shaking off a hangover on New Year's Day, the dank fug that enveloped world sport in 2015 as it lurched from crisis to crisis like a drunken reveller looks set to only intensify in the coming months.
For those looking through a glass half full, the past year was one where light was finally shone on dark corners and the stench that had emanated from the black granite boardroom in Fifa's opulent $300m headquarters for decades began to clear.
It was the year when the scale of the alleged corruption at the world athletics governing body was brought to public attention in such a violent and jaw-dropping manner that it is becoming increasingly clear that the sport is faced with an existential crisis.

And yet, for all that the turn of the year is traditionally associated with a desire to look forward with optimism, the actions of those supposedly leading the clean-up from the inside have so far done little to inspire confidence.
Criminal investigations in the US, Switzerland and France will take their course and more revelations are imminent about just how deep this corrosive culture of patronage, corruption and culpability runs.
All the while, trust in sport will continue to ebb away. In football the irony is Fifa has endured the darkest year in its 111-year history as the game continues to boom around the world - commercially and culturally. Even while at its lowest point in the wake of the dramatic Baur Au Lac raids on 27 May, Fifa's officials were busy putting the final touches to what was an organisationally successful women's World Cup in Canada.
For millions of children around the world, Fifa 2016 still meant a new video game to rip open on Christmas Day rather than a byword for corruption and the cartoonish, gluttonous excess epitomised by Chuck Blazer - the former Fifa executive who ratted out his colleagues when faced with a tax bill for millions of dollars on undeclared ill gotten gains.
But meanwhile, the game was being hollowed out from the inside by the actions of those who might yet end up killing the goose that laid the golden eggs by robbing international football of its power and primacy. Not only by those who brazenly lined their own pockets by taking cuts of TV deals, World Cup tickets and other scams but by those who tolerated and encouraged such practices. And those who looked the other way or pleaded ignorance, happy to carry on turning up for meaningless committee meetings, staying in luxury hotels and picking up generous expenses (and expensive watches).
And those, such as their now disgraced leader Sepp Blatter, who used the system they created to propagate a lifestyle and sense of power and entitlement from which they became indivisible.

Look at the bribery allegations that have now enveloped just about every World Cup bidding process since 1998 and they all have in common the fact that money was channelled to voters for development purposes that was later pocketed as bribes.
At its most nefarious, this meant the US Department of Justice alleging the former Concacaf president Jack Warner had misappropriated funds meant for Haiti earthquake victims. At its most brazen, it meant Blazer with his globe trotting tour of world leaders and his apartment for his cats, skimming millions upon millions of dollars from commercial contracts on an industrial scale.
But it was also an everyday practice for many of those that inhabited the shameless universe painstakingly revealed by Andrew Jennings and David Yallop more than 15 years ago. Further back, Blatter was spawned by Horst Dassler, the Adidas scion who looms so large in the commercialisation of modern sport, and Jo„o Havelange, the now disgraced Brazilian who minted the modern Fifa way.
If the US investigations have mostly centred on the US, Central and South America for the simple reason that those were the payments channelled through American accounts, then it would be naive to assume similar cascading layers of payments and favours were not also at work in other parts of the world - the revelations are likely to tumble forth for months if not years to come.
And as the rapid downfall of Michel Platini from Uefa president and hot favourite to succeed Blatter proved, as the once-revered three-times European player of the year struggled to explain away a £1.35m payment, Europe was far from immune.
A year that began with a shabby Fifa TV rights deal with Fox to smooth the path to moving the Qatar 2022 World Cup to winter at a meeting in Doha ended with the sight of Blatter, frail but still defiant, promising to fight on  against his eight-year ban in the face of all available odds. The fact he and Platini exited railing against the unfairness of the Fifa ethics committee, so often shamelessly used by Blatter to punish his enemies and suit his own ends, was one of many ironies behind their demise.
But now the mighty have fallen, the question is: what next? Those behind the reform proposals that will be voted on in February at the same extraordinary Congress that will elect Blatter's successor are privately vigorously arguing they will set the tone for a new Fifa. They argue the emphasis should be on the new structural blueprint they will lay out rather than the misdemeanours of the personalities currently passing through Brooklyn courtrooms.

There are two problems here. One is the fatigued notion that we have heard it all before. Reform road maps, transparency pledges and vows of good governance have been endlessly promised down recent years sometimes by the very people now under arrest or cast from the game in disgrace.
The public has every right to judge Fifa on actions rather than words, even if a promised reform package that includes separation of executive powers, term limits, streamlined committees and greater independence is voted through by its 209 members (no foregone conclusion).
The second is that the most detailed governance overhaul in the world will amount to no more than putting lipstick on a pig if it does not go hand in hand with a wholesale reform of the culture, personnel and practices at the top of world football - including, crucially, at each of the confederations that supply its most senior figures.
On top of that, it is hard to take the promises entirely seriously when they come from the mouth of Issa Hayatou - the Cameroonian acting Fifa president who is a veteran of the bad old days and was recently cited by Blatter as his closest ally in football (despite having stood against him in 2002).
                     Censured by the International Olympic Committee for his part in the ISL scandal, Hayatou recently changed the rules at the Confederation of African Football to allow him to extend his tenure as president to more than three decades. So when in the introduction to February's Congress agenda he promises "a new culture of transparency and accountability that will help to restore Fifa's reputation and change perceptions of our organisation for the better" we can be forgiven for withholding judgment.
Likewise, the parade of five candidates for the next Fifa presidency do not exactly inspire confidence even as a battle for control of the administrative side of the organisation rages amid the power vacuum within Fifa House. Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa, the Bahraini Asian Football Confederation president who is the favourite, remains a target for trenchant criticism from human rights groups for his alleged role in quelling pro-democracy protest in 2011 and recently claimed the US arrests were nothing to do with Fifa but purely an issue for the confederations. Nothing he has said or done thus far inspires confidence his Fifa would be anything other than more of the same with a few licks of paint. How did that song by The Who go again?
As such, it is impossible not to be convinced by those who continue to argue with impeccable logic but seemingly little chance of success that the only sensible course of action is to shut the whole place down and press ahead with an external reform process. Running a sport as globally successful and powerful as football should not be complex, but the internecine internal politics and global power struggles make it so.
And if you thought things were bad at Fifa, the situation in athletics is arguably even more grim. Even the worst that Warner could dream up did not affect the integrity of the sport itself, as the central accusation that senior IAAF officials - including the president, his son and the head of the anti-doping unit - suppressed positive drug tests  of Russian athletes does.
Football gets along very well without a fully functioning Fifa, but athletics is a sport on life support. Sebastian Coe, the British sporting icon who was a vice-president for seven years under Lamine Diack and succeeded him in August, faces a crucial first three months of 2016. The nuances of Lord Coe's message have no chance of getting out while he struggles beneath the growing avalanche of allegations, proven and as yet unproven, submerging his sport.
Even if some of his missteps (paying homage to his now disgraced predecessor Diack, failing to align himself with the brave whistleblowers and investigative reporters who brought the situation to light) could be partially explained away by his electioneering, we are now more than four months on from that moment and the malaise has deepened. Sidetracked by a damaging row over his association with Nike and now having to explain why his right-hand man, Nick Davies, was apparently concocting a plan to combat negative press and massage the release of positive drug tests in 2013 with Papa Massata Diack, the son of the president who is at the heart of many of the most serious allegations, he remains on the back foot. For Coe, it will get worse before it stands any hope of getting better and the jury remains out on whether he is able to sufficiently extricate himself from his complicity in the mess to properly tackle it.
There are also serious structural issues. The World Anti-Doping Agency itself must prove it is fit for purpose - tough regulator rather than purveyor of fluffy educational programmes and PR. And the International Olympic Committee must prove it is not horribly conflicted and compromised itself as the eyes of the world turn to Rio for a Games that was billed in 2009 as a fun packed carnival of sun, sea and sporting excellence.
It has not quite turned out that way. Brazil, mired in an economic slump and facing challenges from ticket sales to sewerage issues in the bay where sailors will compete for medals, has its own issues. Meanwhile, the blazered mandarins of the IOC are battling to reverse a growing tide of public opinion in prospective host cities around the world that the Games are simply not worth the expense and the hassle.
But more than that, as IAAF inspection teams set off for Russia in the early part of January before a decision in March about whether to let them compete in Rio and Dick Pound prepares the release of the explosive second part of his Wada independent report, it will be harder than ever to suspend disbelief. Every two years, broadcasters and sponsors pay billions in the belief that viewers around the world will temporarily disengage from the murkiness surrounding those who govern and sell world sport to gorge on the power of the sporting spectacle and channel the purity of stories of individual heroism from which they draw their power. In Rio, that may prove tougher than ever.
Yet, to end where we began, if there is one aspect of all this that must provide some hope it is that some of those who have arrogantly profited as they have hollowed out global sport over the past three decades have finally, belatedly been brought to book in 2015. That alone is reason to raise a glass to the US Department of Justice, the attorney general Loretta Lynch, the Russian whistleblowers Yulia and Vitaliy Stepanov, the investigative journalist Hajo Seppelt and all those others who got us here.
But the champagne should stay very much on ice until it becomes clear whether the grim catalogue of revelations in 2015 really offers hope of a full stop to a story of four decades of sporting corruption and contagion - or merely signals a pause.

Two New Jersey newspapers denounce Chris Christie's 'abysmal' performance; 
Asbury Park Press and Courier News deride governor's claims of successes in office, pointing to reader survey labelling Republican candidate a failure.

Alan Yuhas in New York.

Two New Jersey newspapers on Saturday called Governor Chris Christie a failure for his state, rejecting the Republican presidential candidate's sales pitch to Americans that he has an accomplished record and sound judgment.
 Related:  US presidential election 2016: the state of the Republican race as the year begins
The editorial boards for sister papers the Asbury Park Press  and the Courier News denounced the governor, joining the Star-Ledger in loudly criticizing Christie and citing residents who consider their governor "a failure across the board".  
"New Jerseyans, it seems, positively hate the job he's doing for the state," the Courier News board wrote. 
Drawing from a survey, the Press graded Christie's performance in the last year. It handed down poor marks in nearly every subject, flunking the governor on the environment, energy, gun control and transparency. He received Ds on the economy and leadership and at best he received a C, regarding the state's recovery from Hurricane Sandy.
"There was once promise," the board wrote, noting Christie's early success on pension reform, but "he had a thoroughly abysmal 2015".
The Press argued that Christie has proven himself a negligent leader, "content to leave New Jersey on autopilot while he campaigns for president" during more than 200 days out of state in 2015. 
Christie has criticized a rival Republican candidate, Marco Rubio, for missing votes in the Senate, saying: " Dude, show up to work and vote no." The Florida senator responded, telling Iowa voters Christie "has been missing in New Jersey half the time".
The Courier News agreed, and called Christie "a disaster on the environment" for taking a settlement from $225m ExxonMobil  over a pollution case. It said he had been "embarrassingly weak on gun control".
The papers also ridiculed Christie for his about-face on President Obama, whose help he welcomed - with an embrace that became infamous on the 2012 election trail - after the devastation of Sandy. 
"Whatever courage may have been involved" in facing up to Republicans over the embrace, the Courier News wrote, "was fleeting at best".
The Courier News also noted the suspicion of corruption and cronyism swirling around Christie's office, underscored by the continuing scandal over a 2013 partial closure of the George Washington Bridge by a politically motivated staffer.
"The governor is widely and rightly seen as a secretive, devious officeholder with a taste for luxury and a thin skin," the board wrote.
The Newark-based Star-Ledger reported extensively on the bridge scandal, and has offered its own scathing review of a governor it has previously endorsed. On Friday the paper published an editorial arguing that Christie " has lost his marbles " for arguing that his unpopularity is a sign of his willingness to make tough decisions.

Christie's approval ratings in New Jersey have plummeted, with only 33% approving of his performance, according to  a Rutgers-Eagleton poll, and 61% want him to abandon his presidential ambitions, according to a Quinnipiac University poll. A Monmouth University poll found in July that 57% of New Jerseyans want Christie to resign.
Nationally, Christie has struggled, ranking sixth in the Republican primary, at 3.7%, according to a HuffPost average of 33 pollsters.
He has performed better in New Hampshire, with 10.8%, and where an influential newspaper endorsed him. The Union-Leader endorsement provoked a spat with the Star-Ledger, which accused the other newspaper's board of ignorance regarding Christie's record.
The Union-Leader has waded into the Republican race in an attempt to boost its preferred candidate, last week publishing a front page editorial attacking the frontrunner, Donald Trump.

Brazil's anti-corruption prosecutor: graft is 'endemic. It has spread like cancer'; 
Deltan Dallagnol, 35, is leading an investigation that has so far charged more than 70 politicians, lobbyists and industrialists, overturning decades of impunity.

Jonathan Watts in Curitiba.

As the lead prosecutor in Brazil's biggest corruption investigation, Deltan Dallagnol had long been aware he was making history, but he only appreciated the case's impact on the country's people when a stranger stopped him in the street to give thanks.
"He said he had cried when he saw the prince of a huge company being arrested because it made him realise the law is being applied equally. He never imagined something like that happening in Brazil," the young lawyer recalled. "A lot of people have put their hopes in us."
There cannot be many graft investigations in the world that prompt tears of gratitude, but for millions of Brazilians, a string of high-profile arrests have been a source of solace in an otherwise dismal year - a sign that some of the country's institutions are functioning effectively, even with the economy suffering its worst crisis in decades and parliament riven by an impeachment struggle. 
The Lava Jato (Car Wash) investigation headed by Dallagnol is, however, partly responsible for the chaos. Overturning decades of impunity, it has charged more than 70 political leaders, lobbyists and captains of industry with bribery, tax evasion or misuse of public funds.  
This has paralysed several industries, adding to the decline of GDP. It has also contributed to a vicious battle in congress, where the speaker of the lower house, Eduardo Cunha, has initiated moves to remove President Dilma Rousseff as a tactic to dodge accusations that he accepted $5m in bribes from the state oil company Petrobras.
Critics say the investigation has gone too far, that it rides roughshod over the law and that a clique of populist justice officials are undermining the authority of elected officials in the government and legislature.
In an interview with the Guardian at his bustling office in Curitiba, Dallagnol says the opposite is true.
"This shows our institutions have been maturing since the constitution was put in place," he said, referring to the immediate post-dictatorship era in the late 1980s when prosecutors, federal police and judges were given more autonomy and power. "The fault is not with investigators but with those who committed corruption. Once they do that, it gives power to legal agents to prosecute them and seek proportionate punishment according to the due process of the law."
The Harvard-trained prosecutor is, at first sight, an unlikely agent for change. A devout Christian, he looks younger than his 35 years. His office is relatively small: just 11 prosecutors and 50 support staff. 
Somewhat awkwardly, they share a building with Petrobras and Odebrecht - two of the companies they are investigating - an arrangement which leads to some painful silences in the elevators, according to one of Dallagnol's aides.
Their base in Curitiba - the capital of Paran· state - is unfashionable, but its distance from the power and wealth in BrasÌlia, S„o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro is also a source of independence and strength. The prosecutors have found an ally in local judge SÈrgio Moro, and worked well with federal police and tax officials, according to Dallagnol. 
"In theory we could have cases like this everywhere in Brazil but it doesn't happen," he said. "Here, there were a lot of necessary conditions. It was a conspiracy of the universe, an alignment of the planets, a God-given opportunity for change."

The results have been startling. The investigation started as an inquiry into a money-laundering operation at a car wash, and has retained the name Lava Jato even as it mushrooms to encompass other illegal activities. 
Since those apparently inconsequential beginnings, it has uncovered nationwide corruption at the state-run oil firm Petrobras, which was being used to channel campaign funds to most of the main political parties. 
The investigation has since widened to include construction companies, Swiss bank accounts, Rolls-Royce and a Dutch offshore drilling platform builder. In the latest twist in the past week, there have been raids on senior members of Brazil's biggest political party, the PMDB and revelations that the graft may extend to Olympic projects.
Those charged so far make up a Who's Who of Brazil's elite. They include the head of Brazil's biggest building firm, Marcelo Odebrecht ; the former head of investment bank BTG Pactual, AndrÈ Esteves ; the head of the senate, Renan Calheiros; the treasurer of the ruling Workers party, Jo„o Vaccari, and dozens of senators and deputies. All deny wrongdoing. Others have been called for questioning, including former president Luiz In·cio Lula da Silva. 
More can be expected. "We have an environment that is corrupt. It's endemic. It has spread like a metastasis of cancer so this case could take us anywhere," says Dallagnol, who says the $6.2bn of corruption uncovered so far is likely to be only the tip of the iceberg.
Asked if he believes anybody in a high position in Brazil is clean, he smiles and then pauses for several seconds, while he chooses a diplomatic answer. "We believe there are good and bad people in any institution."
The key to the investigation's success has been cooperation agreements with suspects, who have been promised reduced sentences in return for handing back bribes and giving testimony against others involved in the case. With the support of Judge Moro, Paran·'s police and prosecutors have persuaded 19 defendants to sign such bargains.
This unsettles some legal experts, who say the police, prosecutors and judges in Curitiba are violating rights in order to secure cooperation agreements. 
Blackstone, a London barristers' chambers hired by Odebrecht's counsel to consider whether Lava Jato meets international standards, has expressed concern that the presumption of innocence and respect for liberty have been overlooked in the investigation.
"If concerns that pre-trial detention is being used as a means to compel a detainee to become a state witness are well-founded such an approach would be inconsistent with international and comparative law norms and would be likely to place Brazil in breach of her obligations in international law," it observed in a report.
Blackstone lawyers argue the high media profile and public statements by justice officials could also prejudice the case.
"There is a real risk of a populist wave leading to safeguards being watered down or jettisoned," says barrister Timothy Otty QC.
The predominantly rightwing media are certainly on the side of the investigators and judge, who frequently appear on the front pages of newspapers and magazines. 
And many ordinary Brazilians now idolise these new "heroes". Judge Moro will be honoured in next year's carnival parade in Olinda, Pernambuco state, with a six-metre high doll. A samba tribute to Newton Ishii - a federal police agent who has been pictured leading away suspects after dawn raids - has gone viral on social media.
For many veteran political reporters, this adulation is understandable: the case has become a force for change in contrast to the politicking and stagnation of the national capital, BrasÌlia.
"We are seeing some of the most powerful men in Brazil go to jail. In the medium term, we're heading for a better place," said Gerson Camarotti, a Globo journalist who has covered politics in Brasilia for 20 years. "At any other time in recent history, there would have been a deal. This scandal would have been investigated in congress and dealt with in congress. But this time, we have a new generation of young prosecutors and judges who don't have political connections. Nobody controls them." 
With that popularity has come more power for the judiciary relative to the legislature. For the first time since the return of democracy in 1985, federal police last month arrested a serving senator - DelcÌdio do Amaral - for trying to pervert the course of the investigation. His detention, which had to be approved by the supreme court and endorsed by the upper house, has prompted hopes that other congressmen who have been charged with crimes may finally face justice.
Silvio Costa, a deputy leader of the house from the government camp, told the Guardian earlier this year that the investigation would lead to the greatest jailing of congressmen in world history. 
He drew parallels with Operation Clean Hands in Italy - where an investigation into state-contract bribery brought down the nation's postwar political system. For Costa, this would be no bad thing. "There have been centuries of sickness since Brazil was founded. Now we have the medication and the personnel to find a cure. The country is going to come out better from this process." 
The Workers party administration claims credit for the change represented by the investigation. 
"This is happening because Lula and Dilma gave a great deal of independence to the public prosecutors and federal police," Edinho Silva, the communications minister, told the Guardian. "I think there are few countries in the world that would give such autonomy to an investigation like this that involves many of the most important leaders in the country."
But how much further the investigation will go remains to be seen. There is already a backlash. The jurisdiction of part of the case has been taken from Curitiba. There are also efforts to drag judicial agents into the political mire. Some on the left accuse prosecutors - some of whom were trained by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation - of collusion in what they see as an attempted coup against Rousseff.
Dallagnol denies political bias in an investigation that has encompassed politicians from almost every party. 
He said he wants the case to stimulate debate and prompt a shift in public ethics. To this end, he has suggested a 10-point anti-corruption plan, which has drawn more than 1.1 million online supporters.
"We know a lot of people put their hopes in us. We know we can't deliver all the changes they want so we propose changes in the law," he said. "This case won't change Brazil, but it can be a lever for society. Society is the main actor, not us."

Simon Danczuk: I won't be dragged through a kangaroo court; 
Rochdale MP said younger women are his achilles heel, and that he expects to be treated the same as any other MP.

Frances Perraudin.

Simon Danczuk has said he will not be "dragged through a kangaroo court" after he was suspended by the Labour party following reports that he sent sexual messages to a teenager.
The MP for Rochdale conceded that he had "been silly" and had previously admitted that he had a drink problem, following a report in the Sun that he had sent explicit texts to 17-year-old Sophena Houlihan after she asked him for a job as a case worker in his constituency office.
"I know I've been silly and I've said I'm extremely sorry, but I'm not going to be dragged through a kangaroo court so my enemies can exact revenge," said Danczuk. "I expect to be treated the same as any other MP." 
Danczuk's comments came after the Sunday Times reported that Labour was preparing to expel him permanently from the party. A source familiar with the inquiry had told the paper that the focus would be on claims that Danczuk abused his position by making sexual references to someone who had asked him for employment.

The MP, who has been a fierce critic of the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, was suspended by his party pending an investigation shortly after the texting allegations were published on New Year's Eve. Further allegations about his private life then followed. 
On Sunday, Danczuk's first wife told the Mail on Sunday that the MP was a sexual predator. Sonia Rossington, who was married to the politician for a decade, accused him of drug-taking and sexually abusive behaviour during their marriage.
Rossington claimed the pair's two teenage children intended to change their surnames following the allegations.
"I'm appalled at his disgusting behaviour with this young woman who is only a few years older than his daughter - but no, not surprised," said Rossington, who divorced Danczuk in 2010. "To be honest, I was waiting for something like this to happen.
"I think this has been his modus operandi for years," she alleged. "He's a sexual predator who made my life hell."
Danczuk responded to Rossington's claims, telling the Mail on Sunday: "She is consumed by bitterness, is susceptible to drinking too much and is telling lies."
The MP declined to comment further on Sunday, but a friend of Danczuk's said: "Some of the allegations [made by the MP's ex-wife] are clearly criminal, but she's never been to the police or anything like that. The Mail wanted a story and I don't think there was much around this weekend... It's been a really unedifying bidding war in which [newspapers have] just been buying up different people." 
He added: "All of this is immaterial and irrelevant in terms of the investigation he faces in the Labour party, because that's not going to focus on anything to do with his ex-girlfriend or his ex-wife or any other kind of tittle tattle."
The MP has been a prominent campaigner against child sexual exploitation and played a leading role in exposing his predecessor as MP for Rochdale, Sir Cyril Smith, as a paedophile.
Danczuk allegedly told Houlihan that he was "horny" and asked her if she wanted spanking. 
The MP later told the Sun on Sunday that an alcohol problem had led him to send the messages and that younger women were his "achilles heel".
A friend of Danczuk's said: "This is clearly a very distasteful episode, but Jeremy Corbyn can't introduce some kind of new moral threshold which only applies to Simon and not any other MP. In terms of parliamentary sex scandals, this isn't even a footnote. He's never met this person."
The besieged MP won some support from Jacqui Smith, who accused the party of prejudging its inquiry into him. She tweeed: "This irresponsible briefing risks bringing [Labour] disciplinary action into disrepute and opening it to challenge." 
The Conservative MPs Stewart Jackson and Michael Fabricant responded to the news of the MP's suspension by tweeting that they suspected Danczuk had been swiftly suspended due to criticism of the Labour leadership. 
Asked earlier this week whether Danczuk's suspension had anything to do with his trenchant opposition to his leadership, Corbyn said the MP had been suspended because of Thursday's media reports and nothing else.
Danczuk had tried to explain his conduct by saying that he liked younger women. "My first wife was 10 years younger than me, my second wife was 17 years younger, my last girlfriend is 17 years younger," Danczuk told the paper. "Some men like older women, some like younger women, some like brunettes, some like blondes.
"I have a drink problem, and that is a major contributory reason why I sent the messages. I've seen a psychiatrist about it and he's told me to stop drinking for six months. I feel awful about what happened. I don't know what came over me."
The MP's former girlfriend and a Labour councillor for Leyland Central told the Sunday Mirror that the MP was "a total embarrassment to Rochdale" and was unfit to be a member of parliament.

Superhouses: the allure of fantasy homes where money is no object; 
As our homes increasingly reflect identity, financial security and status, a new book about some of the world's most striking designs taps into our daydreams ∑ Inside the world's superhouses - in pictures.

Clarissa Sebag-Montefiore.

When Karen McCartney first stumbled across the title Superhouse for her new coffee table book, she worried it might sound a bit "flash, moneyed - vulgar even."
Then again, perhaps that is part of its appeal. Superhouse  is unabashed property porn. Houses are photographed in luscious detail, ranging from the grand tumbledown arches of a restored 16th century English castle to a Seattle home built into a rocky outcrop.
 Related:  Sydney house prices jump 22% in one year to reach $1m median, report says
Most urban professionals in cities like Sydney (where the median house price is 10 times higher than the median income), London and New York are unable to get on the property ladder without help. Let alone live in a house designed with the delicate curves of a butterfly wing, like one Victorian superhouse overlooking the wilds of the Bass Strait.  
So why do Australians - and others - fantasise over these dream homes?
"We are always fascinated with how other people live and particularly the ends of the spectrum," social researcher Dr Rebecca Huntley says. "So it might be with the same interest that we watch [the SBS documentary] Struggle Street  and view some extraordinary house designed by an architect."
Like a designer handbag or a car, our homes give us status and become an outward signal of the rank and standing we wish to project to our peer group.
 But everyone's idea of a dream home is different according to Neale Whitaker, editor-in-chief of Australia's Vogue Living magazine: "My dream house is a spacious warehouse apartment in the inner-city with a roof terrace. I have no desire for a swimming pool, paddock or parking for five cars. Yours might be a waterfront mansion or a country homestead."
Interiors can also be revealing. In The Secrets of the Bedroom, a chapter in Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, Malcolm Gladwell relays a telling experiment. 
Psychologist Samuel Gosling invited strangers to view the dorm rooms of college students. They had 15 minutes to look around and answer a series of questions about who lived there, ranging from how conscientious the occupant was to their emotional stability and openness to new experiences. He then compared their answers to friends of the students who were asked identical questions.
 Related:  'The more deprived and edgy, the better': the two sides of London's property boom
 Surprisingly, the strangers were able to garner more information than the friends simply by looking at the students' bedrooms. They instinctively drew on a mixture of "identity" claims (deliberate declarations of how we'd like to be perceived such as a framed university certificate or photograph with a celebrity) to "behavioural residue", the aspects of personality we inadvertently reveal through our homes; for example a chaotic kitchen or a shoe rack organised in ascending colours. 
"Forget the endless 'getting to know' meetings and lunches, then," Gladwell writes. "If you want to get a good idea of whether I'd make a good employee, drop by my house one day and take a look around."
 "Whether it's right or wrong, it does set an impression," agrees Dylan Farrell, Sydney-based designer/creator of the Hamel+Farrell furniture collection and creative principal at interior designer Thomas Hamel & Associates. "You're telling a story about yourself and the house. This," he says, throwing his hands around the living room of his Sydney terrace house where knotty plant roots are artfully displayed in glass cases opposite Moorish-style art deco mirrors, "is like an instant resume - it's a snapshot of who I am. You're judging me based on what you are seeing here."
It is no surprise, then, that we have a preoccupation with peeping through the keyhole into the lives of others. Television programs such as Renovation Rescue, The Block, and Relocation Relocation are booming, the Financial Times  publishes a weekly At Home interview with a well-known person; interior design magazines are on every newsstand; and Superhouse, an exhibition coinciding with McCartney's book, will soon be on show at the Museum of Sydney.

Similarly anyone can broadcast their homes to others through social media sites like Instagram, Facebook, and Pinterest - often shot in soft muted lighting and flattering filters. We spy and consume, comparing, contrasting, and critiquing as we go.
In a wealthy society such as Australia - a country, as Whitaker puts it, which has a "love affair with real estate" - unspoken competition over our homes is rampant. This is a home owning democracy, says Huntley, and homes make up an integral part of "the great Australian dream."
That dream, as in America, was founded on building a home from the ground up. Both countries were colonised with the promise of vast untapped resources and opportunity to create new lives on new lands (settlers, of course, conveniently ignored the native indigenous populations). 
In the west, the relationship between a room of one's own and how it defines identity remains strong. Yet aspirations differ from culture to culture. In high-density Hong Kong and Tokyo, for example, most families live in cramped apartments and a goal might not be ownership of a large house to entertain in but membership of a coveted social club.
Not here. In Australia, as affluence has increased and families have reduced in size, houses have only gotten bigger, many now endowed with open-plan kitchens, spacious ensuite bathrooms, and media rooms. Australia might be a beach and bush nation in the popular imagination, but in reality it is highly urbanised (nearly 90% of the population inhabit towns and cities). Despite apartments rearing up across inner city areas, most locals aim to live in stand-alone houses in sprawling suburbs. 
Owning a property remains a barometer of success. While the financial crisis hit the British and American housing market hard, Australia didn't suffer a large dip. There remains concern about a housing bubble but, as Huntley points out, "we haven't lost our faith that the money invested in housing is the right investment to make."
 And while it's unlikely that most people will design and build or do-up their dream home, they can incorporate aspects showcased in print media and on reality TV programs.
"People love looking at beautiful things and love to be inspired," says Whitaker. "But they love it even more when the dream presented to them is potentially within their reach. That if they painted their walls a certain shade, changed their dining chairs, bought a new rug or re-tiled the bathroom, their home might just look like the pages of the magazine."
 Related:  Mouldy rentals are no place to raise kids. Why isn't housing a scandal? | Eleanor Robertson
While this means rampant consumption, it also means that design is becoming "less elitist and more democratic", insists Whitaker. "[As] home improvement and renovation becomes within reach of all of us, there is a quest at the top end of the market to create homes that are ever more individual and bespoke."
It was this quest that McCartney taps into for her book, showcasing houses that project a different way of living, something "beyond the everyday", and with a connection to nature, an idea of retreat, a luxury of absence, or a beauty in form. 
 "It wasn't just about grand scale and money," she explains, sipping tea in her Sydney northern beaches house, which is designed by the architect Bruce Rickard. "It became about thought and originality and perspective, that allowed [these houses] to have a richness."
The fantasy of the dream home may well be about securing financial security, showing off our status, splashing money, and marking our identity. Yet the best of the dream homes built - the ones that may last for centuries and will become part of our architectural heritage - are just as much about aesthetics, beauty, and daring design.
The test is whether in future generations these homes will be valued as classics, like English Georgian architecture or the brownstones in New York. Are they passing fashions or will they become integral to the culture of the country? That, after all, is something worth dreaming about.

Jamie Briggs to blame for publication of public servant's photo, says PM; 
Prime minister says former minister's sharing of photograph of woman who complained about his 'inappropriate' behaviour was 'very unfortunate'.

Michael Safi and Daniel Hurst.

Malcolm Turnbull has pinned responsibility to Jamie Briggs for a photograph of the woman who complained about his "inappropriate" behaviour ending up in a major newspaper, saying the former minister had done the wrong thing by sharing the picture with colleagues. 
The prime minister also reaffirmed that Briggs's decision to resign from the frontbench showed he had agreed his conduct at a Hong Kong bar in November had been wrong, in a pointed message to any allies of the former minister who might privately complain he had been treated unfairly. 
Turnbull said on Tuesday the sharing of the photograph of the public servant had been "very unfortunate". 
 Related:  Malcolm Turnbull lashes out at the Australian over reporting of Briggs scandal
"It was not the right thing to do clearly, and I think everyone recognises that, including Mr Briggs," he said.
But he deflected Labor calls for an investigation to determine who had sent the photographs to the Australian newspaper, which published it on Saturday in pixelated form, along with the woman's age, title and details of her career.
"These leaks inquiries tend to come up with very little," he said. "We know the photo was taken on Mr Briggs's phone and he shared it, and he shouldn't have done it, clearly."
The Australian's story at the weekend had included suggestions by unnamed ministers that Briggs's stepping down had set the bar for ministerial propriety "impossibly high". 
The immigration minister, Peter Dutton, was also caught out describing a journalist critical of Briggs's behaviour as a " mad fucking witch ".
But the prime minister said on Tuesday that Briggs had come "to the conclusion that his conduct had been inappropriate, and he resigned, and he was right to do so".
 Related:  Jamie Briggs scandal: politicians are not above the law, Diversity Council says
The Liberal backbencher Sharman Stone said the developments reflected poorly on the attitudes of some of her male colleagues, and reinforced the need to address the under-representation of women in politics.
"The interesting activities of the past number of weeks demonstrate that some of our male colleagues still don't get it in terms of treating all women with respect," she told the ABC on Tuesday. 
"I think the most important fact is that it [the photo] was leaked, that someone didn't see it as important to keep the woman's identity strictly private ... It is just an example of how we've still got a way to go in all parties."
However, the deputy leader of the Nationals, Barnaby Joyce, said he hoped the political culture would not become overly politically correct after the furore over his ministerial colleagues.
"I never want our country to be completely sterile," he told Fairfax Media.
"...I like that Australia is to the point. One of the great things about Australian politics is our informality and directness and I'd hate to lose that, even if there can be faux pas."
Labor has demanded an inquiry into the leak, arguing it was time for Turnbull "to show some leadership, to stand up".
"The prime minister is hoping this matter will just go away over the quiet holiday period, but the behaviour of his ministers and his MPs have ensured that this issue will go on," acting immigration spokesman Matt Thistlethwaite said on Tuesday.
He said because of the way the image was circulated a digital trail would exist for investigators to follow. 
"Clearly Jamie Briggs sent this photo to someone else, so there would be evidence of who he sent the photo to... and then make some inquiries of how it was leaked to the media," he said.
Dutton's text message gaffe also demanded a stronger response, Thistlethwaite said.
"Clearly that's inappropriate behaviour in this day and age and the prime minister needs to explain whether or not he believes it's appropriate," he said.
Turnbull had also criticised the Australian, in a statement on Monday, for publishing details about the public servant who lodged the complaint. 
"Publishing the identity of a complainant in a case like this not only infringes their privacy, it serves actively to discourage other women who are concerned about the conduct of a superior from raising a complaint in the future," he said. 
Briggs has admitted the photo was taken on his phone and was circulated to colleagues before and after the complaint, but he says he did not leak it to the Australian. 
His reproach came after the public sector union criticised the sending of the photo as a "gross breach of privacy".
Briggs told a media conference last week he was leaving his cities portfolio due to "errors in professional judgement" but hoped to one day return to the frontbench.

The Guardian view on the New Year honours: cranky, compromised but still useful; 
Its origins lie in medieval England and it depends on the idea of inherited monarchy. It's time for a fresh start.

Editorial.

It does not seem likely that Barbara Windsor and Lynton Crosby would ever have expected to be members of the same club: the ultimate glamour-girl-turned-national-treasure and the dour-looking Australian political propagandist with a gift for translating a nation's private prejudices into political pledges would, on the face of it, have little to say to one another over a drink. But they are now both appointed to the topmost rank of the Order of the British Empire, Ms Windsor as a dame commander, Mr Crosby as a knight. What a carry on.
 Related:  Reform to honours system long overdue | Letters 
The British honours system can only be understood as the living embodiment of the country's creaky old constitution, an encrusted accumulation of tradition and convenience. There at the top is the small collection of awards that only the Queen can hand out; then come the knights and dames, dusty remnants of a feudal age, followed by carefully ranked honours awarded in the name of a defunct empire. From time to time this curious construct gets a gloss of modernisation, perhaps propelled by a scandal like David Lloyd George's cash-for-honours, and so it survives for another generation, a hierarchical anachronism that is just not quite daft enough, nor used quite crassly enough, to galvanise a popular movement to overthrow it. The honouring of the Tory campaign boss Lynton Crosby, as a reward for his role in the election victory, may be one of the more egregious examples of the uses of patronage, yet it does not seem to be quite outrageous enough to provoke radical reform. More's the pity.
Most countries have ways of honouring distinction (in Sweden, these include diligent reindeer husbandry ), but trying to explain our particular honours system to anyone who did not grow up with it is on a par with introducing them to the rules of cricket. Like human remains exhumed intact from a peat bog, the British honours system is preserved by the environment in which it is embedded. It is based on a medieval king's need to bind in the land-owning classes to royal service through the awarding of ranks as part-reward and part-encouragement. It has lasted because it was flexible; its first significant enhancement came when the rising power of democracy in the first world war and the needs of total mobilisation led to the creation of the Order of the British Empire, a way of recognising the efforts of ordinary people.
Another 50 years passed before, in the 1960s, Harold Wilson's Labour government began a shift away from awards to those who had served the state towards those who made a contribution to the wider public good: this was the era that gave us MBEs for the Beatles. In the 1990s, John Major introduced public nominations; in the New Labour years, teachers, doctors and nurses - people in the public services - became the focus of attention. But at heart it is a system of patronage that the prime minister of the day can use as a kind of public affirmation of what matters to him or her: they can reward the eminently worthy - Dr Michael Jacobs, who was a leading participant in the campaign against Ebola, gets a knighthood, for example - and also the less obviously worthy (there's another ladies' underwear tycoon on the list) alike. And of course they can reward political loyalty and, by omission, punish the disloyal.

It is not chance that the system lingers on and shows no signs of expiring. However tottering a construction of myth and snobbery, its purpose has enduring appeal. There have been some eminent refuseniks - Stephen Hawking, for example, and Vanessa Redgrave, and from an earlier era JB Priestley and even William Gladstone - but only a handful each year reject an honour.
But this is not about individual social advancement, nor some financial reward. It is a way of establishing a kind of league table of national values. Like the conveyor belt in a sushi bar, a thousand names are slowly rolled out for popular judgment. Most are uncontentious. The idea of a British Empire Medal may carry a heavy load of outdated symbolism, but no one would question the virtue of the prime mover of the Stockport All Stars steel band, or the special needs support teacher in Stevenage, or the senior lunchtime supervisor at a primary school in Dewsbury. Many may deplore the power of political patronage and dismiss an honours system that fundamentally rests on hereditary monarchy. Yet a state needs some way of marking out citizens for their virtue. It should be a transparent and publicly legitimised process. But even this flawed system has its uses. It defines what we value, as well as what we don't.

Voters should decide who their MPs are, not newspapers or Twitter; 
Simon Danczuk and Alistair Carmichael have one thing in common: their woes were seized upon by political opponents with scores to settle.

Michael White.

What has Simon Danczuk, the beleaguered Labour text pest, got in common with Alistair Carmichael, Scotland's sole surviving Liberal Democrat MP, who enters the new year in a slightly less beleaguered state? At first glance, not a lot.
Danczuk, the noisy MP for the former Lancashire mill town of Rochdale since 2010 and scourge of Cyril Smith, has gone from hero to zero in the past few days thanks to a series of shameful text messages he exchanged with a teenage job applicant. The row has been rendered more squalid (cries of "enjoyable") by the intervention of ex-wives and other women in his colourful life, some of their indignation revitalised by tabloid revelations.
None of the above applies to the former Scottish secretary and MP for Orkney and Shetland - remote island communities as different from urban Rochdale as they could be - though Pennine grandeur is near at hand. Carmichael's offence, exposed last summer, was to authorise a pre-election leak damaging (it was obviously a brilliant success) to the SNP and then lie about his own role. There is not a single "online dominatrix" in the story.
 Related:  The Guardian view on Alistair Carmichael: he should stay - for now | Editorial 
What links the two sagas (as they surely call scandal in the Northern Isles) and separates them from others is that both have been seized on for wider political purposes by opponents with scores to settle.
It doesn't automatically happen that way. The "Tatler Tory" row, for example, is essentially about internal party management or the lack of it. None of those primarily involved - not even the Conservative party chairman and Cameron pal, Lord Feldman - are elected by voters.
The one player who is an elected MP, Grant Shapps, has resigned his ministerial post. By and large Labour, busy with its own internal squabbles, has sensibly stayed out of it: when a rival party has an internal feud, an external attack can help close ranks.
The same could be said of Lucy Allan, the Tory MP for Telford, who denied allegations of bullying after she was recorded berating her Commons staff for being ill. "You have pissed, pissed around on my life," she told Arianne Plumbly, who wants her former manager to resign.
That's a pretty standard reaction to any misdemeanour these days. Football, politics, business: if resignation calls from individuals and newspapers were all acceded to we would soon run out of anyone in charge above the rank of assistant manager.
In Danczuk's case, he has been suspended by Labour - rightly in my view - while assorted investigations take place. He admits to folly in regard to text exchanges with Sophena Houlihan (then 17) - "no fool like an old fool," as he put it, although he is only 49. But Danczuk categorically denies more serious sexual allegations that have emerged and are now being investigated by Lancashire police.
It's a snake pit in which we should all tread carefully. But there have been demos outside his constituency office ("a ragtag of political opponents" says the MP, as MPs tend to say) while his allies have been quick to suggest that Labour HQ is being hard on Simon because he is an outspoken critic of Jeremy Corbyn's leadership.
This being Britain, there's a class component: Danczuk is a working-class northerner who didn't read PPE at Oxford or work as a ministerial special adviser; he's being picked on, his mates whisper. I can't help but suspect that there may be more to this than meets the eye. Tabloids love using crusading MPs and Danczuk got terrific coverage for his role in finishing off Smith's reputation and highlighting other paedophile cases, not always wisely. But they also love later humbling them as holier-than-thou hypocrites.
We may eventually get to the bottom of it all.
I have a more direct interest in the Carmichael affair, although I barely know the MP and do not recall a single private conversation with him. What caught my attention was what I thought to be the excessive feeding frenzy generated among SNP supporters after a civil service inquiry established that the then cabinet minister had authorised the clumsy leak. It purported to be the summary of a conversation between Nicola Sturgeon and the French ambassador. A Tory win on 7 May would better suit Scottish National party purposes than a Miliband win, the Scottish first minister allegedly said.
That struck me as a statement of the obvious for anyone seeking to break the union of 1707. It still does. But it was indignantly denied. Since Sturgeon strikes me as a more straightforward politician than, say, Alex Salmond, we should accept it. But it didn't end there. A crowdsourced legal campaign to force a byelection in Carmichael's constituency (he survived the 7 May massacre by just over 800 votes) gathered momentum and got its case as far as a high-powered election court (further than I would have expected) in December, before being thrown out.
At the time, I initially thought the outrage to be an example of synthetic zeal (Sturgeon wasn't even a candidate in the election, let alone in Orkney), fuelled by the impassioned 2014 referendum on independence. My critics on Twitter stress that it was not an SNP campaign to oust Carmichael, since the four petitioners were from different parties, but all yes voters, so I am told.
But I came to see it as something more sinister, a further example of intolerance of diversity and political pluralism, localism too, among some partisans of the Holyrood government. Not content with their opponents being left with one seat each at Westminster - the SNP tsunami took 56 out of 59 seats - they wanted Danus Skene, their Etonian candidate in Orkney, to be the 57th.
                      I wrote this column and later dragged myself into a TV studio late at night to cross swords with Leslie Riddoch, the SNP campaigner and writer.
Not my most brilliant performance, I sound tired and I mispronounced the Holyrood parliament - a serious offence for an Englishman. What surprised me was the scale of abuse that descended on my head, courtesy of Twitter. My unfashionable moustache was a particular target and remains so to this day. Rampant moustachism!
I shouldn't have been surprised. People who stick their heads above the parapet, such as JK Rowling, the writer and philanthropist who lives in Scotland and defends the union, get far worse. We now follow each other on Twitter. Since the lost court case, the trolls have gone quiet, despite jeering when I suggested that it would all be over by Christmas.
I stand by my view that voters, not courts, newspapers, disgruntled former staff, internal party rivals or Twitter frenzies, should decide who their MP should be, unless the MP has broken the criminal law in a serious way, as the 2015 Recall of MPs Act now cautiously provides for.
That goes for Carmichael, Danczuk, Allan and all the other politicians who fall from grace in varying ways in this and every parliament. Carmichael's conduct is also being investigated by the parliamentary standards commissioner, though I am not holding my breath. That's as it should be: due process, not lynch mobs.
It so happens that since I wrote that column in May, three SNP MPs - that's quite a high strike rate out of 56 - have been drawn into financial controversy, two suspended, one defended by the party. Whoops, no. As of Tuesday morning, make that four. 
It was bound to happen, it always does. MPs who represent their constituents also represent their human frailties. But let's not treat them unfairly just because they are politicians. Believe it or not, nowadays it can happen. They deserve no better treatment than the rest of us - and no worse.

The first person in history to successfully navigate through the nervous 990s; 
Pranav Dhanawade, the 15-year-old son of a rickshaw driver, has shattered a 117-year-old record that was not there to be beaten so much as marvelled at.

THE BOY BATSMAN & THE BIGGEST INNINGS IN HISTORY
To Mumbai, then, as word spreads that one of the oldest records in cricket has not only been broken, but split, shattered and smashed. In June 1899 AEJ Collins, aged 13, scored 628 not out in a junior house match at Clifton College, the highest score ever made in a competitive game of cricket. The year Collins started at Clifton, one of the school's old boys, Henry Newbolt, published his famous poem Vitai Lampada. "Play up! play up! And play the game!" Seems Collins took the line a touch too literally. He won the toss, put his own team in, and then batted for the next four afternoons. By the time Collins was done, he was the most famous schoolboy in the country. "Today all men speak of him," ran one of the many contemporary newspaper reports. "He will be immortalised in the cricket guides; and his name will shine out conspicuously in the lists of records."

And so he was. Each year ever since, Collins has had a little corner of the Wisden Almanack all to himself: Miscellaneous Records, Minor Cricket, Highest Individual Scores. In 117 years, no one has even passed 600, let alone come close to his 628. Like Bradman's batting average, Collins's record was not there to be beaten so much as marvelled at, a vast and an inexplicable stone monolith of a score that left us moderns wondering how on earth the ancients did it. Until now.
On Monday KC Gandhi English high school began their match against Arya Gurukul school in the third round of the HT Bhandari Inter School U16 Trophy. Arya Gurukul batted first, and were dismissed for 31 in 20 overs. Hard luck, as the old salts say, these things can happen. Especially since most of Arya Gurukul's players were actually from the U14 team, because their principal had refused to release their regular players while they were revising for their exams. Seldom can schoolboy cricketers have been so happy to sit out a match.
Opening the batting for KC Gandhi, Pranav Dhanawade, the 15-year-old son of an auto rickshaw driver. In his two previous innings Dhanawade had been dismissed in the 80s, something he was particularly sore about since his coach Mubin Shaikh had told him that he needed to make a really massive score to break into the Mumbai U16 team. Before the match Dhanawade promised Sheikh that he would score a century. By lunch he had made 45. The ground was small, and the bowling weak. Dhanawade says he has "always been a big-hitter", and that he "just played my natural game, which is to attack from the word go".
So the fours and sixes kept coming. Some struck so hard, that, according to the opposition coach, his players just "could not put hand to the ball". The 45 became a century, which became a double, which became a triple. It was at this point, Dhanawade says, that he started to think about breaking records. Not Collins's, set so long ago, but rather those of his own heroes.
Fans follow Mumbai school cricket because its playing fields are also the skies in which new stars arrive. In the last five years, three men have made the headlines around the world with monumental scores in school matches. First there was Sarfaraz Khan, who made 439, then Armaan Jaffer, 498, and finally Prithvi Shaw, 546. These three are - or were - the most-talked about teenage cricketers in India today. Khan and Jaffer are both part of India's squad for the U19 World Cup. Shaw, who has signed up with Sunil Gavaskar's management company and already spent some time in the Yorkshire Leagues, is playing for Mumbai U19s. "I had heard about the three and how they made it to the history books," Dhanawade said. And so these were targets he ticked off, one by one.
First Khan, then Jaffer, and then Shaw. Along the way, he also passed CJ Eady's 566 for Break-o'-Day against Wellington at Hobart in 1901, the second highest score in history. Finally, long into the last session of the day, Dhanawade became the second man in history to score a sextuple-century. Soon after, he became the first to pass Collins's 628. At stumps, he had 652, from 199 balls, with 78 fours, and 30 sixes. Dhanawade had made 607 runs in two sessions. He put on 546 for the first wicket, his fellow opener, Aakash Singh, scoring 173, and then 410 for the second, No3 batsman Siddhesh Patil making an even 100. Overnight, then, KC Gandhi were 956 for one, a lead of 925.
It seems that at first, no one was quite sure what Dhanawade had done. Early reports suggested that he had broken the records for the most runs scored in a day, and the most runs in a Mumbai school match. It was only later, when news started to flicker around Twitter, that it became clear he had just made the biggest score in the history of the sport. That night Dhanawade travelled to his coach's house, where he and his father met the press. "Pranav is getting non-stop calls from the media and relatives," his father said. "He has not even got the time to talk to his mother. She is keenly waiting for him to return home."
Pranav was already thinking about the next day's play. Asked whether he felt he could score 1,000, he replied: "Why not? I am confident that I can do it. I will definitely try to score 1,000 runs as I am just 350 away. If I can score 600 runs in two sessions, I am confident of scoring 350 in one session." He didn't quite do it. At lunch on day two, his score was 921. Finally, at around 3pm on Tuesday afternoon, Dhanawade raised his 1,000, having become the first person in history to successfully navigate his way through the nervous 990s. KC Gandhi eventually declared with their score on 1,465 for three. Dhanawade's contribution was 1,009 not out, from 327 balls, with 59 sixes and 129 fours, in six hours and 35 minutes.
We should spare a thought, at this point, for those unsung heroes, Arya Gurukul's bowlers, since if it were not for their unstinting efforts, none of this would have been possible.
Sarth Salunke, 20 overs, none for 284.
Pratik Bedekar, 18 overs, none for 241.
Harshal Jadhav, 18 overs, one for 281.
Mayank Gupta, two overs, none for 37.
Swaraj Deshmukh, five overs, none for 80.
Aditya Solanki, two overs, none for 33.
Tejas Missar six overs, none for 142 - figures which, without wishing to be cruel, do rather make you wonder what the skipper was thinking when he decided Missar had a sixth over in him.
And finally, a special prize, surely, for Ayush Dubey, who bowled 23 overs and took two for 352.
As for Dhanawade, he says he hopes to one day play in the Ranji Trophy. Collins never actually played a the first-class game. He joined the army instead. Whether Dhanawade makes it or not, cricket lovers will always remember his name, up there, now and ever after, above Collins's in the record books.

QUOTE OF THE WEEK
"Cricket is ultimately a joyous/torturous shared experience around which to bond a group of mates, and as much as we enjoyed watching him with ball in hand, we value more the time spent with him on and off the field. A big, ever smiling, ever joyful young lad, the very definition of popular, he was always a delight to be around. Even with his career going from strength to strength he always had time for us all. That we will not see how far his talent will take him is a heartbreaking injustice. That no one will get to spend time with Matt again is too awful for words."
A tribute, from Preston Nomads to their former player Matthew Hobden, who died last week, aged 22. Police say his death is "unexplained", but that it is not being treated as suspicious. Cricketers' obituaries always include their career statistics, as a mark of their achievements in the game. In Hobden's case their scantiness tells its own sad story. He played 18 first class games for Sussex and Cardiff MCCU, and took 48 wickets at 39 in them. But he was selected for the England Performance Programme in both 2014-15 and 2015-16, and the head coach Kevin Shine has said that he was "certain" Hobden would have gone on to play for England.

LODHA LIGHTS THE WAY AHEAD
Intriguing developments in India, where a committee appointed by the Supreme Court has recommended several radical changes to both the BCCI and the wider running of the game. The committee, chaired by retired Chief Justice RM Lodha, was formed in January 2015, in the wake of the IPL spot-fixing scandal. They have suggested that from now on BCCI Board members will only be able to serve limited terms in office, that ministers, bureaucrats and officials serving with state associations will be barred from membership, and that three independent officials will be appointed to oversee elections and rule on conflicts of interest. They have also recommended the formation of an Indian players union. It is, in short, a manifesto for good governance. Unsurprisingly, the BCCI have already been questioning the authority of the report, and a spokesman has suggested that it may not be binding.
More significant still, the committee proposed that gambling on cricket should be legalised in India, a step that would allow the authorities to regulate the bookmakers, and kill the black market. Many experts, among them the former ICC president Ehsan Mani, believe that the legalization of gambling in India is the first, and most essential step, towards tackling the issue of spot-fixing in cricket. "I'm a strong advocate of legalising betting in India and bringing it under control of regulatory authorities so that the conduct of bookies can be monitored properly," Mani said in 2012. "You'll find that the risk of corrupting players around the world will reduce significantly."

 So the wait for Alastair Cook's first home Ashes hundred goes on.  
What a way to go - to part-time leg-spin, just 13 balls before the close. Whether he was motivated by that milestone or the prospect of tomorrow's rain, he played a near-perfect hand, just as he did at Lord's.

Bit of late movement into Cook from Starc, but he's been in long enough to go with it and gets a single into the leg side. Signs of Buttler giving in to temptation as he plays and miss at another full ball outside off stump. A fine-tickle races away to the boundary, only for Marsh to make a good diving stop and throw into Nevill from on his knees. The OCS stand behind him offer a round of applause.

 74th over: England 187-5 (Cook 80, Buttler 22) 
Another cut, another single to Cook. Buttler gets one that bounces a bit but he follows the path of the ball well to ensure he turns it well behind bat-pad. The final ball of the over takes a similar path and Buttler just wears it.

 73rd over: England 186-5 (Buttler 22, Cook 79) 
Two for Buttler at the start of this Starc over, as he watches an inswinger right onto he middle of his bat and pushes it through the leg-side. Another couple around the corner as Starc strays onto leg-stump. Maybe his luck is turning: an edge then falls well short of Michael Clarke in the slips. Lyon back on...

Wider next time - wided for four,  actually - as the ball swings past the batsman and in front of first slip, bouncing short and running away to the boundary.

Starc's over the wicket to Cook. Field suggests it's just going to be full and quick. Still, Cook finds a single to long-leg. He might have more luck with Buttler, who's displayed a big a gate as any between bat and pad this series. However, just as I type that, he is right forward with and defending back past Starc for a couple.

Mitchell Marsh comes on to give Lyon a bit of a break and is on the money straightaway. Buttler's in leaving mood but has to play at a couple that come for his stumps. Mitchell Starc replaces Johnson at the other end...

Johnson gets to have a decent go at Buttler and seems to be making it count: averaging 88mph in this particular set, he takes a couple away from Buttler before tailing one in which is left safely, as it happens. Straighter and Buttler has two into mid-wicket. Great comeback from Johnson - 89mph - and lifting to beat Buttler on the outside edge. Thick inside edge gives Buttler another run to keep the strike.

Cook's beaten on his outside edge by a big turner from Lyon. But he follows it by beating the sweeper at deep point by waiting on the back foot and forcing this particular cut shot straighter for four.  Big cheers from the crowd, who are subsisting on a gentle hum with 45 minutes of play left.

 67th over: England 167-5 (Cook 74, Buttler 13) 
The first sign of a bit of restlessness from the England skipper as he tries to force a pull to a short-ball that doesn't get up as much as he expected. Any extravagant bounce seems to have gone from this pitch so it's probably all on Lyon to finish this off ASAP. Just one off the over, to Cook.

 66th over: England 166-5 (Cook 73, Buttler 13) 
Cook's wagon wheel pops up and it's a thing of beauty. Nothing down the ground or behind him. Streams through cover point, one full toss through midwicket. The first four balls from Lyon are dots, the fifth punched through cover point for a single.

Johnson on for Siddle as Warne spends the first part of the over - a dot, single for Cook and a leave outside off - to spy on Aleem Dar in the hope he does another little jig. He does, but only to remove some debris from the crease so that he can make out the crease. Three more dots and he finally stops talking.

Lyon around the wicket to Cook, who uses Aleem Dar as a shield to get a single. He punches off the back foot and Dar, who can't bothered to do square leg to square leg for the right and left handers, neatly back peddles to ensure David Warner can't do the fielding from gully.

 63rd over:  England 163-5 (Cook 70, Buttler 13)  Buttler is hit on the pad, falling over a very full delivery from Siddle that would just have gone down the leg side.  Australia's LBW shout was caught in the throat. That's it from me; Vish will keep you abreast of events for the last hour.
"Hiya, Rob, you can tell Mike Collier that there's a really excellent Sisters of Mercy site out there which has transcribed an interview that sounds like the one he recalls. Nothing on Brearley I could see, but his 'inability to wield a cricket bat' is mentioned."

 62nd over:  England 163-5 (Cook 70, Buttler 13)  Cook is playing a different game to the other batsmen, stockpiling runs with almost complete comfort. I can't remember his last false stroke. There are no guarantees in this thing of ours, but at the moment he looks like he's on the way to his first Ashes hundred at home.  
 " Mike Collier's interesting reminiscence is, like most narratives, constructed around gaps," says Ian Copestake. "In his case the key gap is the now forgotten phrase, 'Here, Mike, have a toke on this'."

 59th over:  England 158-5 (Cook 69, Buttler 9)  Siddle is back, and you'd fancy him to home in on Buttler's outside edge. For the time being he is bowling to Cook. Bowling dry x batting time = four dot balls, and then Cook works two off the pads.
"Off topic, but this has been gnawing away at me for 25 years+ and with Ashes drawing to a close this could be my last chance," says Mike Collier. "Around 1988/9 I recall seeing an article in Melody Maker (or possibly NME) in which indie darlings of the day named their heroes. In amongst them was Andrew Eldritch of The Sisters of Mercy who named Mike Brearley as his hero. The phrases "philosopher king of English cricket" and "my own inability to wield the willow" remain indelibly etched on my memory. Only trouble is no-one I have ever met recalls seeing the same thing and I am starting to wonder if I dreamed the whole thing. It does sound unlikely, I admit. If just one person out there in OBO land can confirm this peculiar homage I will sleep easy for the next 25 years."

"Batting time is one of the most wonderful things about Test cricket for me, and I was so enjoying the Cook led engagement with that most abstract of values," says Ian Copestake. "Now I fear he will have no partners to dance with him in the floating ether of time's seductive rhythms." Ah, but if that's the case it would mean the sight of something even more beautiful: someone carrying the bat. The last Englishman to do so was Mike Atherton in 1997.

 56th over: England 149-5 (Cook 66, Buttler 3)  Cook, who is playing beautifully, clips Lyon through midwicket for four to move to 66. He has never made an Ashes hundred at home. This is a good spot from Mikey Holding on Sky - Bairstow should have been given not out, because it hit the grille of Voges's helmet. Bizarrely, that also happened to Bairstow in India in 2012-13 ; again he was given out when it should have been called a dead ball because it hit Gautam Gambhir's helmet. What a strange coincidence.
"Whether it's Old Brand of Cricket or New Brand of Cricket or New Brand of Old Cricket, every team needs to pick a Brand of Cricket and stick to it," says Mac Millings.

That way, like I say to Mrs. Millings every time I'm about to receive my one birthday treat, 'It may not be pretty, and it may be unsatisfactory, but at least you know what you're getting.'

With some players you might worry whether they have been found out but Buttler, surely, is just too good not to make it at Test level. He could do with a score, though. He almost gets a score of nought when Starc swings a jaffa between bat and pad and just over the stumps.

 45th over: England 125-3 (Cook 55, Bairstow 21)  Siddle zips a length delivery past the outside edge of Bairstow, who snaps his head round to follow the ball in a manner that usually suggests an edge. Not this time. A maiden from Siddle, who has the kind of figures usually seen next to the name C. E. L. Ambrose: 11-7-7-1.
 " I know his season has been average, but is there no chance of Compton going on tour?" says Tom Bowtell. "He was proper gutsy in India, and he and Cook are still one of the most prolific opening pairs in the last 3 years (and he brought out good form in Cook who averages 54 odd batting with him)." I agree, I'd be very tempted to go with him or Carberry in the short term, with a view to Hales coming in over the next 12-18 months. But I doubt it'll happen. If Hales has a good ODI series against Australia I suspect they will pick him in the Test squad to play Pakistan.

 44th over: England 125-3 (Cook 55, Bairstow 21)  Nathan Lyon starts the evening session. He is bowling to Cook, who needs 46 to equal Kumar Sangakkara's record for most centuries in the second innings of a Test. Make that 45, after a cut for one. That shot has got Cook in trouble against Lyon in the past, and this one was in the air for a while.

 Hello, Rob here, on a dark day for those whose name ends in -yth. We have a longish evening session to come, with 36 overs still to bowl. England are 209 behind but still have a chance of saving this game. Their two main hopes are Alastair Cook and the little rain symbol evident on most weather forecasts for tomorrow and Monday.

Finally, some intent. Marsh is still doing his job, but Cook has managed to thread a couple of drives through the cover field, both for four.  Clarke applauds Marsh's persistence with the full ball. Naturally, he finishes with a short ball that Cook thumps through extra-cover for four.

Slack from Bell as he pulls firmly but uppishly to Chris Rogers, diving to his right, who's unable to take what would have been a very good catch. There's a slight delay as Rogers is forced to leave the field and it works in Marsh's favour, as he hits the pitch hard to sting the fingers of Bell and send him on his way. A modest series comes to the end for England's most lavish accessory. Immediately Marsh is at Root, beating the outside edge.

More indecision from Bell on his off-stump. He gets four, but he won't like it: attempting to retract his bat and offering up the face for the ball to kiss off and run through a vacant gully for four.  Clarke's doing well to ensure Bell is stuck on strike, with two on the leg side to stop that dab into that region. Marsh toys with his position at the crease and finishes tight to the stumps, as Bell creams one, finally, but straight to the man at cover.

Mitchell Marsh replacing Nathan Lyon and he squares Bell up, just missing the edge and off stump. Bell then flashes at a drive ball that he edges high through to Clarke... who shells it! It was fast but he's taken those this series. Seemed to react late, throwing his hands up so quickly that he took himself off his feet. It's no great pace, just some low 80s, dandy seam stuff. But he's keeping Bell in check. Just a two, mid-over, past point from the over.

One shorter and across him - 88.2mph - and the next ball is deflected through to Voges, low at first slip.

 17th over: England 31-1 (Cook 11, Bell 0) Siddle finally concedes a run, from his 35th delivery. Nothing else happens, and that's lunch!
"So you don't think Hales is capable of dealing with the harder series then, Rob?" says Michael Drinkwater. " That's not much of a recommendation, is it? Surely if he is good enough, he should be tried now. Reckon he'd be a good person to have in South Africa. As for the dilemma that is Moeen, for a start this series he should have been ahead of Buttler, but his bowling - or his control anyway, seems to have gone in reverse. He should be in the UAE though and so should Rashid. If its just one series, and the selectors want to squeeze in Rashid too, then why not open with Bell and have Moeen at 3?" 
Has Bell ever opened in first-class cricket? I'd rather make one change than two, personally. Hales might be fine, but the combination of a really tough winter, and how good he could be if he cracks Test cricket, means I would ease him in in the gentlest circumstances possible. Giving a player his debut at the wrong time can set in motion a series of events that ultimately ruin that player's Test career: Ravi Bopara is a great example of that. At the moment I'm not sure anyone - not even Hales - knows whether he will crack it at Test level or not.

 14th over: England 26-1 (Cook 11, Bell 0)  Cook cuts another boundary when Lyon drops short. So, who would you open with this winter? I would leave Hales until next summer, because it's such a tricky winter and it could finish him before he has started. Moeen in the UAE is an option, though not in South Africa. They could almost do with a short-term patsy to do the hard work this winter and then allow Hales to come in when it's theoretically easier next summer. The other problem with Moeen opening in the UAE is that he's such a good player of spin, so why take him out of the middle order? It's a big problem; I've no idea what they should do.

 9th over: England 19-0 (Lyth 10, Cook 4)  Siddle beats Lyth with a beauty that pitches outside leg and jags past the outside edge. There's a break in play while Siddle changes his shoes. "Is that one of them Fokkers?" says Bumble as a plane flies over the ground. Another maiden, the fifth of the innings.
"I dont think Moeen is an opener either," says Phil White. "But he is wasted at 8. On Ashes form he should be in the top six. A positive approach to this match would have been to drop Buttler, put Bairstow at 7, and bring in Rashid at 8. Arguably a stronger batting line-up, and who knows what Rashid's bowling might have achieved?" 
I reckon dropping Buttler would have been daft. No point risking the damage to his confidence, not with such a rare talent. It would have been nice to get Rashid in, though. Moeen is too good to bat No8 but I'm not certain he's a Test No6. England have three No 6.5s, for want of a less pretentious phrase.
It is a bit of an odd situation, though, picking a No8 whose strongest suit is his batting. I suspect it'll come to a head over the winter, though goodness knows who might replace him. Rashid won't make it. Monty's situation is worth keeping an eye on. He's still the best spinner in England by a decent distance.

"Would suggest Moeen is different class to Peter Taylor, and it has been seriously proposed that he should open, in the UAE," says Phil White. "(This should ensure Lyth now gets his hundred.)" Oh I agree, I just meant the tactic of putting someone straight back in when you follow on because they batted well in the first innings.

Giles 2005: 155 runs at 19.37, 10 wickets at 57.8 Swann 2009: 249 @ 35.57 and 14 @ 40.50 Swann 2013: 126 @ 25.20 and 26 @ 29.03 Moeen 2015: 250 @ 41.66 and 12 wickets @ 45.50."
That's a good spot. I'm surprised Swann's figures were so modest in 2009, though I suppose Cardiff did a lot of damage. I do think those figures flatter Moeen though; he hasn't bowled anywhere near as well as he did against India last summer.

 WICKET! England 149 all out (Moeen Ali c Nevill b Johnson 30)  
Mitchell Johnson finishes the innings with two wickets in two balls. Moeen feels indeterminately outside off stump and edges low to Nevill. England are 332 behind, and Australia have enforced the follow on. That's the first time Michael Clarke has done so in a Test, and it might just be the last.

 48th over: England 149-8 (Ali 30, Wood 24)  Lyon replaces Siddle. I used to think he was the most underrated player in world cricket, but I reckon he falls foul of the Denis Irwin rule: once a certain percentage of people say you are underrated, you are no longer underrated. Moeen Ali plays him better and more aggressively than most England players, and drives smoothly over mid-on for four to bring up the fifty partnership. The next ball is clouted disdainfully back over Lyon's head for a one-bounce four. England have hit seven boundaries in the last three overs. It's a whole new brand of cricket!

The runs are starting to come quickly now, with Wood hitting consecutive boundaries off Marsh. The first was a forcing shot past backward point, the second a storming cut stroke. 
"My friend Mel is there today (I'm in Leeds, what was I thinking?) as I chose day five instead," says Guy Hornsby. "I'm looking about as foolish as Finn did yesterday when Steve Smith nicked it.

 45th over: England 121-8 (Ali 10, Wood 16)  One Mitchell replaces another, Marsh coming on for Starc. He looks a really good fifth bowler; as Nasser Hussain on Sky, a lot better than most of us thought he was. After an era of six batsmen, a keeper and four bowlers, the fifth bowlers is having a bit of a renaissance, perhaps a consequence of the workload on the main bowlers these days. If Marsh looks a good fifth bowler, then Wood looks a seriously good No10 batsman; he punches another lovely drive for four, this time through mid-off. 
"If Australia can win this Test, then in these last three Ashes series that have been played in an almost back-to-back fashion, it will give Australia an aggregate victory of 7-6 - despite the fact that 10 of the 15 matches were played in England. Despite not retaining the ashes at the end of this series, I consider that a moral victory and is perhaps the best indicator of which team is stronger. Agree or disagree?" It's a no from me. Mind you it's interesting that, although England have won five of the last seven Ashes series, Australia have won more Tests in that time: 14-13.

 44th over: England 117-8 (Ali 10, Wood 12)  Wood is averaging 40 with the bat in this series, second only to Joe Root among Englishmen.

I'm not sure anyone in world cricket has a higher jaffa-ratio than Starc, though mercifully for batsmen he bowls a fair bit of filth as well. Such as a very wide half-volley that Wood can't quite reach with a flail outside off stump. You would expect Starc to tighten up as he plays more Test cricket, and heaven help everyone when he does. Wood gets the first runs off the bat this morning with a flowing cover drive for four. Shot!

The bad news for England is that it's swinging - or, as David Brent might say, I think there's been some shape out there! The first ball is an inswinger that deflects off Mark Wood's left leg for four leg-byes. Wood does well to clear his feet and dig out a yorker before being beaten by three consecutive deliveries outside off stump. This won't take long.

There is some talk that Michael Clarke will not enforce the follow on so that he can bat again. In fact he might not want another innings; when a man is weary he just wants to sleep. Either way, he'll surely do what's best for the team. In a post-Kolkata world that normally means batting again, but because this is a dead game I suspect the let's-get-this-done vibe will override any fear of losing the match. There's a forecast for rain tomorrow as well. So I reckon Clarke will do the right thing and enforce the follow on to ensure I get a day off tomorrow.

He was probably Australia's second greatest opener, after Victor Trumper, and was the leading scorer when the Invincibles hammered England 4-0 in 1948. In the final Test, at the Oval, he played an innings that was completely overshadowed by Donald Bradman's duck. "I was there," Morris would say when the subject of Bradman's final innings came up. "Oh, did you play?" someone would ask. "Yes, I got 196."

 Preamble  
Morning. The 2015 Ashes would have tested even Kipling's equilibrium. Triumph and disaster aren't impostors; they're the only friends we've got, the only friends who can help us process this unnervingly weird Ashes. Usually such knee-jerkism is the preserve of the risible football, but this series has been so daft as to make extreme reactions almost irresistible. 
So it is that, on Thursday morning, England were an intrepid bunch of rare talents embarking on a journey towards world domination; today they are a flaky bunch of underachieving talents who can only win on doctored greentops. You don't need me to tell you that the truth is somewhere inbetween, so that's precisely what I'm going to do: the truth is somewhere inbetween.
It's hard to know how to feel about last night, when England - as only they can - contrived to rain on their own parade. In one sense it doesn't matter; in another it means more than a dead rubber normally would. If the rest of the match plays out as you would expect, and England are hammered, it will change how history records this Ashes series. It will also change how many perceive the England team and, perhaps, how they perceive themselves. 
At the moment, old-fashioned Scoreboard Pressure is Kryptonite to England's hip young hero, Brand Of Cricket, so they need to develop the confidence and method to score runs when they are batting second and the opposition have posted something a bit more challenging than 60 all out, especially with Pakistan and South Africa to play this winter. The best place to start is now, by getting 400 second time round and securing a vaguely honourable eight-wicket defeat. (Or a 150-run defeat if Michael Clarke doesn't enforce the follow-on.) 
England will resume on 107 for eight, a deficit of 374. The glittering prize of averting embarrassment, and being able to look people in the eye when the urn is lifted, can be still be claimed. But with the way this series has gone, they will probably get bowled out for 59 in their second innings.

Mailk's trying to do his best Saeed Ajmal impression by holding his action at the crease and trying to put the batsman's timing off. But Malik isn't Ajmal - even Ajmal isn't Ajmal anymore - and Root just waits a little bit longer before threading him through extra cover for four.

 Andrew Grant has e-mailed in with an interesting (and surely unique) topic for OBO discussion... 
"A discussion I had with my Mrs last night was what would I want in exchange for the pain of going through chidlbirth- my initial answer was £250k. 
"She also gave me the hypothetical option of the ability to consistantly make hundreds - say three or four per season- at club level in exchange to experiencing the pain of childbirth. 
"Now I drive a hard bargain and the need for consistent runs and bowling second wickets in the Old Actonian's 4th XI led me to suggest that I would exchange the pain of childbirth for the ability to make 800 runs and 40 wickets per season consistently (as a genuine all rounder).
"What level of talent would the male OBO readers demand in exchange for having to go through childbirth? Brief international career? Solid county pro? One Career century at any level?"

Brilliant shot to end the over from Cook. Yasir gives it some flight so Cook gets out the slog sweep. Despite it being a straight delivery, he reads it perfectly, going down to up over mid wicket for a one-bounce four. Slayed a few Aussie spinners with that one in the 2010-11 Ashes.

Cracking shot from Root - a big stride out to Shah allows him to meet the ball before it pitches which he works through midwicket for four.

Cook tries to reverse-sweep Yasir, leading to an excited shout as the ball loops into the air, which lasts only as long as it takes to realise there's nobody anywhere near catching it, and that it didn't hit his bat anyway. Then there's an lbw shout against Root, but the umpire's unimpressed and the ball was surely clearing the stumps.

In which Paul Reiffel shows off his no-ball-calling skills by making a couple of close calls, one of which was almost certainly not a no ball at all. It's longer than it should have been but it's very far from a bad over, Wahab making Joe Root's life distinctly uncomfortable with a couple of roaring short balls, though he scores a single off one and four off another, top-edged very nearly for six. Cook in between essays a very lovely pull stroke, which earns him one run and a bit of appreciative purring.

Phwoar! Cook expunges all memory of his nearly-but-not-quite getting out the previous over with a Michelin-starred cover drive for four.

Oooh! Cook pulls the ball just past Masood, who had been stationed at backward square for precisely this moment. He gets a run, and Pakistan get the minor morale boost of seeing their trap being blundered into, even if it didn't actually trap anything. "Sadly, I can't watch or listen today and find myself in the odd position of actually missing David Lloyd's voice," writes Robert Wilson. "Particularly disturbing since, during the last Test, I forced a top-notch, English-speaking French intellectual (they still exist) to listen to five minutes of Bumble's rambling commentary. She understood not one single solitary word but found it all intensely lyrical, like a pigeon reciting Shakespeare. She then asked me - no word of a lie - if he was good looking !

Cook starts the over with England's first boundary, clipped off his thigh to deep square leg. Wahab is bowling at around the 90mph mark, fast enough to make life uncomfortable and, more specifically, to make Bell uncomfortable as the fifth delivery zips across him and he briefly looks to wave his bat at it inadvisably.

Four slips - three, a gap and then one - and a short leg in place at the start of the innings. Bell gets a couple of early runs and then sees out the remainder of the over without further scorage, looking uncomfortable only when making a last-moment decision to withdraw the bat as the fifth delivery passed six inches wide of off stump.
block-time published-time 10.35am BST 
 2nd over: England 6-1 (Cook 2, Bell 1) 
To be fair, it was a sharp catch from Shan Masood. But to be equally fair, he didn't have to move his hands, just cup them and start celebrating. Given how close he was to the bat, had the ball gone so much as six inches either side it would have been almost uncatchable. Thing is, it didn't.

As expected, Shafiq is turning down singles. Though that might be more down to the face that Mark Wood is the bowler. A searing yorker nearly knocks Shafiq off his feet.

Ahmed fends one down to give Shafiq the strike. A bit of luck comes his way as he tries to play in front of the wicket but gets a thick inside edge that scuttles just in front of his stumps to Moeen Ali at square leg. Wood's line to him has been good.

Mark Wood is yer man from the other end: he's starting wide on the crease to Shafiq who is on the cusp of a 20th Test score of fifty or more. Shafiq, younger and thusly more nimble than Misbah, is able to get a proper dip on his ducks. Wood's bouncers pass harmlessly over his hunched back.

A short-leg, Superman at bat-pad and a man on the hook (a slip, too) as Stuart Broad gets the day going. We only have to wait a ball for some short stuff. Misbah ducks under the first but can't sort himself quickly enough so wears the next one on the top hand. A couple more and he's trapped in front by a full ball which nips away from Misbah slightly. The captain reviews but soon he's moving off without scoring. Sarfraz Ahmed comes to the crease.

 Morning everyone. 
Vish here, coming live and direct from London town, bringing you all the goings on in Dubai. Glory to Misbah, who ended his latest slow-cooked masterpiece with a 15-run bang in the fading light to reach his ninth Test century. 
Doesn't seem much, does it? Still, he's joint-top on the list of most hundreds scored by a Pakistan captain (he's got seven and so does Inzamam-ul-Haq). Even as he carted Moeen Ali into the stands for one of his two last over sixes, I still had England bowling Pakistan out by lunch today. A night's sleep has changed my view - that's generally the way it tends to go - and now I wonder if England will be stuck in on the hosts' terms. The key to taking the game away from England is more burn from Misbah followed by a hellacious cameo from Sarfraz Ahmed.

block-time published-time 6.00am BST 
 Vish will be with you shortly.  Whilst you wait, here's Ali Martin's ode to Misbah-ul-Haq, following the Pakistan's magnificent century on day one in Dubai.
Misbah-ul-Haq hinted before the current series with England that it could be his last in Test cricket, with the Pakistan captain revealing his preference to leave the stage on a high rather than be hooked unceremoniously from the wings.
We must therefore savour his unbeaten 102 on the first day in Dubai  that has put his side seemingly in charge of the second Test, for it could well be his last century in international cricket. But then when a batsman is 41 years and 147 days old, that tends to be the default position anyway.
Misbah was late in bringing up three figures here, swatting two huge sixes off Moeen Ali in the final over of the day before a reverse sweep around the corner for two made the milestone his. This is a cricketer who seemingly defies time, of course, with the bulk of his career in the colours of his country coming after most have long since called it a day. His ascension to the role of captain came in 2010, aged 36; an uncharacteristically shrewd piece of work by the Pakistan Cricket Board in reaction to the Lord's spot-fixing scandal during the tainted tour of England that year when his predecessor, Salman Butt, was suspended in disgrace.

Australia v New Zealand: day three of the first Test - as it happened; 
Australia leads by 503 runs at the conclusion of day three in BrisbaneCenturies to David Warner and Joe Burns continue Australia's dominance.

 Australia lead by 503 - the day that was 
Well, that's it for another day at the Gabba, where Australia pressed home its advantage even further to lead by 503 at stumps. There was notable resistance from Kane Williamson (140) late in New Zealand's innings when he posted a brilliant rearguard century, but that only led to more pain for the tourists when Joe Burns and David Warner resumed their demolition job of the first innings.
Burns (129) broke through for his maiden Test century and Warner (116) his second of the game in a blistering 237-run stand. From there it was a case of cheap wickets for the Kiwi bowlers - Mark Craig ended up with 3 as reward for a tough couple of days at the office - but the damage is now well and truly done.
There's storms forecast in Brisbane over the next couple of days, so it would be unsurprising if Australian skipper Steve Smith declared overnight and maximised his side's chances of ripping through the tourists.  
Anyway, that's it from me for today but make sure you drop by tomorrow for all the live action on day four. Adios.

 Stumps on day 3 - bad light ends play at the Gabba  
 42nd over: Australia 264-4 (Khawaja 9, Voges 0) 
Australia's 500-run lead is established not with a towering six or beligerant four, but a very uncool leg bye when Usman Khawaja misses a sweep. After Marsh goes, Voges does end up making an appearance under ever-darkening skies. They need a pink ball out there to be honest. The umpires convene again, talk briefly, and then lead the players off the ground. That'll be stumps on day 3 with Australia now 503 in front.

 Wicket! Smith c Williamson b Boult 1 (Australia 258-3)  
Geez, Smith almost needed a broom to get to that one and he thought it was a bump ball, but once he's satisfied that it didn't bounce immediately after he hit it he starts to walk off. But then...he sees that the Williamson catch is a little iffy on the slow-mo, with the Kiwi's fingers being jammed together very close to the turf. But he's gone! I think they made the right call there. 
block-time published-time 6.32pm AEST 
 Is Steve Smith out? Catch review?  
Kane Williamson thinks he's gone after grabbing what looked a catch at point but the umpires are referring it. Smith had backed away and speared the ball out towards point and Williamson swooped.

 40th over: Australia 257-2 (Khawaja 6, Smith 1) 
With Craig finally coming good it's perhaps not champagne cork time for Brendon McCullum and co because the sharp bounce and turn he's extracting from the pitch now will also be of great benefit to Nathan Lyon when the Australians have another bowl. They now lead by 496.

 WICKET! Burns c Taylor b Craig 129 (Australia 254-2)  
Craig gets another! Burns' job is done at this point and in looking for boundaries, he perishes by smashing Craig down to cow corner where Ross Taylor is waiting. Taylor runs in ten metres and takes a smart catch. What a knock.

 39th over: Australia 253-1 (Burns 129, Khawaja 3) 
With Warner gone and the lead now standing at 480+, Trent Boult returns to the attack with his left-arm pace. Burns pays him no respect, plenting his front foot down the track and smacking him for a four over long on and then a blazing six over long on. The second of those really came from the screws. He creamed it.

 38th over: Australia 239-1 (Burns 116, Khawaja 2) 
This is just video game batting now from Warner, who is bashing Mark Craig for a six (slog-sweep) and a four (inside-out lofted drive) to start the over before baseball-clubbing him over the umpire's hat for another. Then a switch hit! It's absurd stuff but in the process of tonking it out to long off he's caught by Boult, ending a truly entertaining few minutes. He goes for 116 from just 113 deliveries. Craig finally gets a wicket! 
block-time published-time 6.17pm AEST 
 Warner brings up his second century of the game!  
 37th over: Australia 223-0 (Burns 116, Warner 102) 
Good grief. Warner takes two off Bracewell's first delivery to move to 99 but in doing so, Burns should have been run out by a good metre or so but Mark Craig - taking the stumps at the bowler's end - can't even perform the simple task of hauling in the throw and breaking the stumps to Burns' dive is a successful one. It was a comedy of errors. 
On 99, Warner is jammed up by Bracewell, who is suddenly exerting pressure on the nervy batsman. But then Warner drives uppishly, perilously close to the hand of the man at short cover, but it pierces the gap to bring up his second century of the game! Sensational stuff. It's the third time he's done that in Tests.
block-time published-time 6.12pm AEST 
 36th over: Australia 216-0 (Burns 114, Warner 97) 
Now Burns gets in on the act, biffing Craig out to the fence with a slog-sweep and then giving Warner the strike with a single. Craig fancies a wicket here and Warner's a little loose at times but he taps a single down the ground to retain the strike for the next over. 
block-time published-time 6.10pm AEST 
 35th over: Australia 208-0 (Burns 108, Warner 95) 
Bracewell is still going through the motions and with a single off the second ball of his over, Burns brings up the 200-run partnership to go with the 150-run on he and Warner reached in the first innings. There's a bit of rain about again too, so Warner is always looking to attack and get his own milestone out of the way. He calls for a change of gloves and it's a fortuitous one, because Bracewell's next delivery is thumped into the stands to push Warner into the 90s.
block-time published-time 6.05pm AEST 
 34th over: Australia 199-0 (Burns 106, Warner 88) 
Mark Craig is looking a little nervous now because he could be in for an even bigger mugging than the first innings if Warner tees off. Oh dear, Warner tries to swift hit, misses it but BJ Watling had been blind-sided by the unconventional stroke and fumbles a stumping chance. Poor Mark Craig. It wasn't a great ball but he should have had a wicket then.

 33rd over: Australia 194-0 (Burns 104, Warner 85) 
Little Davey is putting his foot on the gas now, playing an upper cut off Bracewell to lift the struggling paceman over a vacant cordon area for four and then belting him out through cover for two. There's also overthrows in this over - from the sub fielder no less - because Warner is always making them think twice with his aggressive running.

Warner could be forgiven for taking a 'stand and deliver' approach here - and he does fall onto his back failing to play a a quite absurd switch slog-sweep off Mark Craig - but he's also still scurrying between wickets to push for twos and doing the little things well. The Brisbane sky, meanwhile, is dark and more than a little ominous.

Of course, after close to an hour of increasingly irritating waffle on the local broadcaster, myTV waits until the resumption of play to start cacking itself, so I see a slightly pixelated version of David Warner trying to hit Doug Bracewell's first delivery into Sunday but only getting fresh air. Looks like he's going to try and pass 100 before the declaration. He dabs four down to third man and then a single to long on to get started. Burns gets in on the act with a couple down to deep mid-wicket.
Is anyone else having this reception problem? Is anyone still reading? Are friends electric? Who'll stop the rain? What's the frequency, Kenneth? Who let the dogs out? Is she really going out with him? None of those questions will be answered in the next over.

As Warner looks to the skies and does a bit of amateur meteorology, Burns presses on towards another milestone by skipping down the wicket to Craig and lofting one down to the man at long on.

I think People for the Ethical Treatment of Jimmy Neesham must have stepped in because McCullum finally pulls him from the attack and brings Bracewell back into the fray as Warner and Burns bring up their 150-run partnership. Warner has been quite fascinating to watch in this Test; tighter, more determined and less given to wild swipes at the ball. Maybe he is taking this vice-captaincy business seriously.

Mark Craig battles on, bowling far better now than he was in the first innings and mostly eliminating the regular flow of boundary balls he'd offered up then.

Perhaps in fear of wasting an opportunity, both Burns and Warner are watchful against Craig at the moment and content to milk him for ones and twos. I'm not so sure that Neesham is loving how quickly the spinner rips through his overs though. He's deep inside the hurt locker at the moment.

There's actually something compelling about this Jimmy Neesham spell now; it's like some kind of ritual initiation or something. Why isn't Bracewell relieving him? Has McCullum just said, 'listen Jimmy, I know you're hurting but you're also not playing at the WACA, so bend your back old boy and really finish yourself off'? Maybe.
As all of this is happening there's a crack of lightning or two in the background. Neesham's probably hoping it'll strike him. Alas, that weather seems to be blowing away from the ground, not towards it.

Clonk! Burns is treating Neesham like a rental car now, stepping down the track and hoisting him ten rows back for a six. "I'm trying," Neesham appears to tell a conciliatory Brendon McCullum, but the bowler is clearly hobbled and just continuing so he doesn't let his country down. He simply can't afford to limp off and join Southee on the sidelines at the moment, the poor bloke. Burns has no mercy for him, cracking another short one out to the fence at deep square leg.

There's diminishing options for Brendon McCullum other than to keep Jimmy Neesham on right now so Burns is also presented with an easy way to bring up his second half-century of the game when he gets to turn another short one down to the third man boundary with minimal exertion and then squirt a follow-up in the same direction for the single that takes him to 50.

Chris Bowden has a confusing addendum to the Kiwi trophy cabinet debate. "You can probably see the Chappell-Hadlee trophy in there, Russell," he says.

Boult is entrusted with the final ball of the session and with Australia already rattling along at 6.5 per over, it's not like things can get much worse.

Anyway, the over passes without incident and with that the Australian batsmen head off for a well-earned drink. I might do the same if you don't mind, but I'll be back shortly.

Crunch! Burns leans back and cracks Neesham for a pair of fours to start this over, both close to identical in execution and the precise destination of the ball. I don't think the 140-character Don has learned his lesson there. Neither has he with regards to banging it in short and wide to David Warner, who lashes him for another boundary square of point. It doesn't look like much fun to be a bowler right now. They're counting down the seconds until tea.

Shots fired! Raymond Reardon appears with his first email of the day and they're fighting words. "Apart from historical records of past and current players records, are there any trophies in the NZ Cricket Museum you mentioned in the 6th over ?"
In the interest of preserving a convivial Trans-Tasman conversation, I won't weight in on that one but I am here to tell you that Trent Boult is back into the attack with much the same dross he was offering up earlier. Warner belts him for a boundary through point and there's singles aplenty as Boult struggles to replicate the same ball twice at any point in the over.

Monkey see, monkey don't. You'd think these New Zealanders would have learned something from Australia's bowling efforts but apparently not. Now Bracewell spears one down leg for Burns to tuck another four runs down to fine leg. I think Matt Henry can probably start preparing himself to play at the WACA.

 9th over: Australia 49-0 (Burns 17, Warner 31) 
It is indeed the 140-character Don who appears to replace the wayward Boult. He doesn't start well, gifting Warner a pair of twos by sending it down the leg side and then dishing up a full toss that Warner probably should have thumped into the stands but only bunts for one. His skipper Brendon McCullum would probably be a little more annoyed if he wasn't so puffed from all the chasing he's been doing in the field. 
Worse: Neesham is actually moving a little gingerly now, which isn't ideal with Southee already injured and out of the attack. McCullum might end up having to do the bowling himself. He probably deserves a drink too:

 8th over: Australia 44-0 (Burns 17, Warner 26) 
Continuing my so far unpopular series of observations relating to the home broadcaster's improved efforts in this game, there's a nice moment here when Ian Smith describes making his debut at the Gabba. Back then they still had the dog track going around the ground, so he had to cross a kind of wooden deck to get to the crease and settle his nerves, only to be confronted by a sweaty, snarling Len Pascoe. That sounds like fun.
Anyway, Jimmy Neesham has had a shocker here, diving over the top a ball at mid on and missing it, bringing to mind the Sydney Harbour Bridge more than any Queensland landmarks. It only costs two, fortunately for him. I think he's about to have a bowl, Jimmy.

 7th over: Australia 41-0 (Burns 15, Warner 25) 
Such is the diminished state of Boult's efforts he's got a man sweeping the deep cover boundary now for the one he keeps dropping short. Warner belts it out there for a single but it's a dire state of affairs that MCullum's having to err on the side of containment in the seventh over. Futile too, because Burns rocks back to the next ball - again short - and slams it over mid-wicket for a boundary. Boult couldn't throw a hoop down a hill at the moment. He's bowling like a drain.
block-time published-time 3.03pm AEST 
 6th over: Australia 34-0 (Burns 10, Warner 23) 
Warner's in such rude form he's practically walking at Bracewell as he deliveries the ball because right now it's like he's got a sixth sense for where the ball is going to pitch. There's three here past McCullum at mid off and I get the feeling we could be in for some fireworks here. Warner was circumspect in the first innings - at least by his standards - but he might go berserk here.

 5th over: Australia 30-0 (Burns 9, Warner 20) 
Boult bowls a short one that hurries onto Warner a little here but even if the shot has an element of flinching about it, he still fashions a pull shot that carries the ball away to the boundary at deep square leg. A few balls later he turns Boult to fine leg and refusing to rest on his laurels, hares between the wickets to get back for a second run and that plans a seed that allows him to pressure Latham into a fielding error in the deep moments later, so he gets two more. 
Warner ends up with 3 twos in that over to go with the boundary; death by a thousand cuts. Without taking undue risks he and Burns are going at a run a ball.

 4th over: Australia 20-0 (Burns 9, Warner 10) 
It's becoming increasingly clear that missing the Matador Cup domestic one-dayers has certainly not hurt David Warner's batting form because he appears to have all the time in the world to play his shots right now. He cracks Bracewell for two through cover and then nudges a single in the same direction.
block-time published-time 2.46pm AEST 
 3rd over: Australia 16-0 (Burns 9, Warner 7) 
Trent Boult has been a real fizzer in this Test, mostly because he's down on pace and energy in his return from injury. First up here he dishes up a gentle length ball that Warner punches through cover for three and then there's an all-run four when Burns crunches him through the same region. So far so uninspiring from the Kiwi strike bowler.
block-time published-time 2.42pm AEST 
 2nd over: Australia 9-0 (Burns 5, Warner 4) 
With Southee sick and sore, it's Doug Bracewell who partners with Boult to start with, which wouldn't have been McCullum's plan going into the game but he'll have to roll with it. Jimmy Neesham will need to put in a decent shift with the ball, too. But how long will the Aussies bat given the ever-present threat of storms in Brisbane? I reckon they'll belt a quick 250 and insert the tourists sometime early tomorrow - an audacious call, I know.
It's a decent first over from Dougy B; disciplined and consistent in its adherence to the basic principles of line and length.
block-time published-time 2.37pm AEST 
 1st over: Australia 9-0 (Burns 5, Warner 4) 
Trent Boult takes the new ball for New Zealand and dropping short to Burns with his second delivery, gets pulled away imperiously for a quick boundary. Take that! Burns gets off strike with an inside-edge to leg but that's actually bad news for the bowler, because he's then belted through the off side by Warner to concede another early boundary. 
"You're right about Williamson," says Robert Wilson. "He's quite good at the old cricket. He's been like that for a couple of years now and it's hard to make an argument for Smith or Root being better. Certainly not as a spectacle." No disagreements from me on that one.

 As Warner and Burns start padding up... 
Here's some stats from that Australian bowling effort, because there's not much to say about the Kiwi batting beyond Williamson's majestic 140: Starc ended up with 4-57 from 17.2 overs and bowled beautifully in patches. Johnson had 3-105 from 21 and veered between truly intimidating and, well, a little bit erratic. Hazlewood was the hard luck story with 1-70 from his 21 penetrating overs and Nathan Lyon - 1 for 46 off 17 - contained the Kiwi batsmen well where his opposite number Mark Craig had bled runs. Mitch Marsh got a handy breakthrough after lunch but got biffed around a bit otherwise.
Anyway, a couple more minutes and the Aussies are back out there batting.

 WICKET! Williamson c Nevill b Starc 140 (New Zealand all out for 317)  
 Williamson finally goes!  It was a magical innings - 140 from 178 balls with 24 boundaries - but he gets a beauty from Starc and knicks an inside edge through to Nevill behind the stumps. It looked like it might have clipped the off stump on the way through as well but either way he's gone and the Kiwi innings ends at 317 - 239 behind the Australian first innings. And it looks as though Australia will not be enforcing the follow-on, which appears sensible.

Hazlewood relieves Johnson and grabs the new ball, but he'd probably prefer to be bowling to Boult first up that Williamson, who threads the eye of the needle by cutting him for four through point. Hazlewood gets one ball to Boult and the Kiwi gets forward in determined style to block it out. Williamson's played this beautifully to farm the strike. He's got 7 tons in his last 24 innings. Safe to say he knows what he's doing.

 Southee is castled!  The new ball does the trick for Mitch Starc, who is errant to start with but eventually hoops it in beautifully to splatter Southee's stumps. The big Kiwi was backing away and swinging wildly all over, because he's really been in pain out there. A ball earlier he'd been cracked on the back pad as he tried to launch one into orbit and it was a case of 'you miss, I hit' for Starc.

Starc returns in anticipation of the new ball but also, perhaps, to see if he can extract something interesting with the old ball before it goes. Anyway, at the very least he's blown off the cobwebs here and will be right to go with the brand spanker.

Williamson is a genius. Mitchell Johnson does nothing wrong here with an off-cutter that would ask questions of your mortal batsmen, but Williamson gets forward and turns the face of the bat to deflect it through gully. It's a gorgeous shot to pick up four. The Johnson over finishes with another boundary when Sir Kane (am I going the early crow there? I don't think so) thumps him through point. His top-order colleagues should be hanging their heads in shame right now.

Mitch Marsh continues from the Vulture Street end and also continues his tendency to overstep the line and cough up no-balls. Then Southee biffs him over mid-on for four and call me crazy, but I get the feeling that Southee is here for a good time but possibly not a long time. His best defence is attack. He doesn't die wondering. He's never backward in coming forward. And that's why we love him: he conjures up so many cliches. Marsh has probably done his job now I reckon.

Johnson's back to pair with Marsh and where the part-timer was all smiles early, the lefty is grimacing when he strays wide from around the wicket and Williamson clatters him through gully for a boundary. But the big quick follows it with an absolute peach that squares the rampant batsman up and screams past his outside edge. Good stuff. 
People are going wild for the Geoff Lemon facts now and they want more. Well, Brendan Brown does. "And I thought my size 12 was something to be proud of. You know what they say, "Big feet, big......shoes".

"No you aren't a bad person for wanting to see the carnage of Mumford vs Lee, it is quite human!" he says. "Just like I am desperately waiting to see NZ get hopelessly smashed around the Gabbatoir for another 3 or 4 sessions, I suppose... And I personally quite enjoyed Piers Morgan's attempt to face Brett Lee. He might have looked like a deer in the headlights, and backed away from the thunderbolts, but he walked the talk and suited up for 6 of the best from Brett which is more than most people would do given the chance." True Andy, true.
"Now to business; my own suggestion for a musician to face Bing would be Dr Hook, partly as revenge for my mum's endless playing of his tapes in the car when I was young, but mostly for the name - would it not be cool if he could pivot and put one over his shoulder to truly earn the moniker, "Dr Hook"? The eyepatch would make the feat even cooler (if he survived the experience)."

Is he the Leon Trotsky or Shelly Miscavage of Guardian cricket? The OBO has everything EXCEPT a good conspiracy theory. I'm blaming you. You've taken over. At best you come out of this a Stalinist Scientologist. Where's Lemon? I want proof of life."
He's actually at the Gabba, Bobbo, doing a bit of radio, a bit of writing, and knowing the great man, wolfing down literally kilograms of free food while doing some freestyle slam poetry. In lieu of his presence in this Test, how about I drip feed you with Lemon facts through out the day?

The big moment finally arrives and disappointingly, Lee actually goes a bit too easy on old mate, but does splatter his middle stump with his second delivery. Marcus? Is that his name? Anyway, now he knows what I feel like listening to his music.

Before we get to the cricket - and excuse me delving for a moment into trivial matters - I'm in a conflicted frame of mind right now. Remember when Brett Lee bowled bouncers at Piers Morgan during the lunch break of the 2013-14 Ashes series and there was a quite justified outcry about how stupid and irresponsible the whole thing was? Well... I agreed with those complaining at the time. But now... he's got the opportunity to put a few into the ribs of the lead singer of Mumford and Sons. Everything in me is saying "Yes! Yes!

Nathan Lyon on for Mitchell Johnson. Craig gets a single and It's Lyon to Williamson. The offie is coming around the wicket to the right-hander, with bat-pad, leg and orthodox slip. Williamson tickles one off his hip - literally, it just hits his hip, no bat - and beats that leg slip for one. Craig gets a single and then Williamson rushes through for a risky one. Johnson does the fielding and fires to the nonstriker's end where Lyon can't quit gathers but Williamson just makes his ground anyhow.

Uppish, is Craig, but good form through the shot as he punches again down the ground for four.  It's Hazlewood back bowling, by the way. He started us off from the other end. He surprises Craig with a short ball that the Kiwi has to fend away, while taking a hand off the bat. A single taken brings Williamson on strike for the last ball and he's so quick on the length, which isn't even that shot. Short-arm jab through midwicket gets him four.

 56th over: New Zealand 210-6 (Williamson 76, Craig 14) 
Williamson plays the most immaculate defensive shot and manages to find a single in the offside. Forget what I said about Craig's feet, he's just readjusted them in double quick time to time a full, inswinging ball off Mitchell Johnson through mid on for four!  Johnson's had enough and comes around the wicket last ball. It's angled in awkwardly at Craig's hip, but the leftie does well to drop his hands in time to divert the ball behind square on the legside for one.

Williamson holds onto a cut long enough to beat point AND gully, who are a matter of feet apart. And my word is it delicious. But Mark Craig serves up some pleasure of his own, standing tall into a punch through cover that gets him four to the longer square boundary.

 53rd over: New Zealand 192-6 (Williamson 70, Craig 2) 
Williamson skews Starc for four  at a very catchable height through the vacant gully region. To be fair, it's vacant because he's been faultless up until this moment: Smith doing his best to target his strong zones and, at the very least, limit his run-getting. A single gives Starc a go at Craig, who immediately edges past his stumps for two. He's off the mark.

 52nd over: New Zealand 185-6 (Williamson 65, Craig 0) 
Nothing shot from Watling, who had looked good up to the first ball of this over. Good length from Johnson but it's wide and could have been left alone. He has a play and nicks behind. Off-spinner Mark Craig is up next - a left-handed bat who has three fifties in 16 Test innings. File him under "No Mug". He's wary of the short ball, hopping to his first ball and playing it down, before ducking his second. He's struck in front but the ball's going down leg.

Watling gets the strike back and plays a wicketkeeper's cut through cover-point for the over's second boundary.

A couple of reasons I think, Sean. In no particular order - New Zeaand are Salmonella levels undercooked and Australia just don't lose at the Gabba. As a collective, New Zealand didn't bowl well but Tim Southee was unlucky not to see a few off on that first morning - I lost count of how many times he beat the outside edge.

Watching the bounding Mitchell Starc bowl Twitter's Jimmy Neesham was like watching Predator rip Bambi's mum limb from limb and then turn up to Bambi's house every Mother's day and flick him the Vs.

James Brown - 10 of the best; 
The father of funk, the godfather of soul, Mr Dynamite, soul brother number one: in a career spanning five decades, James Brown certainly lived up to his names.

John Doran.

1. Please, Please, Please
After James Brown died on Christmas Day in 2006, many obituary writers felt there was something that needed to be mentioned as a priority before they listed his many achievements, that the former Hardest Working Man In Show Business really was a nasty piece of work. I have no desire to buck this trend here. Few musicians who worked with him stayed the course for long, and they sometimes parted ways with him acrimoniously. Some left his employ feeling he had ripped off their ideas, not credited them fully for their work, or owing them money. In his biography, The Life of James Brown, Geoff Brown notes that he was an "ill-tempered, inveterate, emotional and physical scrapper" before adding: "A list of people physically assaulted by him would not be a short one, nor would it be restricted to the male of the species."
Few musicians who worked with him stayed the course for long and sometimes parted ways with him acrimoniously 
Perhaps one could make a posthumous defence for Brown's behaviour based on biographical facts. He entered this world in a one-room tin shack, outside Barnwell, South Carolina, on 3 May 1933. He was born in ill health: he came close to dying during childbirth and had to be resuscitated. He was an African American/Cherokee in a deeply racist and still segregated society. His mother left when he was four. As a child he picked cotton, cut sugar cane and shined shoes. When he was 10, he moved with his aunt into a boarding house cum brothel and gambling den, where he was beaten regularly by his father and others. By the age of 11 he was forced into petty crime: shoplifting and stealing hubcaps and car batteries to buy food and clothes. 
While scraping by as a child, Brown was also busy learning to play organ, bass, guitar, saxophone, trumpet and drums. One of the accusations levelled at him by those who presumably never looked beyond Living in America and Sex Machine is that Brown was little more than a bullying band leader who bellowed childish gibberish over simplistic grooves played by other, more talented musicians. But the truth is that he could play more instruments than most. At 15, the budding musician was caught breaking into a car and sentenced to eight to 16 years at Georgia Juvenile Training Institute. Brown seems to have prospered while incarcerated, despite harsh conditions. He founded a gospel quartet, , and he met Bobby Byrd, whose family's sponsorship helped him get parole after only three years. Byrd would become Brown's right-hand man for most of his adult life. 
Please, Please, Please was James Brown and the Famous Flames' first single, released in 1956 by Federal. And there, from the outset, is that voice: torrid, strident, awash with powerful emotion. The song is raw and special, and it became a sleeper hit - yet one that the Famous Flames would struggle to follow up - eventually reaching No 6 on the Billboard R&B chart. There's a case to be made for this first single being Brown's signature song. He closed the vast majority of live shows with it, right up until the year he died, usually combined with his flamboyant and electrifying cape routine.

2. Papa's Got a Brand New Bag
Brown was involved in the production of a landmark record in 1963, the game-changing Live at the Apollo. This phenomenal LP spearheaded a change in the perception of black musicians being only singles rather than album artists. Yet it would be another two years before the musician started living up to his initial promise as regards the Billboard chart. From 1965, he kicked off a series of hits, which included It's a Man's Man's Man's World, I Got You (I Feel Good) and the mighty Papa's Got a Brand New Bag. With this track, stripped back and minimal, with a breakbeat that could fell a rhino. , Brown was now creating a trailblazing sound all of his own.

3. Cold Sweat
When the accolade for creating a genre of music is awarded to one musician, there is usually critical dissent. The boundaries between musical styles of are often poorly defined and open to interpretation. But if there is one person from the canon of late 20th-century music who can e awarded this prestigious honour, it is James Brown. You only have to listen to Cold Sweat once and compare it to contemporaneous soul fare from 1967 such as It Takes Two by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell, or Mustang Sally by Wilson Pickett, to see what a huge leap forward Brown had taken in hammering soul into funk. In fact, it was Pickett that Brown had in his sights when he said: "Before I let them take my sound, I'll break out in a cold sweat!" His record company, too, must have been perspiring in fear when they heard this monstrous groove with its sickly, elastic, one-chord bass line, demented screaming and thunderous breakbeat - until, that is, it got to No 1 on the Billboard R&B chart, where it stayed for three weeks. 

4. Say It Loud - I'm Black and I'm Proud
James Brown and Clyde Stubblefield made making history look so simple
The events surrounding the release, in 1968, of the single Say It Loud - I'm Black and I'm Proud provide a glimpse into the complex and sometimes contradictory belief systems of Mr Dynamite. Brown was, among other things, part traditional southern gent, part bootstrapped American dreamer, part avariciously cold-blooded capitalist and part Afro-conscious black radical. His pragmatic desire to be able to flit between these roles helped created the stress fractures along which his career would eventually crumble. Brown had hitherto kept the radical black left at arm's length despite being courted furiously by them, but sensing his profound talismanic power over young black America in the late 60s, his dedication to the cause went into overdrive after the murder of Martin Luther King in April 1968. But Brown's initial move was to release a couple of singles with a decidedly conservative overtone. First came the curious Licking Stick - a functional and loose jam about corporal punishment - followed closely by the subpar, conservative funk of America Is My Home - an attempt to write a new, shamelessly consumerist, anti-peace movement anthem. As he said at the time: "I'm attempting to spread black power through ownership." The release of Say It Loud in August changed things drastically, albeit temporarily. It was inevitable that the song would be seized upon as a radical black anthem, but the uneasy detente that Brown struck with the militants didn't even last for six months. It was shattered for good when he played Richard Nixon's inaugural ball in January 1969. Perhaps Brown's political philosophy could actually be better summed up by the self-explanatory 1969 single I Don't Want Nobody to Give Me Nothing (Open Up the Door, I'll Get It Myself). The simple message of this track is more radical, incisive and germane in relation to the civil rights movement of the late 60s than the entire lyrical output of Bob Dylan. 

5. Funky Drummer
I wouldn't want to downplay the significance of Clyde Stubblefield's break on this long funk jam, given that it is one of the 20th century's most instantly recognisable drumbeats. It certainly ranks alongside the Winstons' Amen Brother and the Honey Drippers' Impeach the President in terms of the number of times it's been samped. However, it does feel like an afterthought when heard in the context of the whole track, which was almost certainly semi-improvised, so maybe it was. The lyrics, such as they are, mainly serve as instructions to the musicians, Stubblefield being prime among them: "You don't have to do no soloing, brother, just keep what you got ... Don't turn it loose, 'cause it's a mother." Brown is so made up with the eight bars of unaccompanied drums when they arrive that he immediately christens the song in Stubblefield's honour: "The name of this tune is the Funky Drummer!" They made making history look so simple. 

6. Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine
Sick of Brown's half-century oeuvre being reduced to this one track, funk devotees can often display a kneejerk dismissiveness to this song. Sex Machine can feel like it's never off certain radio stations and it has been featured in countless TV shows and films, simply because it has become universally understood shorthand for "funk". But there's a damn good reason for that: it's a stone-cold classic. You could be forgiven for thinking that Brown's backing band had been together for a decade, such is the tightness they display, but nothing could be further from the truth. This was one of the first tracks his new crew, the JBs, recorded, with the teenage Bootsy Collins on bass and his older brother Catfish on guitar. Brown himself plays the piano lick in the inimitable style with which he attacks all instruments, and again reveals himself to be a true artist in the sense that his work was ever evolving. The song started life as an onstage improvised vamp that eventually solidified into Give It Up or Turnit a Loose. Brown was unable to rest on his laurels, though. He would never quit reworking material until it often developed into something brand-new. Check out the next stage in the Sex Machine evolution: the utterly berserk Get Up, Get Into It, Get Involved and listen to the armour-piercing horn stabs and death metal-strength vocal exhortations for an example of constant musical evolution in action. 

7. Talking Loud and Saying Nothing
There's a well-worn phrase attributed to Detroit legend Derrick May that describes techno as sounding like "George Clinton and Kraftwerk stuck in a lift". As much as I love Funkadelic and Parliament, there is something too fluid and spaced-out about their grooves for this description to be 100% accurate. May should have paired the D¸sseldorf quartet with the JBs, who, by the mid-70s, were one of the most fearsome house bands on the planet. The precision of their mechanical, muscular grooves was, no doubt, guided by a tyrannical Brown who would hand out on-the-spot fines to anyone who played bum notes. Talking Loud and Saying Nothing is the band at their most fearsomely tight, and arguably the most effective funk track ever recorded. Bootsy Collins's bass playing is terrifyingly hypnotic and the metronomic force that drummer Jabo Starks and conga player Johnny Griggs are locked into. Check out the bravura, instrument-free breakdown during which Brown and Bobby Byrd keep the rhythm pounding through their call-and-response chants. Pure, unadulterated dancefloor dynamite, a white-hot explosion of funk. 

8. The Payback
Brown's fortunes took a turn for the worse through his ties to Nixon, an association that damaged his standing with many of his black fans. He went from being the man who'd sold a million tickets at the Harlem Apollo in 1969 to someone who had debts totalling $5m by 1978, though the reasons for this were more complex than just political conservatism. The only notable cash spike during this downward slide happened because of The Payback album. Never one to ignore a new trend, Brown got on board with the blaxploitation boom and recorded the original film soundtracks to both Black Caesar and Slaughter's Big Rip Off in 1973. He produced a third that year, for the film Hell Up in Harlem, but it was rejected by studio bosses for being "the same old thing" and, apocryphally, for not being funky enough. It was released by Polydor as The Payback, and one listen to the title track reveals a low-slung, low-BPM groove monster that is not only funkier than a mosquito's tweeter, but clearly owes a stylistic debt to blaxploitation dons Curtis Mayfield and Isaac Hayes. It is both brilliant and entirely on message. It was the studio's loss: it would be Brown's only certified gold studio album. 

9. Funky President (People It's Bad)
Things were starting to unravel creatively for Brown by 1974. Even as a fan, one has to admit that the Reality LP is pretty much a collection of worthless tracks - with one notable exception. Brown had just turned 40, and suddenly the idea of releasing five new singles and three new albums in one year was starting to look like idiocy. This LP was clearly the runt of that year's litter, recorded in NYC with session men instead of the JBs, so perhaps it's no surprise that Funky President remains one of Brown's most overlooked singles. Watergate had brought down Nixon, Gerald Ford was interim president and, given Brown's public political endorsement, it's not too much of a stretch to see this call for black self-determination as a frantic attempt to distance himself from the scandal. It's not the only time Nixon's downfall and Brown's financial crisis intertwine in his discography: when Brown leads the chant: "I need some money!" in the JBs' You Can Have Watergate, Just Gimme Some Bucks and I'll Be Straight, he isn't lying. 

10. Get Up Offa That Thing
It would be wrong to pretend that Brown's career ended after the mid-70s, as he enjoyed several bursts of popularity in later years. New generations would be introduced to the power of his music by sampledelia, hip-hop and the mid-90s funk revival. And that's before we get to Rocky IV and The Blues Brothers. However, Get Up Offa That Thing really is Brown's star finally going supernova. In creative terms, it's a last massive expulsion of energy. He hadn't scored a hit for a year and was clearly on the downward slope, something that was playing on his mind. In his 1986 autobiography, The Godfather of Soul, Brown describes the anguish he felt one day when looking out from the stage to see his entire audience sitting down despite the typically high energy show he and his band were putting on: "I looked out at all those people sitting there, and because I was depressed, they looked depressed. I yelled, 'Get up offa that thing and dance til you feel better!' I probably meant until I felt better." And what a fightback this incident inspired. Get Up Offa That Thing was released 20 years after his debut single and it combines disco and funk into one glorious, explosive whole. It remains dancefloor catnip to this day.

Jamie Briggs scandal: politicians are not above the law, Diversity Council says; 
Council's chief executive says Briggs should be held to account on workplace harassment and rejects claims the ministerial standards he breached before standing down were too high.

Shalailah Medhora.

Politicians are not above the law and should be held to account on workplace harassment in the same way other employees are, the Diversity Council Australia has said in the wake of the scandal engulfing former minister, Jamie Briggs.
Briggs, who resigned from the frontbench last month after admitting he had behaved inappropriately towards a female diplomatic staffer, should be held accountable for his actions, the council's chief executive, Lisa Annese, said.

"It's vital that leaders lead by example," Annese told Guardian Australia. "People mirror the behaviour of their leaders in the workplace."
Annese rejected claims the ministerial standards Briggs breached before standing down were too high.
"[Politicians] are not above the law," she said. "We need to live by the standards of the people we employ... Everyone should be subject to the same laws."
Annese noted the difficulty faced by the staffer in coming forward.

"The capacity to speak out is always around power [imbalance]," she said.
The young woman, who was reportedly on her first diplomatic posting, complained after Briggs allegedly complimented her on her eyes and then put his arm around her and kissed her on the cheek or neck, following a night out in Hong Kong in November. 
Briggs, then cities minister, had been in Hong Kong on ministerial business, and the incident took place after Briggs, his chief of staff Stuart Eaton and the unnamed young woman went out to dinner and drinks after the day's official itinerary.
A spokeswoman for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Dfat) told Guardian Australia the young woman, who was a department staffer working in Hong Kong, was being well looked after.
"Dfat takes seriously the welfare of all its staff. Dfat has exercised its duty of care responsibilities for the officer concerned, including providing appropriate support and seeking to protect her privacy," the spokeswoman said in a statement. "For privacy reasons, we will not comment further."
Labor criticised the former minister for distributing images of the staffer even after vowing to protect her identity during his resignation speech.
"Mr Briggs made a lot of protecting the complainant's privacy. He mentioned that a number of times in his [December] press conference. It's completely inconsistent with that for a text message with photos of the complainant to be shared among members of the government," the acting opposition leader, Penny Wong, said.  
                     " I think some of the behaviour post the press conference that we've just been discussing, including the fact that a photo of complainant was sent around, really confirms that it isn't appropriate for Mr Briggs to continue in the ministry."

The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said he was disappointed in the conduct that led to Briggs' resignation from the ministry.
"Ministers are expected to uphold high standards of behaviour as set out in the ministerial standards. On this occasion his conduct fell short of that standard," Turnbull said in a statement issued last week. "After being invited to reflect on his position, he offered his resignation which I have accepted." 
                     Ministerial standards state that office-holders must ensure their "conduct in a private capacity upholds the laws of Australia, and demonstrates appropriately high standards of personal integrity".
"Ministers shall ensure that their personal conduct is consistent with the dignity, reputation and integrity of the parliament," the document stated.
On Sunday, the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, admitted to accidentally sending an offensive text message about a female journalist intended for Briggs to the journalist in question instead.
Dutton promptly apologised to News Corp reporter Samantha Maiden for labelling her a "mad fucking witch" in response to her coverage of the Briggs allegations.
In a statement released on Monday evening Turnbull said: "As I advised the minister [Peter Dutton] yesterday his language was clearly inappropriate as he recognised by apologising immediately to Ms Maiden."
A spokeswoman for the prime minister stressed the situation with Dutton and the one that saw Briggs resign were two very different scenarios.

HSBC escapes action by City regulator following Swiss tax scandal; 
Financial Conduct Authority will take no action against bank whose Swiss arm helped clients to evade tax.

Jill Treanor.

HSBC will not face formal action from the City regulator following revelations that the Swiss arm of Britain's biggest bank helped clients to evade tax.
HSBC was engulfed in scandal a year ago when leaked bank account details showed how the bank's Swiss unit helped wealthy customers to dodge taxes by concealing assets and handing out bundles of cash to avoid the authorities. 
At the time, the Financial Conduct Authority said it was looking at the working practices inside the bank after admitting it had learned about the details of the activities in the Swiss bank from the reports in the Guardian and other publications. However, the FCA has now concluded that review and will not take formal action against HSBC.
The FCA would not comment on the decision, first reported by Sky News, butit said in February 2015 that the leak of the bank account details "has served to reinforce the importance of firms operating with the right culture across all of their operations".
Martin Wheatley, the then chief executive of the FCA, said: "The allegations are about a Swiss unit of the bank, based on events of predominantly 2005-2007... We are very closely monitoring the ability of the bank overall ... and we think significant improvements have been made".
Wheatley resigned in Jul y when George Osborne did not renew his contract, sparking speculation that the chancellor wanted to take a softer stance towards the City. A successor for Wheatley has not been named and the regulator ended 2015 facing criticism of its decision to end a review of culture at banks that had been outlined in its business plan earlier in the year.
HSBC, which declined to comment on Monday, has repeatedly said it has changed its practices, including an overhaul of its structure that began in 2011.
Last year, the Geneva authorities instructed HSBC to pay a  record 40m Swiss francs (£28m) for "organisational deficiencies". A month ago, HervÈ Falciani, an IT expert, was sentenced  to five years in prison by a Swiss court for aggravated industrial espionage, data theft and violation of commercial and banking secrecy. Falciani was convicted in his absence and did not attend the trial.
HSBC is currently reviewing whether to keep its headquarters in the UK, where it has been based since the early 1990s following the takeover of Midland Bank. The outcome is expected early this year. The bank has published 11 factors it will consider during the review, which include the government's tax policy and attitude to financial services companies.
The FCA decision emerged as the bank's UK arm - which has 17 million customers - tweeted on Monday that people were having problems logging on to online and mobile banking services. Towards the end of the day, it tweeted: "Personal banking customers should now be able to access the mobile app, although we continue to work on a fix for desktop users". 
It is the latest IT problem for a big bank. On New Year's Day, Royal Bank of Scotland's customers had problems using their debit cards in shops.

Ex-Asda boss admits stealing charity funds to give to boyfriend's ballet firm; 
Paul Kelly, a former vice-president of corporate affairs, faces jail for taking £180,000 from retailer's flood funds to prop up Murley Dance Company.

Graham Ruddick and agencies.

A former Asda executive is facing jail after admitting to stealing £180,000 from the retailer's charity fund for his partner's ballet company.
Paul Kelly, who was the retailer's vice-president of corporate affairs, pleaded guilty to seven charges of fraud at Leeds crown court. 
He is accused of lying about where the charity funds were going and claiming that the ballet company run by his 36-year-old partner, dancer David Murley, fell within the remit of the Asda Foundation. The money was supposed to go to flood victims.
The former Asda executive was also a government adviser on food policy, alcohol and obesity and an ambassador for Prince Charles's Business in the Community charity. Kelly attended promotional events for the Tour de France's Grand Depart in Yorkshire in 2014 with the then deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg.
Kelly left Asda in September 2014 after an internal investigation.
Three charges relate to Kelly acting "dishonestly and intending to make a gain for himself or another" by making a false representation to the Asda Foundation that money was going to flood victims when instead they were going to the Murley Dance Company. It was not suggested that the dance company was aware that the funds it received were dishonest.
The four remaining charges are connected to Kelly making false representations that the dance company was a charitable organisation whose objectives met those of the Asda Foundation. The offending took place between July 2013 and May 2014.
As well as being head of corporate affairs, a role that spanned media and government relations, Kelly was chairman of the charitable association.
He worked for Asda for seven years and before that was corporate affairs director at catering group Compass. He left Asda days before he was scheduled to sit on a panel at a Labour party conference with Yvette Cooper, who was then shadow home secretary.
Asda said none of the causes it supports would be financially disadvantaged by the scandal. 
The case was adjourned for a pre-sentence report and a psychiatric report. Kelly will be sentenced on 16 February.

'Snooper's charter' will cost British lives, MPs are warned; 
Former NSA security chief-turned-whistleblower says plan for bulk collection of communications data is '99% useless'.

Alan Travis , home affairs editor, and Owen Bowcott, legal affairs correspondent.

The "snooper's charter" legislation extending the mass surveillance powers of the intelligence agencies will "cost lives in Britain", a former US security chief has warned MPs and peers. 
William Binney, a former technical director of the US National Security Agency (NSA), told parliamentarians that the plans for bulk collection of communications data tracking everyone's internet and phone use are "99% useless" because they would swamp intelligence analysts with too much data.
He was particularly critical of a previously secret GCHQ surveillance system disclosed by the whistleblower Edward Snowden called Black Hole, which was built in 2008 and helps list everyone in the world who has ever visited a website. 
"This approach costs lives, and has cost lives in Britain because it inundates analysts with too much data. It is 99% useless. Who wants to know everyone who has ever [been] at Google or the BBC? We have known for decades that that swamps analysts," said Binney, who turned whistleblower after 36 years in which he conducted and led signals intelligence operations and research for the NSA.
Binney gave evidence on Wednesday to the committee of MPs and peers scrutinising Theresa May's draft investigatory powers bill, which will codify and extend the existing bulk collection powers of the intelligence agencies, including the storage of records of every website or internet connection made by British citizens.
The former NSA director testified that while targeted data collection operations could help prevent terror attacks, "overcollection" of mass data undermined security and had consistently cost lives because of this "analysis paralysis".
Binney told MPs that the 9/11 attacks on the US could have been prevented if the NSA had filtered the relevant data and not attempted to collect everything.
He said: "Sixteen months before the attacks on America, our organisation [Signit Automation Research Center - Sarc] was running a new method of finding terrorist networks that worked on focusing on 'smart collection'. Their plan was rejected in favour of a much more expensive plan to collect all communications from everyone.
"The US large-scale surveillance plan failed. It had to be abandoned in 2005. Checks afterwards showed that communications from the terrorists had been collected, but not looked at in time."
Binney said his experience as the lead NSA analyst for "strategic warning" concerning the Soviet Union and then Russia, and later dealing with terrorism, showed that "to be effective and timely we had to avoid burying our analysts".
He said: "Our approach was totally different to the historic bulk collect and then word/phrase dictionary select-type approach in general use even to this day. In particular, we developed and deployed surveillance tools applying minimisation at the point(s) of collection. This approach reduces the burden on analysts required to review extremely large quantities of irrelevant material with consequent improvement to operational effectiveness.
"At the same time, it reduces the privacy burden affecting the large number of innocent and suspicion-free persons whose communications are accessible to our systems."
He told MPs that "Britain should not go further down this road and risk making the same mistakes as my country did, or they will end up perpetuating the loss of life".
Binney also said a targeted approach had the additional advantage that legally protected groups such as MPs, lawyers and journalists could have their communications screened out and excluded from bulk collection and analysis unless and a designated and targeted authorisation was in place.
The information commissioner, Christopher Graham, later told the committee that there should be a sunset clause in the legislation requiring parliament to review regularly how it is working. He said there was a huge risk in the amount of information that would be retained. 
The question for MPs, Graham said, was under what regulatory regime should the intelligence agencies be allowed access to digital information records for law enforcement purposes. He said the government had yet to make a convincing case as to why information should be retained by internet service providers for a 12-month period. 
Graham urged MPs to increase the penalties available to be imposed on those who abuse their position of trust by illegally exploiting or passing on data collected by the police, intelligence services and other government agencies. At present the highest penalty is a fine.

Maria Eagle pledges to challenge Tories on BBC and Leveson in new culture role; 
Former shadow defence secretary launches into new position by attacking government on arts and sports cuts and press regulation.

Mark Sweney.

Maria Eagle, Labour's new shadow culture secretary, has pledged to take the Conservatives to task on its "attack" on the BBC and will call on the government to push forward with implementing the Leveson proposals on press regulation.
Eagle, who had a brief stint as shadow defence secretary following a reshuffle in September after Jeremy Corbyn was elected Labour leader, was something of a surprise appointment, announced in the early hours of Wednesday morning. 
The 54-year-old, who is viewed as having been demoted in the shadow cabinet because her support for the Trident nuclear deterrent put her at odds with Corbyn, moved quickly to set out her stall to show she is determined to make an impact in her new role.
Eagle said she was "pleased" to have been appointed to the role and immediately went on the offensive attacking the Tories over cuts, the BBC and press regulation.
She tweeted that culture, the arts and sport are an "important part of our national life but under this Tory government we have seen them suffer from huge cuts " adding that the BBC is one of the UK's "most treasured institutions". 
She went on to say that she will be "calling on the government to proceed with the implementation of proposals put forward by Leveson" on press regulation.
Eagle replaces Michael Dugher, a former spokesman for Gordon Brown who replaced Chris Bryant as shadow culture secretary in September. Dugher was said to have been removed from his post because he spent more time attacking the Labour leadership than the Conservatives. 
Eagle appears keen to pick up Dugher's baton and push, belatedly, for part two of the Leveson inquiry investigating the role of the press and police in the phone-hacking scandal. Dugher and his team sent a draft report on the government's failure to proceed with part two of the Leveson inquiry to Corbyn just before Christmas.
The government has argued that part two of the Leveson inquiry cannot commence until all current police investigations and any subsequent criminal proceedings have been completed.
Eagle, born on Merseyside to a printer and seamstress and educated at Pembroke college in Oxford, has some experience of media.
She was a member of the public accounts committee, which annually grills the BBC, from 1997 to 1999 and sat on the Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Bill committee in 2001. 
Corbyn's reshuffle saw Eagle's twin sister Angela named shadow first secretary of state and shadow secretary of state for business, innovation and skills. 
In 2010, the pair were the first sisters to sit around a Labour cabinet table together.
Eagle has a strong track record in promoting equality and diversity, perhaps in part due to her sister being gay; she came out publicly in a newspaper interview in 1997, the year Maria became the MP for Garston and Halewood.
She was nominated for Stonewall's politician of the year award in 2008 and three years ago voted in favour of marriage equality in Britain, joking in an interview that the sisters made a point of clatifying her sexual orientation after twin Angela came out to prevent confusion.
 "I'm the only MP who has ever been outed as heterosexual. I'm not married, I'm single, so we thought we may as well just make it clear. It's an experience not many heterosexuals have, seeing their sexuality in front of their name." 
 At the end of last month she retweeted a Telegraph article  on the "political women who made waves in 2015", which included sister Angela.
When Eagle was elected to parliament in 1997 it was on the back of being made a candidate as part of an all-women shortlist.
She went on to co-publish a 30-page book/pamphlet, High Time or High Tide for Labour Women, about how the 1997 election boosted the representation of the number of women MPs in the House of Commons.

Making a Murderer depicts miscarriages of justice that are not at all rare; 
All the cloak-and-dagger undermining that happens to the Netflix series defendant is par for the course in the US criminal justice system.

Trevor Timm.

If you take one thing away from binge-watching Netflix's Making a Murderer besides sympathy for its protagonists, make it this: the events of the film, in which two men may have been framed for murder, aren't an isolated case - the criminal "justice" system actively works against innocent people and prevents justice all the time. And in many ways, that is by design.
 Related:  Making a Murderer: directors say juror told them Steven Avery was framed 
The 10-hour, 10-episode film follows the story of Steve Avery, a Wisconsin native who spent 18 years in jail after being wrongly convicted of rape in 1985. After the real culprit was found and he was exonerated, he found himself re-arrested and tried for murder in a separate case a short time later, under extremely suspicious circumstances that strongly suggest he was framed by the local sheriff's office while prosecutors looked the other way.
One of the most gut-wrenching scenes is when one of the characters, Brendan Dassey - Avery's cousin, who is a shy and sad teenager with mental difficulties - is coerced into confessing to the murder that is the subject of the majority of the documentary. His public defender briefly refers to the "Reid method" of interrogation then quickly moves on without explaining what they meant. But it's an important point.
The New Yorker published an excellent article a couple years back reporting on the highly controversial technique, which is used by police around the country despite not being based on any actual science. It turns out the method - where interrogators suggest and push events onto those they are interrogating for hours and constantly tell the suspects they are lying - is great at getting confessions but terrible at getting the truth, and it often leads to putting innocent people behind bars.
In another must-read article about the subject of false confessions, Judge Jed Rakoff explained in the New York Review of Books in 2014, "Research indicates that young, unintelligent, or risk-averse defendants will often provide false confessions just because they cannot 'take the heat' of an interrogation." He cites an expert's estimation that between 2 and 8% of all those who have pled guilty are actually innocent. Projected out over the United States's two million prisoners, that is a massive number.
Making a Murderer also examines examines the nature of plea bargains and how defendants can be forced into taking them, even if they are innocent. Just because defendants pleads guilty - even if they aren't represented by the cartoonishly evil attorney in the series, who is basically shown working for the prosecutors rather than his client - doesn't mean they did it. According to the National Registry of Exonerations, 47 of the 125 criminal exonerations in 2014 involved defendants who had originally pleaded guilty. That's over 37% of them.
Much of the murder trial depicted in Making a Murderer revolves around DNA evidence, particularly an already-discredited FBI test of evidence that is further contaminated by lab operators yet still allowed to be used against Avery. This is not an isolated, extreme case; in a bombshell admission by the government last year about its forensic hair lab, the Washington Post reported that the Justice Department and FBI "formally acknowledged that nearly every examiner in an elite FBI forensic unit gave flawed testimony in almost all [of the 268] trials in which they offered evidence against criminal defendants over more than a two-decade period before 2000".
And then there is the strong suggestion that outright framing and malicious actions by the police against Steve Avery occurred in this case. Even if the overt planting of evidence is relatively rare (and we have no way of saying how prevalent it is given how easy it is for police to get away with it), even a few bad cops can lead to a staggering number of wrongful convictions. In 2012, " researchers became aware of more than 1,100 other cases in which convictions were overturned due to 13 separate police corruption scandals, most of which involved the planting of drugs or guns on innocent defendants".
And as to how prosecutors and the police can get away with such egregious violations - that's not unique to Making a Murderer, either. In the first Avery case where he was in jail for 18 years for a crime audiences know he did not commit, prosecutors and police ignored key evidence pointing to another person and purposefully did not hand this information over to the defense. After public outcry, the state of Wisconsin decides to investigate itself. Lo and behold, the report that is written lets the perpetrators off free. This is a tried and true technique of the Justice Department and many other government agencies: investigate themselves after wrongdoing and then announce they've been exonerated. While there are countlessexamples, you can start with the FBI's own investigation into the 150 shootings its agents were involved in over more than a decade and finding the agents faultless in every single one.
All this really just scratches the surface of how our justice system - which is often described in pie-in-the-sky terms involving "innocent until proven guilty" and "truth and justice" - is so stacked against defendants that there are potentially tens of thousands of innocent people in jail right now. And in many of the cases, it's difficult or impossible to get a new trial given how much the system is meant to protect itself.
Ninth Circuit judge Alex Kozinski wrote a seminal paper on how investigators, prosecutors and courts put defendants at an extreme and unjust disadvantage just last year. Kozinski comprehensively documented the myths many people have about the justice system's fairness and how it is incredibly stacked in favor of the state while stifling defendants' basic rights. While the paper was written for a law review, it is written in a matter-of-fact style that non-lawyers will find compelling, and I encourage anyone who is interested in learning more after watching Making a Murderer to read it.

Imagine Rebekah Brooks roller-skating through the Sun newsroom...; 
Maxine Peake stars in Red Top, a TV satire that lampoons national newspapers.

Roy Greenslade.

Imagine Rebekah Brooks roller-skating through the Sun's newsroom as editorial staff, having been told to avoid making eye contact, duck below their desks.
And conjure up this image: a wheelchair-bound Rupert Murdoch locked in a room by Wendi Deng as she spends time with guitar-strumming Tony Blair.  
Closer to the home of this blog, envision the former Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger leading a news conference sing-song of the newspaper's anthem with a refrain about swinging to the left. 
These are just three of the memorable scenes from a wonderful TV satire, Red Top, to be screened later this month. 
It's a glorious, irreverent post-hacking lampoon, a fantasy set in the 1970s with flairs, moustaches and disco music, that tells the story of Rebekah, an ingenue from the north of England who, having accidentally become chief executive of News International, gets embroiled (innocently of course) in a scandal. 
At two previews, I witnessed audiences laughing aloud, and often, at the unfolding of the surreal plot and the hysterical portrayals of the main characters.
Conceived and written by Peter Richardson - with co-writers Pete Richens and Brigit Grant - it is his latest Comic Strip presentation.
Maxine Peake stars as the beguiling Brooks, the eponymous red-top, and there are a clutch of brilliant cameo performances. They include Harry Enfield as Ross Kemp, Brooks's ex-husband; Stephen Mangan as Blair; Russell Tovey as Andy Coulson; Nigel Planer as Murdoch; and Eleanor Matsuura as Wendi. 
Look out also for Johnny Vegas, Alexei Sayle, Dominic Tighe (as a subservient David Cameron) and a double role by John Sessions.
Richardson describes Red Top as a "Boogie Nights-style parallel universe with a disco soundtrack." And I agree with Gold's commissioning editor, Simon Lupton, who said: "The script is wonderfully hilarious and playful." 
Red Top is due to be shown on UKTV's channel, Gold, at 10pm on 20 January. It is not to be missed.

My New Year resolution is to help the charity sector fight back; 
2016 needs to be a year of celebration, determination and clarity on the impact we have.

Cara Evans.

In 2016, the charity sector needs to fight back and it is my New Year resolution to help. As a sector, we need to shout from the rooftops about the difference we make, telling everyone how effective and efficient we are. 2015 was not the best year for the sector : bad fundraising practice in cold calling, directors harangued for their high pay, high profile cases of charities, such as Kids Company, shutting down. We need to reclaim ground, and we need to do it on social media.
 Related:  Are charities in denial about the true harm done by fundraising scandals? 
Charities must admit where they went wrong and learn from their mistakes, but, together they need to shout about the good they do. Umbrella bodies, like the National Council for Voluntary Organisations and Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations, have tried but they only represent parts of the sector. Also, big charities are able respond individually to claims made against them. These voices only speak for a very small percentage of charities and not-for-profits. If the sector is to regain public trust, we need to collectively promote the principles and practice of our work.
For instance, most charities are run by volunteers - and the role of trustees as guardians is one that needs to be highlighted. As does the work of volunteers in running services, fundraising or campaigning - not as a replacement of staff but alongside them. This needs to be profiled. 
We need to explain how charities work. Collectively we need to say, "we have achieved X while only spending Y, the difference we have made is Z". We have to showcase our impressive achievements. I know it's easier said than done, but there are numerous organisations that can help even the smallest charities measure their impact. Just google charity evaluation and you will find a wealth of free resources and signposts to organisations that can help.
 Related:  Confessions of a charity professional - we want your blogs
Also, we need to explain how staff salaries impact on a charity's results. To achieve change the sector needs to attract good talent and pay a competitive wage. All the people I have ever worked with work extra hard, every day. They have chosen careers in organisations with social benefit - why shouldn't their efforts be rewarded with good pay? Charities do not have to apologise for paying decent salaries.
This year the charity sector has to be extra clever and resourceful. While we don't have huge amounts of advertising spend, we do have the power of social media. We need to use it, not to ask anything of people, but tell people what we do; shout about the lives we have saved, the lonely people we have made smile and the children we have helped escape a life of cruelty.
The perceptions of charities and the way charities work are changing and we have to change with it. The sector needs to showcase its good work and be clear on the values that comes with being a not-for-profit organisation.
 Related:  We need to tackle myths around charity pay and how we spend our income
Everyone in the sector needs to be reminded of how good they are. 2016 needs to be a year of celebration, joy, determination and clarity on the impact of the sector. We all have a responsibility to show the world what we do and the difference we make.
                     Confessions of a charity professional is the Guardian Voluntary Sector Network's anonymous series where charity workers tell it how it is. If you would like to pitch us an idea read our guidelines here.

Britain says suspected abduction of bookseller would be 'egregious breach' by China; 
UK foreign secretary speaks out amid speculation that British bookseller has been detained by security services.

Tom Phillips in Beijing.

The British foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, has said Beijing would be guilty of an "egregious breach" of Hong Kong's autonomy if speculation that Chinese security forces had abducted a British bookseller in the former colony was confirmed.
Lee Bo, a 65-year-old British passport-holder, disappeared in Hong Kong last Wednesday and is one of five booksellers to have vanished from the region  since October. 
The whereabouts of the men - who specialised in books critical of China's Communist party rulers - remains a mystery, with Beijing still refusing to directly comment on the scandal.
 Related:  Hong Kong politicians call for Beijing to answer over bookseller's 'abduction'
But the booksellers - who include a Swedish publisher, Gui Minhai, and three more junior bookshop staff - are widely suspected to have been detained by mainland security officials. Hong Kong police say they are investigating Lee's disappearance.
Speaking on Wednesday in Beijing, where he is on a two-day visit, Hammond admitted that British officials not made any progress in ascertaining what had happened to Lee.
"There are obviously various strands of speculation about what might have happened to him but as far as I am aware they are all pure speculation at the moment. There is no hard information available," the foreign secretary said after meeting with Yang Jiechi, China's top diplomat.
However, Hammond voiced concern that Lee's possible removal to the mainland would represent a major blow to the "one country, two systems" formula under which Hong Kong has operated with partial autonomy from Beijing since its return to China in 1997. Those rules outlaw mainland police from operating in Hong Kong and give Hong Kong judicial independence from authoritarian China.
Hammond said: "Just responding to the speculation that we've seen, it would not be acceptable for somebody to be spirited out of Hong Kong in order to face charges in a different jurisdiction. It is an essential part of the settlement in Hong Kong that it has its own judicial system and it is solely responsible for trying offences that occur in Hong Kong."
Despite those concerns, the foreign secretary played down claims that the suspected abduction by Chinese security forces would spell doom for the 'one country, two systems' principle, as a number of prominent figures in Hong Kong have claimed.
Anson Chan, Hong Kong's top civil servant at the time of handover, told the BBC : "If the abduction is proven true then I think you are spelling the death knell for 'one country, two systems'. You can forget about it. Nobody would feel safe in Hong Kong."
 Related:  Philip Hammond presses China over UK citizen among missing booksellers
Hammond said: "We need to know what has happened and who is responsible for it, both ultimately responsible and proximately responsible. [These are] not necessarily the same thing, of course. 
"But even in the worst case scenario that is being speculated, it seems to me that it would be quite an extreme step to say that because of what would be an egregious breach of the principle of 'one country, two systems' and the basic law and the Sino-British Joint Declaration... the whole thing had collapsed."
Pro-democracy activists delivered a petition to the British consulate in Hong Kong on Wednesday, urging UK authorities to pressure China for answers over the missing booksellers. They also demonstrated outside the Chinese government headquarters in Hong Kong, accusing Beijing of kidnapping the booksellers because they had dared to publish politically sensitive books.
"China thinks that it's just a matter for China," Joshua Wong, the prominent student leader, told Hong Kong broadcaster RTHK. "But I would like to say it's a matter for all citizens worldwide."
Speaking alongside Hammond on Tuesday evening, the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, appeared for the first time to confirm his government's involvement in Lee's disappearance.
He described the missing bookseller as being "first and foremost a Chinese citizen" but refused to confirm whether China had, in fact, detained the five men. "It is not necessary for anyone to make groundless speculations," Wang said.
The disappearances, two of which took place outside mainland China, in Hong Kong and Thailand, have stirred fears about what many see as Beijing's growing willingness to pursue its opponents beyond its own borders.
Asked if he could guarantee that the UK-based relatives of Lee Bo and Gui Minhai would not also disappear, Hammond said: "Certainly in the UK everybody should feel safe from being spirited anywhere. I would have a high degree of confidence that people in the UK are safe from any such activity."

Oregon standoff: memory of botched Waco siege shapes federal response; 
Vivid institutional history of the bloodshed that marked standoffs with radical rightwingers in 1990s mean federal agents are nearly invisible this time around.

Andrew Gumbel.

The shadow of Waco and other botched law enforcement sieges of the 1980s and 1990s is looming large over the standoff in south-eastern Oregon, where federal agents are avoiding anything that smacks of confrontation with the armed anti-government activists who have occupied a remote wildlife refuge since the weekend.
Where once federal law enforcement agencies might have been itching to meet the activists' defiance head-on, now they are virtually invisible - apparently believing they have much more to lose from triggering violence than they have to gain by waiting the protesters out. 
The reason, according to former federal agents and experts on rightwing extremism, is a vivid institutional memory of the bloodshed that marked standoffs with radical rightwingers in Ruby Ridge, Idaho, in 1992 and at Waco, Texas, the following year. Those operations not only led to loss of life on both sides - more than 80 people died in the fire that ended the siege of the Branch Davidian religious compound outside Waco - they also provoked scandal, investigations, congressional hearings, and years of further confrontations with radical groups outraged by the way the federal authorities behaved.  
"What we're seeing is definitely related to lessons learned at Ruby Ridge and Waco and Marion, Utah and other sieges since then," said Mark Pitcavage, director of the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism. "From a law enforcement perspective, if you try to use force to resolve the situation, there's a risk that one or more of the extremists involved may be killed and turn into martyrs. You can end up spawning far more retaliatory acts of violence than whatever harm the initial incident could have caused." 
At least one Waco veteran, an FBI hostage negotiator who has long since retired, has been hired back as a government adviser on the Oregon standoff. Another, the former head of the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team, Danny Coulson, said it was gratifying to see the bureau take what he called a "laid-back posture". 
"Less is better here," Coulson said. "Let 'em talk ... The commander on the ground should be engaging in very close dialogue with the group's leader, person to person. Sooner or later, the wives are going to get sick of the sight of their husbands screwing around out there, or they'll need to go get cigarettes. It will end the right way."
The Oregon standoff is a relatively low-stakes conflict because no shots have been fired in anger, nobody has been hurt or taken hostage and no evidence has emerged that one or more of the protesters is being sought for other offences. They could scarcely be in a more remote area, and they are occupying a building entirely devoid of strategic importance. 
Nonetheless, the feds' approach is a sea-change from the early 1990s, when a macho paramilitary culture and aggressive rules of engagement approved at the highest levels were ingrained in the FBI and contributed to disasters the bureau is now anxious never to repeat. Ruby Ridge started out as a failed attempt to lure an Idaho survivalist, Randy Weaver, into committing a gun charge so the feds would have leverage to persuade him to inform on his friends at the Aryan Nations compound down the mountain. By the time it was over, in September 1992, a US Marshal and Weaver's 14-year-old son had died in a shootout and an FBI sharpshooter had killed Weaver's wife while she cradled a 14-month-old baby in her arms. 
The Waco siege began six months later when the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) mounted an assault-style raid on the Branch Davidian compound and tried to arrest the cult leader, David Koresh. Four ATF agents and six Branch Davidians were killed. As a siege got under way, heavy-handed FBI commanders disregarded the advice of their own hostage negotiators and steadily escalated the tension - deploying military Bradley fighting vehicles, blasting the compound with high-power lights and playing everything from Tibetan chants and the sound of dying rabbits to Nancy Sinatra singing These Boots Are Made for Walkin', all at maximum volume.
With all avenues for a peaceful resolution closed, the feds moved in to end the siege by force after 51 days. A fire set by the Branch Davidian leadership as they saw the FBI coming killed almost everyone inside. Gary Noesner, one of the FBI hostage negotiators at Waco later wrote a book in which he reflected: "The harder we push, the more likely we are to be met with resistance." He said the art of managing a standoff was to apply just the right amount of pressure - not so little that the subjects gain in confidence and not so much that it triggers a firefight. 
Noesner was unavailable for interview for this story because the FBI, unusually, has called him out of retirement to advise them directly on the Oregon situation. The principle he invoked was put to good use in 1996, when a standoff with a group called the Montana Freemen ended peacefully after 81 days, and again in 1997 in a week-long drama involving hostages held by a group calling itself the Republic of Texas. Patience, not aggression, has been the watchword of law enforcement ever since. 
When a New Hampshire couple, Ed and Elaine Brown, barricaded themselves in their mountain home in 2007 rather than return to court for their sentencing hearing in a tax evasion case, state and federal law enforcement sat pat for more than six months. The couple was heavily armed with weapons and explosives and their property was effectively a mini-fortress, with an observation tower, bunkers, tunnels and booby-traps set on approaches to the house. They relied on a steady stream of supporters - including Randy Weaver - to bring them food and other supplies. Eventually, two undercover US Marshals got inside by posing as sympathizers and arrested them without incident.
In Oregon, the strategy appears to be to cut off electricity to the wildlife refuge and wait until the protesters run out of generator fuel - following Noesner's principle of applying some pressure but not too much. Coulson said the FBI would probably seek to impress on Ammon Bundy and his cohorts that a hot-headed resort to violence would be in nobody's interest. "A conversation's a hell of a lot better than a gunfight," Coulson said. 
Law enforcement's soft approach is not immune from criticism, especially when police agencies appear to treat white men with guns one way and black people and suspected Muslim extremists another. Authorities in Texas have all but given up on one heavily armed fugitive, John Joe Gray, who has been holed up on his 47-acre property south-east of Dallas since 2000. They say it's not worth risking the life of a single deputy just to make the arrest. 
There has been criticism, too, of the Bureau of Land Management's decision to back off from confiscating cattle belonging to Ammon Bundy's father, Cliven Bundy, because he has not paid grazing fees and fines on his Nevada ranch since the early 1990s. Bundy issued a call to arms in 2014 and attracted so many supporters the BLM decided the risks of enforcing the law were too great. "It's a pretty complex calculation of risks versus benefits," Pitcavage of the ADL said. Would the advantages of confiscating Cliven Bundy's cattle be worth possible casualties, or future acts of violence? "Certainly, there are negative consequences to backing down, but sometimes there are equal if not greater negative consequences in going forward."

Sex discrimination commissioner job still vacant as government continues to stall; 
Coalition says candidates have been shortlisted for role which has been empty for four months and which it claimed in October would be filled 'shortly'.

Daniel Hurst Political correspondent.

The Turnbull government has drawn up a shortlist of candidates for the next sex discrimination commissioner but is at least a month away from a decision, despite claims in October that an announcement was imminent. 
 Related:  'Have a thick skin' - sex discrimination commissioner's advice to her successor
Labor said it was "a disgrace for women everywhere" that the government was delaying appointing a replacement for Elizabeth Broderick, the long-serving commissioner whose term expired four months ago.
It is understood candidates have been shortlisted and interviews are due to be conducted soon, with cabinet likely to sign off on the appointment in mid-February.
A spokeswoman for the attorney general, George Brandis, said the recruitment process was "well under way".
"An announcement will be made shortly," the spokeswoman said on Wednesday. "Human Rights Commission president Gillian Triggs is currently acting in the role."
The opposition argued the government should have been well-prepared to fill the expected vacancy, given it extended Broderick's term by a year in 2014.
The shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, said it was disgraceful that "women suffering discrimination - in the workplace or elsewhere - have had no advocate".
"It's been more than four months now - and I'm floored that the government doesn't seem to care there Australia has no sex discrimination commissioner," he said. 
 Related:  Jamie Briggs to blame for publication of public servant's photo, says PM
Dreyfus sought to link the issue to the scandal surrounding Jamie Briggs's resignation from the ministry over "inappropriate" conduct towards a female public servant in Hong Kong in November and the subsequent leaking of a photo of the complainant.
"It's all very well to talk about tackling discrimination against women and stronger ministerial standards [but] this farce shows Malcolm Turnbull is failing on both those fronts," Dreyfus said.
Brandis's office told Fairfax Media more than three months ago that an announcement about the next commissioner would be made "shortly". The attorney general used a similar formulation in a Senate estimates hearing on 20 October, before telling the Senate on 12 November that "an announcement will be made very soon".
 Related:  Peter Dutton apologises for calling journalist a 'mad witch' in text message
The sex discrimination commissioner oversees the Human Rights Commission's efforts to overcome gender-based discrimination, including sexual harassment.
Broderick focused on five areas: balancing paid work and care; women's economic security; promoting women in leadership; preventing violence against women and sexual harassment; and strengthening gender equality laws and agencies.
In a farewell interview with Guardian Australia in September, Broderick offered advice to her successor: "Do what you can, when you can... Don't respond to the barbs. Have a thick skin."
Broderick has continued to be active , particularly in a week where a journalist was called a "mad fucking witch" by the immigration minister and a sports reporter was asked out for a drink and told "don't blush, baby" during an interview with cricketer Chris Gayle.

VW shares slide after US Department of Justice files lawsuit; 
Emissions scandal has already wiped tens of billions of euros off VW's share price.

Staff and agencies.

FRShares in Volkswagen fell after the US Justice Department sued the German automaker over emissions-cheating software fitted to diesel vehicles. 
Volkswagen's shares slumped 3.1% to (EURO)122.45 in Frankfurt trading on Tuesday morning - easily the worst performer on the DAX index, which was 0.4% higher overall.
The Justice Department's move on Monday potentially exposes the company to billions in fines for clean air violations.
 Related:  US files civil lawsuit against Volkswagen for violating clean air laws
Volkswagen set aside (EURO)6.7bn (£4.9bn) to deal with the costs of recalling and fixing cars after the scandal erupted in September, but the ultimate costs to the company are expected to be considerably higher. A number of private class-action lawsuits filed by angry VW owners is also pending.
After the regulator uncovered the scandal in September, VW admitted installing the software, which was designed to trick regulators into believing its cars were less polluting than they really were by producing low emissions only when undergoing official tests, in more than 11m vehicles across the world. 
The allegations in the lawsuit, brought on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), carry penalties that could cost Volkswagen more than $30,000 (£20,400) per vehicle, which could total as much as $18bn.
The emissions scandal has already wiped tens of billions of euros off VW's share price, and analysts have warned that the total cost of the scandal could be as high as (EURO)78bn, which would be 60% more than the Deepwater Horizon disaster cost BP.

 Trump campaign "manhandles" Bernie supporters  
The Trump campaign has kept at least two Bernie Sanders supporters from attending the rally in Burlington and "manhandled" them in the process.
Tim Farr of Burlington had waited in line since 10 AM to see Trump's appearance in his hometown. The well spoken young man was wearing a Bernie Sanders pin as was his mother. As they entered the auditorium, Farr told the Guardian that he and his mother were grabbed by Trump's security and "forcibly ejected from the building." 
Despite having a ticket to the event, Farr was told "this is a private event, only Trump supporters are allowed in." 
He said he and his mother were grabbed before they could say anything. Even though they tried to insist "we weren't here to protest, just here to see Donald Trump." It didn't matter. Farr said "we were wearing this [Bernie Sanders] pin and we were the enemy." 
Farr thought this was not "Vermont values," and never experienced anything like it before his life. He said mournfully "Bernie would allow Trump supporters in his evens." Farr stayed outside the rally to protest in frustration. However, his mother went home in tears.
He also told the Guardian that he was still considering whether or not to file a police report for simple assault.
The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

This week was a jarring reminder of what's at stake in 2016. For the first time ever, the United States House and Senate passed a bill to defund Planned Parenthood and repeal the Affordable Care Act. Thankfully, President Obama will exercise his veto power to stop the Republicans from cutting off women, men, and young people from vital health care services at Planned Parenthood-including cancer screenings, well-woman exams, and STI and HIV tests-and taking away health coverage from 18 million people. Any of the Republican candidates will proudly sign that bill into law if they win. We can't let that happen.

In fact, he wouldn't be the first to observe the strange phenomenon of Trump/Sanders support crossover.

 Hillary Clinton has had it with your selfie sticks. 
In an interview with Esquire Magazine, the Democratic frontrunner decried "the tyranny of the selfie" as hampering her ability to connect with voters in real life, as opposed to just their Instagram feeds.
It used to be - and I was talking to President Obama about this the other day - it used to be that you would do an event like this and then you would shake hands with people and they would talk to you. They would say, 'I liked what you said about this' or 'You didn't mention that' or 'Can I tell you this?' And it was a constant learning and absorbing experience.
Now, it's just 'Can I take a selfie? Can I take a picture?' People just want to capture that moment, and I just try to be accommodating.
Clinton isn't so distressed by the ubiquity of camera phones that she won't oblige requests for a close-up, however - when told that she has a skill for taking artful selfies, the former secretary of state said, "That's what people ask for. If I'm going to try to get to everybody, I have to be good at it."

IAAF in crisis: a complex trail of corruption that led to the very top; 
One man's decision to speak out over Liliya Shobukhova blackmail case exposed athletics' rotten core and led to the suspensions handed down by the IAAF.

Sean Ingle.

The biggest scandal in athletics history started to slowly unfurl over drinks at a crowded Japanese hotel bar in February 2014. It was the night before the Tokyo Marathon but the Russian sports agent Andrey Baranov was troubled by something much deeper than his athletes' chances. When Sean Wallace-Jones, a senior IAAF official he knew and trusted, sat next to him, he ushered him into a quiet corner and told him: "I need your help."
Tentatively, Baranov began to reveal fragments of an extraordinary story involving doping, extortion and corruption. As he explained to a shocked Wallace-Jones, his athlete Liliya Shobukhova - the second fastest female marathon runner in history and a winner of the London Marathon in 2010 - had given (EURO)450,000 (£335,000) to senior Russian officials in exchange for covering up violations in her athlete biological passport.
 Related:  IAAF bans four senior officials over alleged doping cover-ups 
That decision to speak out - at considerable risk to Baranov's safety - led directly to the decision on Thursday by the International Association of Athletics Federations' ethics commission to hand life bans to Papa Massata Diack, a former IAAF marketing executive and the son of the former president Lamine, along with Valentin Balakhnichev, the former president of the Russian athletics federation and IAAF treasurer, and Alexei Melnikov, the former chief coach for Russian endurance athletes. Meanwhile Gabriel DollÈ, the most senior anti-doping official in track and field until 2014, was given a five-year ban.
The commission's verdict was direct and damning. It found the four men had "acted dishonestly and corruptly and did unprecedented damage to the sport of track and field... [having] conspired to extort what were in substance bribes from the athlete by acts of blackmail".
But without the persistence of Wallace-Jones the deep rottenness at the heart of the sport may never have been exposed. Immediately after meeting Baranov in Tokyo, he phoned DollÈ to ask him for clarification. DollÈ was hesitant and suggested they should chat when they were both back at the IAAF's headquarters in Monaco. When they did so over lunch a few days later, DollÈ was guarded. But Wallace-Jones kept digging. He alerted several other senior figures to Baranov's story, including the IAAF's deputy general secretary Nick Davies, and tried to arrange a meeting with the president of the IAAF, Lamine Diack. But it was slow going.
Another month, another meeting, another bar. On 28 March, Baranov and Wallace-Jones again found themselves drinking in a hotel - this time, the Marriott in Copenhagen - on the eve of the world half-marathon championships. Now, though, they were joined by Dave Bedford, the legendary former 10,000m world record holder and chairman of the IAAF's road running commission. After hearing Baranov's story, he urged the pair to report what they knew to the IAAF's newly established independent ethics commission. Bedford trusted its head Michael Beloff QC, one of the world's leading sports lawyers, to find the truth.
At that meeting Baranov made a second stunning revelation: that some IAAF officials were involved in extorting money. As he explained, Shobukhova had been asked to accept a suspension in exchange for getting a (EURO)300,000 refund. The money was transferred to her husband's bank account from a company in Singapore called Black Tidings, which was linked to Papa Massata Diack. Baranov also insisted that at least one other IAAF senior figure, Balakhnichev, had knowledge of the arrangement.
Two days later, on 30 March, Wallace-Jones finally got to hear from Diack directly. But the meeting left him frustrated. As Wallace-Jones told the ethics commission, Diack "immediately told me that the accusations were untrue and that if there was any truth then they would be investigated."
Wallace-Jones was unconvinced. "I told him that I believed that there was considerable circumstantial evidence and that investigation was certainly called for," he says. "He then proceeded to tell me about his relationship with his son Papa Massata, saying how difficult it had been and how they had not spoken for many years and that there had been a lot of resentment from his son as he was rarely at home due to his political and sporting commitments."
Baranov and Wallace-Jones continued to talk, both in person and on Facebook, piecing together what they knew like detectives. Finally it was time to act. On 12 April 2014, the day before the London Marathon, the men signed a sworn deposition and sent it by courier to Beloff's office alleging corruption at the highest level of athletics' governing body.
Corruption is not new in international sport, of course. But this went beyond financial embezzlement and bribes and directly on to the field of play. The actions of senior IAAF and Russian officials meant that Shobukhova was allowed to compete when she should have been banned because of huge anomalies in her biological passport.
As Beloff started quietly to go about his business, Shobukhova decided she wasn't going to pay any more bribes and was banned from athletics in the spring of 2014. For several months the story went quiet, then in December 2014 it exploded. First the German documentary maker Hajo Seppelt revealed widespread doping in Russian athletics. Then the French newspaper L'…quipe revealed that senior figures had extorted money from Shobukhova, which led Papa Massata Diack and Balakhnichev to step down from their IAAF positions. Then the Guardian revealed that DollÈ had left his post as the medical and anti-doping director because of the Shobukhova case.
Initially when we put this to the IAAF, we were told that DollÈ had "retired after more than 20 years with the IAAF - he is 73 years old and the normal retirement age in Monaco is 65 so he was actually overdue to step down". It was only when we insisted that sources had told us that DollÈ had been questioned by the ethics commission that it reluctantly confirmed the news. On Thursday the IAAF's ethics commission banned DollÈ for five years for failing to ensure action was taken to suspend Shobukhova.
Most of the juiciest pieces of the report were already in the public domain. But buried in the appendices were interesting titbits and further potential time bombs - including a revelation that there was strong prima facie evidence against Habib CissÈ, Lamine Diack's legal adviser who is now being scrutinised by the ethics commission, along with Diack himself. The case against DollÈ too, the report noted, might be reopened depending on the results of a French police investigation into whether he took bribes.
Other details also raised eyebrows. The IAAF's anti-doping department thought it "unusual and inappropriate" when CissÈ was brought in to personally scrutinise Russian athletes' biological passport cases "despite having never previously been involved in any case at the result management level" - yet did nothing about it. Huw Roberts tried to quit from his legal position because the IAAF sat on six cases of Russian biological passport violations, but stayed on because Diack refused to accept his resignation.
The report was particularly damning about the behaviour of Russian and IAAF officials. Shobukhova's signature was forged onto an "acceptance of sanction" form just before Russian Athletics imposed a ban on her. And while her story was "entirely consistent", Balakhnichev and Melnikov's account was "riddled with implausibilities, inconsistencies, transparent lies and dubious documents", and Papa Massata Diack's version was considered to be "lacking in any plausibility".

Many in track and field continue to doubt Baranov and Shobhukhova's motives in coming forward, given that his roster of athletes contains several with chequered pasts while she is a confirmed drugs cheat. But Baranov insists Shobukhova deserves great credit for revealing all to the ethics commission and helping the World Anti-Doping Agency. As he told the Guardian : Shobukhova was a "product of a system which was exposed by Wada" where athletes were encouraged to dope or were frozen out. "Liliya was also brave to speak out. Not many people know what she did or what she went through."
Baranov also admitted to the Guardian that he still fears the repercussions from speaking out. "Of course I am worried but what are you going to do?" he says. "It had to be done for the future."
And the Russians have a staunch ally in Bedford, a strong anti-doping campaigner during nearly half a century as an athlete and administrator. "As horrible and sordid as this case is, our sport is in a better position now knowing this is happened than if it had been pushed under the carpet," says Bedford. "And as a sport we have to give credit to Baranov, Shobukhova, and Wallace-Jones who bought this to the ethics commission."
But there is no hiding the fact that Thursday was another desperate day for track and field. And athletics' reputation is likely to suffer an even greater battering next Thursday when Dick Pound publishes a follow-up report into IAAF corruption, which he says will contain "a wow factor". Given a French police investigation into several former IAAF figures is also ongoing, those still left on athletics' rickety ship must yearn for a moment when they are not being buffeted by wretched storms and scandals.

In a statement just now, Clinton said she that she was "honored" to have the group's endorsement. 
She continued:
There has never been a more important election when it comes to women's health and reproductive rights-and Planned Parenthood's patients, providers, and advocates across the country are a crucial line of defense against the dangerous agenda being advanced by every Republican candidate for president.
This week was a jarring reminder of what's at stake in 2016. For the first time ever, the United States House and Senate passed a bill to defund Planned Parenthood and repeal the Affordable Care Act. Thankfully, President Obama will exercise his veto power to stop the Republicans from cutting off women, men, and young people from vital health care services at Planned Parenthood-including cancer screenings, well-woman exams, and STI and HIV tests-and taking away health coverage from 18 million people. Any of the Republican candidates will proudly sign that bill into law if they win. We can't let that happen.

In fact, he wouldn't be the first to observe the strange phenomenon of Trump/Sanders support crossover.

Hot Air chalks it up to the "blue collar coalition" both candidates are developing; moreover, Sanders has in the past publicly appealed to Trump supporters to back him instead, and even instructed his canvassers with specific scripts to lure Trump supporters.
Though, in this particular instance, Ben says the Bernie badge-wearers are as likely to be messing with Trump than genuinely supporting him as a second choice. But who knows - maybe once they hear him speak later on they'll find themselves convinced.

 Hillary Clinton has had it with your selfie sticks. 
In an interview with Esquire Magazine, the Democratic frontrunner decried "the tyranny of the selfie" as hampering her ability to connect with voters in real life, as opposed to just their Instagram feeds.
It used to be - and I was talking to President Obama about this the other day - it used to be that you would do an event like this and then you would shake hands with people and they would talk to you. They would say, 'I liked what you said about this' or 'You didn't mention that' or 'Can I tell you this?' And it was a constant learning and absorbing experience.
Now, it's just 'Can I take a selfie? Can I take a picture?' People just want to capture that moment, and I just try to be accommodating.
Clinton isn't so distressed by the ubiquity of camera phones that she won't oblige requests for a close-up, however - when told that she has a skill for taking artful selfies, the former secretary of state said, "That's what people ask for. If I'm going to try to get to everybody, I have to be good at it."

Had he entered the race, Biden seems to think that he would have had his work cut out for him, calling the state of the Republican field "absolutely crazy."

Era of climate science denial is not over, study finds; 
Conservative thinktanks in the US engaging in climate change have increased their attacks on science in recent years, a study of 16,000 documents finds..

Graham Readfearn.

Is organised climate science denial finished?
After global heat records were continually broken over the last decade, and as sea levels rose and scientists reported the accelerated melting of polar ice sheets, you might be forgiven for thinking the debate over climate change had shifted.
No more arguing over the science? It's more about the policy now, right?
Well, wrong. At least according to a new study that has looked at 15 years worth of output from 19 conservative "thinktanks" in the United States.
"We find little support for the claim that 'the era of science denial is over' - instead, discussion of climate science has generally increased over the sample period," the study concludes. 
The conservative thinktanks under the microscope are the main cog in the machinery of climate science denial across the globe, pushing a constant stream of material into the public domain.
The study, published in the journal Global Environmental Change, analysed more than 16,000 documents published online between 1998 and 2013 by mainly US groups like the Heartland Institute, the Cato Institute and the American Enterprise Institute.
Contrary to some commentators, the study found attacks on science had increased in later years. At the same time, the thinktanks were focusing less on policy issues.
To come to that conclusion authors Dr Travis Coan, of the University of Exeter, and Dr Constantine Boussalis, of Trinity College Dublin, analysed 8300 articles, 3000 reports, 100 interview transcripts, 680 open letters and press releases and 3400 "scientific" reviews.
So did the result surprise them? Coan told me:
 One the one hand, we were aware that many in both the media and academia believed that science denial was on the decline. However, this didn't fit with our casual reading of the skeptical literature and thus a major impetus of the paper was to put this idea to the test.  Though, with that said, we were a bit surprised by the 'rise': my prior expectation was that the denial of science and policy, at least on average, has remained relatively constant. This does not appear to be the case. 
Not only had the attacks on science increased but thinktanks had also ramped up their climate change output in recent years, the study found.
But was it possible the study's clear declaration that "the era of climate science denial is not over" might no longer stand, given that the study period ended in August 2013?
After all, since then we have seen the record for the hottest year on record broken twice and, for the first time, more than 190 nations agreeing in Paris to keep global warming to "well below 2C".
Coan agreed this was "certainly possible", but "there are also reasons to speculate that the trend has continued." He said:
 We are currently working on a study with John Cook that looks at science and policy related themes (amongst other items) in the top 50 climate skeptic blogs through 2015. The topic structure (i.e. discourse) is very similar, and sometimes identical, to the conservative thinktanks and there is reason to think that these two time series move together. For the blogs, we find that the increase in science-related skepticism continues right through 2015. Again, these results are preliminary, but suggest that the 'end of science denial' - at least among these actors - might be wishful thinking. 
The study explained these thinktanks "provide a multitude of services to the cause of climate change scepticism". These included:

offering material support and lending credibility to contrarian scientists
sponsoring pseudo-scientific climate change conferences
directly communicating contrarian viewpoints to politicians
disseminating sceptic viewpoints through a range of media
Many of the 19 thinktanks analysed in the study have in the past accepted funding from fossil fuel interests, such as oil giant Exxon and the billionaire Koch brothers. 
In October 2015 a study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) found thinktanks that had taken corporate funding from the likes of Exxon and the Kochs were more likely to produce material designed to polarise the climate change issue.
Exxon is currently facing an investigation from the New York attorney general into whether it lied to the public and investors about the risks of human-caused climate change.
Dr Justin Farrell, the author of the PNAS study, told me he was pleased to see more research into conservative thinktanks.
"We are still years away from fully understanding the extent of contrarian influence on climate change politics during the last 20 years," he said.
The latest study seems to show that thinktanks began to concentrate more on attacking the science in around 2003 but it took until about 2010 for science attacks to overtake policy discussions. But why did this happen?
One possible reason, speculates Coan, is the effect of the 2009 illegal hacking of climate scientist's emails from a server at the University of East Anglia.
While subsequent investigations found no wrongdoing, conservative thinktanks and commentators ran hard with the "scandal" - and some still do - claiming scientists were part of a grand conspiracy to deceive the world.
Dr Aaron McCright, of Michigan State University, who studies climate science denial, said the rising attacks on science appeared to have coincided with the election of Democrat Barack Obama as US president in late 2008. He said:
 The Right no longer controlled the Executive Branch or Congress... at least for the first few years of the Obama Administration.. and thus no longer had as much power inside the government to block climate change policy as they did under George W. Bush. So, they - and a considerable part of industry - ramped up denial activism after 2008 to the high levels we have seen since. 
McCright said the "denial machine" had since expanded from think tanks to include bloggers and fake grassroots campaigns and was now "more diverse and seemingly ubiquitous."
He said conservative think tanks had influenced the public's understanding of climate change and the way policymakers had reacted to it, in two ways. 
First, he said in recent decades US Republicans had used thinktank materials in committee meetings and hearings "to justify inaction on climate change".
Second, thinktank materials had been taken up as the standard talking points for conservatives.
"Indeed, I would argue that anti-environmentalism - and climate change denial more specifically - has become a central tenet of the current conservative and Republican identity."
Dr Riley Dunlap, of the Oklahoma State University, and who has partnered with McCright on several influential studies, told me:
 While conservative thinktanks were involved in denial from the outset - 1989 at least - we have argued they really moved to the forefront in the late 90s when BP and then other companies pulled out of the industry-led Global Climate Coalition that had arguably been the most powerful force in denial. In fact, the conservative thinktanks were upset that oil companies were 'caving in' to the IPCC, and decided to take the lead. This also really shifted the basis of denial from economic self-interest to ideological opposition - the commitment to neoliberalism's distaste for all government regulations. 
McCright added that "knowing what is going on is one thing" but knowing what to do about it was more challenging. I'll leave you with his thoughts.
 Opposing policy is one thing. Undermining, denying, obfuscating, etc. science is another. I wish I had a powerful, simple solution to counter the climate change denial movement, but I don't. Nevertheless, at the very least, we can continue to drag them from the shadows and into the bright light of day, vigilantly document their activities, and regularly call them out over what they are doing.

And in a third which we promise will not become a fourth consecutive Trump post, the Republican frontrunner is out with a new web spot seeking to trash Hillary Clinton by revisiting the sex scandals of Bill Clinton -  culminating with a picture of Hillary Clinton next to Bill Cosby. Aie. 
A rape allegation against Bill Clinton from 1978 resurfaced on Wednesday, when the accuser, Juanita Broaddrick, tweeted:
enltrI was 35 years old when Bill Clinton, Ark. Attorney General raped me and Hillary tried to silence me. I am now 73....it never goes away.

Vox got in touch with Broaddrick, who was quoted as saying:
I guess it was just seeing them on TV so much now, and her with the Benghazi [hearing]."
Speaking of Cosby, who has been accused of drugging and sexually abusing many women, Congressman Paul Gosar is to hold a news conference this afternoon to promote legislation due to be introduced this week affirming a mechanism for Cosby to be stripped of the presidential Medal of Freedom.

 Trump calls for 45% tariff on Chinese goods  
Economists have criticized Donald Trump's big idea for big new tariffs on Chinese goods as potentially destructive to the world economy and as founded on the mistaken notion, which Trump often repeats, that China has conducted a long-term currency manipulation effort to undercut American manufacturers.
Today Trump put a number on his tariff proposal - and it is YUUUUUUGE. 45%, he tells the Times:

 Cruz 'birther' controversy burbles  
Ted Cruz was born in Canada to a US-citizen mother and a Cuban father. Does that make him a "natural-born citizen," as the constitution requires for presidents?

More interesting than the question, perhaps, are the identities of the political leaders asking the question, who include not only Cruz's Republican rivals for the presidential nomination, but also Republican senator and former presidential nominee John McCain, who said on an Arizona radio show that "there is a question" on whether Cruz was eligible to be president. "It's worth looking into," McCain said.

Hello and welcome to our rolling coverage of the day in US politics. This ought to be a doozy.
 Bill Clinton is running around Iowa on behalf of Hillary Clinton, and Donald Trump is fronting on Bernie Sanders by holding a rally this evening in Sanders' hometown of Burlington, Vermont. Our political reporter Ben Jacobs will be on the ground.
(Why can't we get a Trump v Sanders debate out of this otherwise historically splendid election cycle? Think of the ragefun. Except a debate between the two might not work, given that they have so many policy positions in common. Maybe a televised tea summit.)
For those of you after tips on faxing, good news: a new batch of Hillary Clinton state department emails is scheduled to drop this evening. 
Also tonight! Barack Obama on guns, in the form of a televised town hall. We'll be watching that closely. On Tuesday he announced new executive actions to impose restrictions on some gun sales, prompting much wailing and gnashing of teeth on the right.
On Capitol Hill, House speaker Paul Ryan has held his first news conference of the New Year, and Congress will consider legislation to strip Bill Cosby of his presidential medal of freedom.
Best of all, Republicans are ganging up to give Ted Cruz grief about being born in Canada, in an attack started by Trump - who else - at the weekend, which was joined today by Senator John McCain and others.

UK's record car sales driven by rising consumer confidence; 
Motorists purchased 2.63m new cars last year, which represents a 6.3% increase compared with 2014.

Graham Ruddick.

New car sales reached an all-time high in Britain in 2015 as improving consumer confidence, wage growth and low-interest finance deals from manufacturers boosted the market. 
A total of 2.63m new cars hit the UK's roads an increase of 6.3% on 2014 and above the previous record of 2.58m, set in 2003.
The head of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), which provided the figures, said the British market ha d a remarkable period of growth. 
New car sales in December were also a record, rising by 8.4% year-on-year to 180,077 vehicles. Sales rose despite a 0.4% fall for Volkswagen, the third-biggest brand in the country behind Ford and Vauxhall, as customers turned against the carmaker after the diesel emissions scandal.
It is only the fourth time UK car sales have surpassed 2.5m in a calendar year. Sales have risen for four consecutive years, although analysts warned the market could be flat in 2016.
Car sales have been boosted by the improving health of the UK economy, but also by manufacturers offering attractive finance deals as they try to maintain the volume of vehicles they sell and keep their factories running. A slowdown in sales in other parts of Europe has made the UK a key market for vehicle manufacturers.
Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said: "The new car market defied expectations in 2015, hitting an all-time record driven by strong consumer and business confidence. Buyers took advantage of attractive finance deals and low inflation to secure some of the most innovative, hi-tech and fuel efficient vehicles ever produced. 
"The past four years have seen a remarkable period of sustained growth, and the outlook remains positive with every reason to expect the market to hold broadly steady in 2016."
Last year also saw record figures for Britain's biggest carmaker, Jaguar Land Rover, which achieved record UK sales of more than 100,000.
JLR said sales in the country rose 22% to 100,787, making the UK the biggest market for the luxury carmaker. The company reported strong sales of the Jaguar XE and XF as well as the Range Rover Sport and Range Rover Evoque.
The UK performance is a big boost for the carmaker as it faces a slowdown in China. Jeremy Hicks, managing director of JLR UK, said: "Selling over 100,000 cars in a year is a remarkable achievement for the Jaguar Land Rover business and our retailer partners. We have our strongest, most exciting product lineup to date and a single-minded focus to get these amazing cars to more customers than ever."
McLaren Automotive, the sports car division of the Formula One team, also had a record year. Worldwide car sales rose to 1,654, prompting the company to announce it is hiring 250 staff and launching a second production shift at its manufacturing complex in Woking.
Sajid Javid, the business secretary, visited McLaren on Thursday. He said: "McLaren road cars are some of the most iconic in the world and that is down to the excellence of British design, engineering and manufacturing. The news that it is creating 250 new jobs is a sign that the UK auto industry continues to thrive."
The Ford Fiesta remains the most popular car in Britain, with 133,434 sold in 2015. The Vauxhall Corsa is in second place, followed by the Ford Focus, Volkswagen Golf and Nissan Qashqai.
Sales of petrol cars grew faster than their diesel counterparts, meaning petrol reclaimed its position as the market leader. A total of 48.8% of the new cars sold last year are fuelled by petrol, with diesel accounting for 48.5%. Alternatively fuelled cars, such as electric and hybrid models, grew 40.3% to account for 2.8% of the market. 
Howard Archer, chief European and UK economistof IHS, the analysis and forecasting group, said falling petrol prices could help car sales grow further in 2016, despite the record performance in 2015.
"The economic fundamentals still look largely healthy for the motor industry, which will hopefully allow car sales to hold up at an elevated level over 2016,. Car sales will also likely to continue to be buoyed by attractive offers and finance packages. Furthermore, low petrol prices can only help matters," he said.
"One potential concern for the car industry is that increasing uncertainties over the economic outlook could cause fleet operators to be more cautious in their purchases of new vehicles."

Snooper's charter would be out of date in five years, says defence industry; 
Draft investigatory powers bill scrutiny committee warned by security and defence companies as 'big five' US web giants urge home secretary to rethink law.

Alan Travis Home affairs editor.

The accelerating pace of technology means the government's landmark snooper's charter bill will only have a limited shelf life and will need to be revisited within five years, Britain's defence and security industry has told MPs and peers.
They have warned that there are serious questions over whether fundamental parts of the new law that will overhaul of surveillance powers will be relevant in the near future as the technological landscape changes.  
The new draft investigatory powers bill is the first major overhaul of Britain's surveillance laws for 15 years, and follows the disclosure of the scale of mass digital surveillance by whistleblower Edward Snowden.
 Related:  'Snooper's charter' will cost British lives, MPs are warned
"The first smartphone was only introduced eight years ago, but they are now ubiquitous," says the submission from the British aerospace, defence, security and space industries to the parliamentary scrutiny committee on the draft investigatory powers bill.
"Increasingly, communications service providers simply act as 'dumb pipes', transferring data that they cannot process or understand.
"This does not mean the legislation is not viable or needs revolutionary change. It simply means that it is likely to have a shelf life. There are likely to be such significant shifts in the technological landscape over the next few years ... that it will be necessary to revise the law again in the not too distant future." 
The warning came as Google, Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo and Microsoft joined forces to urge the home secretary, Theresa May, to reconsider substantial parts of the proposed new surveillance law.
They argue it will have far-reaching implications for the rest of the world as other countries emulate its requirements of the global technology industry.
The criticism follows a warning from Apple in its submission that the new law could paralyse much of the technology sector and even lead to "serious international conflicts".

Their submissions are among 1,000 pages of written evidence published by the scrutiny committee, which reveal for the first time the wide spectrum of criticism of key provisions of the draft laws that will allow the security agencies to track every citizen's web and phone use.
The criticisms include serious concern from the United Nations that the bill's provisions "unduly interfere with the rights to privacy, freedom of opinion and expression... both inside and outside the United Kingdom" to demands from the Local Government Association that local councils must not be excluded from access to individuals' communications data. 
Vodafone, the UK telecoms company, said the government's bill risked "significantly undermining trust" and rejected any move to require them to hand over data passing over their networks from outside the UK,.
The criticism from the Silicon Valley internet giants is perhaps the most serious for Home Office ministers as it was their rejection of proposed British government requests to require them to hand over their customers' confidential web data which lay behind the Liberal Democrats' veto of the last snooper's charter bill in 2012.
The American web companies in particular have mounted strong campaigns to regain their customers' trust in the wake of Snowden's disclosures of the bulk data-collection programmes conducted by Britain's GCHQ and the US's NSA.
 Related:  Surveillance Q&A: what web data is affected - and how to foil the snoopers
Their concerns include:
∑ Rather than requiring web companies to choose which country's laws to violate, the US companies back a new international agreement to resolve these conflicts, as recommended by former UK ambassador to Washington Sir Nigel Sheinwald
∑ As a general rule, users should be told when the security agencies seek access to their data, tracking their web and phone use, except in cases involving public safety and to preserve the integrity of a criminal investigation
∑ They reject demands for weaker encryption to allow the security agencies and the police access to their services
∑ They say, in particular, cooperating with British state computer hacking of their users' phones, tablets and computers would "be a very dangerous precedent to set" and would undermine trust in their technology.
The home secretary has described the draft bill as a significant departure from her previous attempt to introduce communications data legislation and has said its safeguards and oversight protections will be the strongest anywhere in the democratic world.

 Hillary Clinton has had it with your selfie sticks. 
In an interview with Esquire Magazine, the Democratic frontrunner decried "the tyranny of the selfie" as hampering her ability to connect with voters in real life, as opposed to just their Instagram feeds.
It used to be - and I was talking to President Obama about this the other day - it used to be that you would do an event like this and then you would shake hands with people and they would talk to you. They would say, 'I liked what you said about this' or 'You didn't mention that' or 'Can I tell you this?' And it was a constant learning and absorbing experience.
Now, it's just 'Can I take a selfie? Can I take a picture?' People just want to capture that moment, and I just try to be accommodating. 
Clinton isn't so distressed by the ubiquity of camera phones that she won't oblige requests for a close-up, however - when told that she has a skill for taking artful selfies, the former secretary of state said, "That's what people ask for. If I'm going to try to get to everybody, I have to be good at it."

 Always the bridesmaid, never the bride, Vice President Joe Biden told a Connecticut television station that he has regretted not running for president "every day" since his October announcement in the Rose Garden that he had run out of the time "necessary to mount a winning campaign for the nomination."
But despite his absence in the relatively small Democratic field, Biden told WVIT in Connecticut, the Democratic party still has "two good candidates" in play - apparently referring to former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, although former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley may still hold out hope that he made Biden's cut.
Had he entered the race, Biden seems to think that he would have had his work cut out for him, calling the state of the Republican field "absolutely crazy."
"I promise you, I've spoken to three of the presidential potential nominees on the Republican side who tell me, 'Joe, it's crazy'," Biden said.

 Johnson joins race on Libertarian ticket  
The presidential field is supposed to be winnowing. Instead it just got more crowded - Gary Johnson, the former New Mexico governor, announced yesterday that he would seek the presidential nomination of the Libertarian Party. 
Jeb Lund raises an eyebrow writing in Comment Is Free: 
In an exclusive interview with Reason on Wednesday, former New Mexico governor and former Republican Gary Johnson announced that he will again seek the Libertarian party presidential nomination in order to, among other things, ban Muslim women from wearing burqas. 
Are we France now? Do we tell Lafayette that we are here ?
I'm not a Libertarian, but I'm familiar with the schtick: its purpose in American politics is to decouple the Republican goal of ending taxation on the wealthy and eliminating pro-labor regulation from the party's sex policing, religious outrage and marginal-group "othering" that makes Republicans actually electable.

Hello and welcome to our rolling coverage of the day in US politics. This ought to be a doozy.
 Bill Clinton is running around Iowa on behalf of Hillary Clinton, and Donald Trump is fronting on Bernie Sanders by holding a rally this evening in Sanders' hometown of Burlington, Vermont. Our political reporter Ben Jacobs will be on the ground.
(Why can't we get a Trump v Sanders debate out of this otherwise historically splendid election cycle? Think of the ragefun. Except a debate between the two might not work, given that they have so many policy positions in common. Maybe a televised tea summit.)
For those of you after tips on faxing, good news: a new batch of Hillary Clinton state department emails is scheduled to drop this evening. 
Also tonight! Barack Obama on guns, in the form of a televised town hall. We'll be watching that closely. On Tuesday he announced new executive actions to impose restrictions on some gun sales, prompting much wailing and gnashing of teeth on the right.
On Capitol Hill, House speaker Paul Ryan has held his first news conference of the New Year, and Congress will consider legislation to strip Bill Cosby of his presidential medal of freedom.
Best of all, Republicans are ganging up to give Ted Cruz grief about being born in Canada, in an attack started by Trump - who else - at the weekend, which was joined today by Senator John McCain and others.
It's trolly Thursday! Thanks for joining us.

UK's record car sales driven by rising consumer confidence; 
Motorists purchased 2.63m new cars last year, which represents a 6.3% increase compared with 2014.

Graham Ruddick.

New car sales reached an all-time high in Britain in 2015 as improving consumer confidence, wage growth and low-interest finance deals from manufacturers boosted the market.  
A total of 2.63m new cars hit the UK's roads an increase of 6.3% on 2014 and above the previous record of 2.58m, set in 2003.
The head of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), which provided the figures, said the British market ha d a remarkable period of growth.
New car sales in December were also a record, rising by 8.4% year-on-year to 180,077 vehicles. Sales rose despite a 0.4% fall for Volkswagen, the third-biggest brand in the country behind Ford and Vauxhall, as customers turned against the carmaker after the diesel emissions scandal.
It is only the fourth time UK car sales have surpassed 2.5m in a calendar year. Sales have risen for four consecutive years, although analysts warned the market could be flat in 2016.

 Summary  
The third Republican debate is over. Here's what we learned:

There were tricky questions for Marco Rubio, the senator from Florida, about missing a lot of votes in Congress, for Ted Cruz, the senator from Texas, about his contrarianism... and one about fantasy football that Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, spiked in the end zone. "We are 19tn in debt, we have Isis and al-Qaeda attacking us, and we're talking about fantasy football?!" he exclaimed.
Cruz got cheers for attacking the media, successfully turning the crowd against the moderators by saying the quality of the questions was "why the American people don't trust the media". The moderators' performance was also decried afterward by Reince Priebus, the national Republican chairman, on Twitter.
The crowd booed one moderator for pressing Ben Carson, the retired pediatric neurosurgeon, on whether his appearance on the web site of a company later accused of false advertising did not reflect badly on his judgment. Carson said he had nothing to do with the company.
It emerged through fact-checking, however, that Carson had in fact performed in a video for the company. The episode was representative of an uneven night for the doctor.
Rubio repeatedly turned tricky questions into strong applause lines. Pressed on having to liquidate a retirement fund even after a $1m book deal, Rubio quipped: "And I used it to pay off my loans. And it's available in paperback!"
Jeb Bush stumbled in trying to attack Rubio for not showing up for work in the Senate, and reverted to flat stump speech-talk when he got a chance to talk about his economic plan.
Donald Trump, the erstwhile frontrunner, turned in an uncharacteristically short-winded performance, denied ever having made a criticism of Rubio that was printed on his website and used his closing statement to brag about having held the debate to two hours instead of three.
Everyone from the audience to the moderators to the candidates to the online audience seemed thankful to Trump for that.
The other four candidates - former tech CEO Carly Fiorina, Ohio governor John Kasich, Senator Rand Paul and governor Mike Huckabee - seemed to hold their places without breaking through. The possible exception was Kasich, who had a couple persuasive moments of exasperation at the "fantasy" plans for entitlements and immigration presented by his rivals.

Mike Huckabee was the first one to mention the blimp that came free from its mooring in Maryland today and drifted to Pennsylvania before it was eventually grounded, writes Adam Gabbatt.

"If you saw that blimp that got cut loose in Maryland today, it's the perfect example of government," he said.
Unfortunately for Huckabee, his own metaphor had even more in common with the blimp. Just as the military lost control of its gaseous vessel, Huckabee quickly lost control of his analogy. Soon his rather hot-aired trope was drifting around without direction or purpose, before eventually flopping to the ground.
"What we had was something the government made, basically a bag of gas, that got cut loose, destroyed everything in its path, left thousands of people powerless, but they couldn't get rid of it because we had too much money invested in it." 
He added bafflingly: "So we had to keep it."

 Dominic Rushe  and Jana Kasperkevic  of the Guardian's business desk were here to cast their keen eyes over the economic aspects of the debate. Here's what they thought:
 Dominic Rushe: 
So... lovely as it is to spend the evening with you Jana, that was a bit crap wasn't it? The main event was better than the kiddie table warm-up and - for such a busy debate - there was some fairly substantive stuff on taxes, on hl-B visas and a few digs at the Fed (stay with me)... but minimum wage? No. Women's wages? "I love my mom, government's bad, OK?" 
Where was the debate on free trade? I miss Trump saying "China". Pretty lame really for a debate labelled: "Your Money, Your Vote." 
There were more mentions of "middle-class" in the warm-up. And they should have bumped Lindsey Graham up to first class. I was surprised that the crowd got so angry given that very few of the questions really struck a nerve.
 Jana Kasperkevic:  
I, too, missed Lindsey Graham. You know what else I missed? Serious questions about people's money. There was too much talk about tax plans. All people want to hear is: "I will tax the rich. I will not tax you. In fact, I will cut your taxes." Anything other than that and people's eyes glaze over. I know mine did. 
Here are the questions CNBC should have asked: 
Do you think $7.25 is high enough for a federal minimum wage?
Could you survive on about $15,000 a year?
Do you know the average age of a minimum wage worker in America?
Nine of the candidates on that stage are millionaires. Ask them: what do you think you and other millionaires should be paying in taxes?
Ask candidates with children like Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz - are you worried about paying for your kids' college? How will you do it? 
Ask Carly Fiorina how it felt to be one of the first female CEO? What advice would she give to average American women about asking for a raise? After all, in 2014, US women earned 79 cents for every dollar that men did. 
And why not ask Fiorina about the 30,000 people she laid off at HP? Does she ever think about them?

It was the Republicans' big night, but it was Hillary Clinton's name we kept hearing, reports Lauren Gambino, who is on the campaign trail with the Democratic frontrunner  in Bartlett, New Hampshire. 
While the top 10 polling Republicans take center stage in Boulder, the Democratic frontrunner is watching the debate - and live texting her reactions - from somewhere* in New Hampshire. 
*She was asked several times by journalists at two events where she was watching the debate and did not answer. It's possible too that she couldn't hear the question amid the adoring throngs, but not likely, leaving us to wonder ... where in the Granite State is Hillary Clinton tweeting from?
Her first text of the night: "Hillary here. I'm here in New Hampshire watching the GOP debate - how about you?" 
Earlier in the evening, Clinton described the third Republican debate as "a little scary" and said she "feels sorry" for her GOP counterparts. During a speech at the party's Annual Grover Cleveland Dinner in Bartlett - where Cleveland's grandson George impersonating his presidential ancestor introduced Clinton - she joked: "For those of you masochistic enough to want to watch we'll try to get you out" of the event in time. 
Clinton carried on the joke, saying that the Republican debates are actually a lot like a "reality TV show, but the cast of characters are out of touch with actual reality". The room roared with laughter. 
She also said she felt bad for Republicans, who attacked her "when in doubt, when they have nothing else to say, when they don't want to take any responsible action". 
Meanwhile, residents in the early voting states of New Hampshire and Iowa are hearing Clinton's voice coming out of the television, too. The Clinton campaign began airing a series of issue-based television ads featuring working women. Though Clinton does not appear in the ads, she does the voice over. 
So far we've seen a commercial about Sarah, the senior business analysts, Alexis, the financial programming associate, Mindy, the cardiac nurse and Cheryl, the Kindergarten teacher. 
Oh, and her team is rapidly working to respond to attacks  over immigration, taxes, social security and Medicare, the economy, healthcare, LGBT equality, equal pay, affordable college, gun safety, criminal justice, raising the minimum wage and climate change. 
Wherever she is, she's keeping busy.

Closing statements. 
 Paul: I want small government. The budget deal this week is terrible. I'm going to filibuster it tomorrow. Enough's enough.
 Christie : Speaking to camera. Are you fed up with Washington? Are you concerned about the debt? Are you serious about it? Then elect someone who's "deadly serious about changing this culture." Chris Christie for clean government.
 Cruz : Who up here has actually taken on Washington? I have. My dad fled oppression. Freedom is personal for me.
 Fiorina : Every election we hear talk and intentions. "What we need now is a proven leader who has produced results. That's how you go from secretary to CEO." "I am Hillary Clinton's worst nightmare. In your heart of hearts you cannot wait to see a debate between [me] and HRC."
 Carson : I want to thank my colleagues and the audience "for being attentive and noticing the questions and noticing the answers." People are waking up. Political correctness stinks.
 Trump : Our country doesn't win anymore. We used to. We lose on trade, we lose with Isis. With Iran. We don't win. These folks, CNBC. $250,000 for a 30-second ad. Nobody wants to stand up here for 3.5 hours. They lost a lot of money. Everybody said it was going to be 3.5 hours. And after two minutes.

 Rubio : America is great. I love it. It's special. But it's slipping away. Leaders are out of touch. Let's expand the American dream. Vote Rubio.
 Bush : America's at a crossroads. I will change the culture in Washington. Just as I changed [cough] the culture in Tallahassee. We rule. Thank you.
 Huckabee : To the media this is a game and we're the players. But we give up our livelihoods and step out on this stage and fight for the people. "For those of us who are serious enough to run for president, think long and hard about why we're here... we're not here for ourselves."

Much more substance in the "grown-up" debate, writes Dominic Rushe.
There was almost a serious debate about visas and in particular the H-1B visas, given to skilled tech workers from abroad, that Silicon Valley is lobbying so hard to have increased. 
There is some compelling evidence that H-1B visas, loved by Mark Zuckerberg et al, are a scam. This study from the Economic Policy Institute found the top 10 users of H-1B's were all offshore outsourcing firms.
"There are two reasons these firms hire H-1Bs instead of Americans: 1) an H-1B worker can legally be paid less than a U.S. worker in the same occupation and locality; and 2) the H-1B worker learns the job and then rotates back to the home country and takes the work with him," according to the report. 
Zuckerberg-backed lobby FWD.US has been pushing for an increase, supported by Rubio. And Trump has been highly critical of the scheme - but not tonight. 
Trump has called for employers to pay H-1B workers much more money in an attempt to discourage companies and boost job prospects for Americans. He also wants tech jobs offered to unemployed Americans before workers with H-1B visas
"This will improve the number of black, Hispanic and female workers in Silicon Valley who have been passed over in favor of the H-1B program. Mark Zuckerberg's personal Senator, Marco Rubio, has a bill to triple H-1Bs that would decimate women and minorities," Trump wrote in his immigration plan in August. Tonight he had no problem with Zuck! Interesting. He's prepared to take on CNBC, even Fox, but not Facebook.

Jeb Bush finally threw down the gauntlet at his former protege Marco Rubio tonight, but his efforts to attack the Florida senator may have backfired, reports Sabrina Siddiqui, who has followed Rubio's campaign closely.
Bush interjected as Rubio tried to explain away his low attendance record in the Senate, on the same day one of the largest newspapers in their home state of Florida called on Rubio to resign his seat.
Rubio recalled how several presidential candidates before him had missed a large percentage of their votes - including Barack Obama and John Kerry - and yet the same paper, the Florida Sun Sentinel, endorsed them for president.
"I read the editorial with great amusement," Rubio said. "This is another example of the double standard that exists in this country, between the mainstream media and the conservatives."
The crowd erupted in applause -- only that's where Bush stepped in, speaking as a resident of Florida and thus one of the senator's constituents.
"I expected he would do constituent service, which means he shows up to work," said Bush, while seeking to disprove Rubio's theory of bias by pointing out the paper had endorsed his 2010 Senate bid.
"When you signed up for this, this is a six-year term. You should be showing up to work," Bush said. "Literally, the Senate, is it a French work week? You get three days to show up.
"Just resign and let somebody else take the job. There are a lot of people who are living paycheck to paycheck in Florida."
But Rubio was ready, having clearly prepared for the moment in the wake of increasingly aggressive barbs from Team Jeb leading up to the debate.
"Someone convinced you attacking me is going to help you," Rubio told his former ally, before pivoting to his optimistic campaign message. "Here's the bottom line: my campaign will continue to be about the future of America.
"I'm not going to attack anyone else on stage. I will continue to have tremendous admiration for Governor Bush. I'm not running against anyone on the stage. I'm running for president, because there is no way we can elect Hillary Clinton."
Bush and Rubio are competing for the mantle of the more mainstream, electable Republican candidate. The two are also courting similar donors, and Bush's inability to gain traction poses a risk that he may lose financial backers to Rubio.
Rubio has only slightly risen in the polls over the last month, but his aides have been optimistic that his well-received debate performances will help boost his profile - and persuade Bush donors to eye their younger, insurgent campaign.

From Guardian US opinion editor Megan Carpentier :
Texas Senator Ted Cruz learned the hard way that playing to the audience in the house might not play well with the debate moderators, when he used his time on a substantive question about his economic policies - particularly on the debt limit - to insult the CNBC reporters asking some hard-hitting questions of all the candidates.
Cruz - who eventually got 30 seconds to answer the question - decided to use his initial time to earn kudos from the audience for noting that "none" of the members of the media moderating the debate would be voting in the Republican primary and so, he alleged, they should be nicer to the candidates. 
(In fairness to Cruz, the debate - which started off with a pro-forma interview question about each candidate's weakness, turned heated quickly as moderators sought to contrast candidates' positions with economic realities and actual, you know, math.)
But while Cruz earned a round of applause from an audience that is, by now, completely accustomed to Republicans shrieking about the mainstream media's liberal bias, to viewers at home, asking Carson to explain how he'd plug the deficit by converting all taxes to tithes and then following up when he couldn't answer the question is supposed to be a debate moderator's job. They're not running for best promise-maker, they're running for president. And a little realism in the Republican race is better for Republicans than it'll be for Democrats.

First blood to John Kasich in what was a fairly substantial exchange on taxes, adds US business editor Dominic Rushe. 
Enough to make Donald Trump go for his throat, so it must have worked. Kasich has been very strong on the - cough - somewhat odd tax plans of the candidates, especially Trump and Ben Carson.
Carson's plan seems to be something to do with a 10% tithe, although tonight that has swollen to 15%. As moderator Betty Quick said such a scheme would require a 40% cut in government spending: "I've done the math."
Carson was very unconvincing. It's not enough, Kasich said, to say: "Why don't we just give chicken in every pot" or say we "are just going to be great."

From Guardian US columnist Jeb Lund :
John Kasich's appeal in this debate - "Folks, we gotta wake up!" - seems geared to both independents and to the Republican establishment. His direct message here might as well be, "Let's cut the BS": defending Medicare and social security; slamming Ben Carson's fantasy tithing tax; slamming Trump's vague calls for greatness. 
Kasich is taking the role of the pragmatic conservative that Jeb Bush can't avoid being, but he's doing it with an edge and energy that Bush constitutionally lacks and has been skittering away from as he tries to portray himself as a radical conservative during the primary. 
There's a virtue in polling toward the bottom, as Kasich is: it gives him the luxury of making being a conventional conservative sound like an edgy outlier position.

 First question: What's your biggest weakness? 
Kasich goes first. He ignores the question and says he fears the party will nominate someone not up for the job. He mentions Carson's proposal to end Medicare and Trump's to deport undocumented migrants. Not realistic, he says.
Huckabee says he doesn't have a weakness. But if he did it might be that he plays by the rules. Which Washington does not.
Bush says he is by nature impatient. But also: "I can't fake anger... I just don't believe that this country's days are going to be deeply, you know, going down."
Rubio: "I'm not sure it's a weakness, but... I believe there's a sense in this country that our best days lay behind us."
Trump: I'm too trusting. And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.

Before we move on to the main event, Ben Jacobs in Boulder has been talking to Bobby Jindal. The Louisiana governor won't commit to supporting the Republican nominee to succeed him in his state's gubernatorial runoff on 21 November.
In last week's first round of voting, Senator David Vitter, a Republican, finished second behind Democratic legislator John Bel Edwards in the state's "jungle primary." In Louisiana, all candidates compete in one primary and then the top two then advance to a general election. Vitter, despite being the favorite, just managed to barely edge out two other Republican candidates.
However, Jindal, who long been engaged in a feud with Vitter, refused to endorse the Republican standard bearer to succeed him. When asked by the Guardian if he would campaign on Vitter's behalf, Jindal said: "I respect the judgment of the voters in Louisiana. I think the press makes too much of watching voters try to endorse each other and look forward to seeing which candidate will commit to policies that will continue the economic development we've done in Louisiana." When pressed about whether he would even endorse Vitter, he said: "We haven't made that decision yet; that doesn't mean we won't but we haven't made that decision."
Politics in Louisiana are complicated by the fact Jindal has an approval rating of only 32% and is deeply disliked by many voters. Vitter has his own issues. He was embroiled in a prostitution scandal several years ago and a private investigator employed by his campaign was arrested last week for spying a county sheriff.

 The top-tier debate  
Welcome back for our coverage of the big show, the third Republican presidential debate. 
Donald Trump has been invited on national television to talk about money. Ben Carson takes the stage as a freshly minted frontrunner. Jeb Bush seems on the verge of fumbling the handoff of the White House from bro and pops. Marco Rubio was born to talk. 
Will Trump go after Carson for surpassing him in his beloved polls? Will Carson reveal a heretofore hidden depth on economic policy? Will Jeb Bush give America a reason to vote for him that does not have to do with his last name? (Some reason!, some say.) 
Ted Cruz raised $12m last quarter. Carly Fiorina's whole campaign strategy seems to be to kick ass in debates. John Kasich seems angry about something. Rand Paul and Chris Christie are just glad to be invited. And Mike Huckabee used to be the governor of Arkansas.

That was a really fun bit during the Kiddie Table debate, when Lindsey Graham joked about being a Fox News instead of CNBC watcher. It's just a little reminder that CNBC is the Marxist network that aired Rick Santelli's 1% whine about taxation and moochers that the conservative astroturf group FreedomWorks used to launch the Tea Party.

 Undercard debate - the verdict  
The undercard debate in Boulder featured a solid, if unexciting, exchange between the four second tier Republican candidates participating, reports Ben Jacobs  in Boulder.
South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal, former New York governor George Pataki and former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum spent an hour discussing economic issues with occasional moments of feistiness and a near constant stream of one-liners from Graham.
While there was a spirited exchange on tax policy between Jindal and Santorum over the relative importance of balancing the budget and simply cutting taxes in reducing the size of government and George Pataki echoed former Democratic candidate Jim Webb in complaining his lack of speaking time, the real star of the night was Graham.
The South Carolina Republican is well known for his sense of humor and seemed to cracked jokes nonstop during the debate. Graham mocked Senate colleague Bernie Sanders, saying "he went to the Soviet Union on his honeymoon and I don't think he ever came back" while also proclaiming: "I know beer."
The question is whether Graham will get any mileage out of the debate. After all, voters are electing a commander in chief and not a comedian in chief.

What have we learned from kiddie table economics so far, asks Guardian US business editor Dominic Rushe ? 
Not a lot. Socialism is bad, Obama is bad (and probably a socialist), taxes are bad. Not all Republicans believe climate change is a lie (but the ones who believe it's true probably won't get elected). And the arid Boulder weather has done wonders for Rick Santorum's hair.

As the undercard debate began, Jeb Bush rolled out an endorsement from a former vice president, notes Ben Jacobs  in Boulder.
The Bush campaign announced that George HW Bush's vice president, Dan Quayle was backing the former Florida governor.
The endorsement drew some skepticism. Quayle, who mounted an abortive bid for the White House in 2000 against George W Bush, was never regarded as one of the best and the brightest in American politics. Perhaps his best known moment was in 1992 when he insisted to a grade school student that the word "potato" should be spelled "potatoe".

Three years on from the horsemeat scandal: 3 lessons we have learned; 
Smaller businesses do not have the resources to map out dangers of food fraud in their supply chain, warns the expert who led the horsemeat inquiry.

Tom Levitt.

The horsemeat scandal of early 2013 sent shockwaves across the food industry. After weeks of bad headlines, the UK government finally responded by agreeing to an independent inquiry to look into how horsemeat got into ready meals and frozen beefburgers. 
 Related:  What's really on your plate: hidden world of food fraud revealed - in pictures
Heading up that investigation was Prof Chris Elliott, a long-time food safety specialist. His conclusions were scathing : with little investigation or prosecution of food crime there was a "huge incentive for the criminal to pursue food crime".
Three years on, I caught up with Elliott to find out if the supply chain is any safer today and what, if any, lessons have been learned. Here are his three key points:

Food crime is now a known risk to companies
Before horsemeat, criminal networks were involved across the food chain but were relatively under the radar. Today, food crime is high up the list of risks being monitored by companies. "There's now much more effort from people to understand their supply chains, where they're trying to get their materials from and what the risks from fraudulent activity might be," says Elliott. 
According to Elliot two drivers of food fraud are opportunity and market conditions, especially crop failure as it makes the replacement of expensive foods with cheaper ingredients more appealing to criminals. By way of example, he has highlighted how six common food products, including infant formula, guacamole and chorizo, could be at risk of food adulteration. 

Authorities across the EU are working closely on food fraud
The big problem when the horsemeat scandal broke was that no one was quite sure who was responsible for dealing with it, says Elliott. "It was a battle between different police forces and government departments and it took two to three months for the responsibility to get assigned, and if you give criminals two to three months to get away you're not going to catch too many of them."
Today, it is very clearly the responsibility of the Food Standards Agency and its newly formed Food Crime Unit. It works with police forces across of the country, with Europol, and with the Food Fraud Network, which links food safety authorities across Europe.

But consumers are not necessarily any safer
If you buy food from major supermarkets then they are probably mapping out their supply chains to work out where their risks of food fraud are, and monitoring them accordingly, says Elliott. The last thing Tesco, for example, wants is to have to issue another horsemeat-style apology. 
However, this is an enormous project, especially when you think that supermarkets might stock 35,000-40,000 different food products. Smaller food and retail businesses simply do not have the resources to map their supply chains to the same extent, so for them, warns Elliott, the risk has not necessarily been diminished. 
This might matter less in, say, the alcohol industry where sales are controlled by a small number of very large companies, but with food there is a much greater number of outlets. 
The ideal solution, says Elliott, would be for larger companies to support smaller ones to safeguard consumers. Trade groups, for example, should be used to collect and distribute information on fraud to others within the food industry.

ORLAN's best photograph: a striptease in the style of Botticelli; 
'The sheets were for my wedding trousseau, but I covered them in sperm and used them for a striptease instead'.

Interview by Kim Willsher.

The first one of these striptease photos is quite posed. I am a kind of Madonna. Then, as I undress, I am using my body to express the history of art - by emulating The Birth of Venus by Botticelli. Finally, you are left with a pile of sheets on the floor, like a chrysalis from which you don't know what will emerge.
This was done in 1975. The idea is that striptease for a woman is impossible because, even as she undresses, she is re-dressed by other images, thoughts, preconceived ideas and prejudices, none of which she can remove. Viewers don't see a nude woman - they see what's in their own head. 
The sheets were part of my trousseau, the gifts my mother prepared for my marriage. When I was a young girl, every time I wanted to go out, she would insist I help with these sheets. I asked all my lovers to put their sperm on them, then I used dye to bring out the pretty stains. Later, as part of a performance, I took a large needle and thread and embroidered the stains while blindfolded or looking straight at the audience.
I don't think my mother ever saw my works with these sheets. She knew I was into art and poetry, but she thought I'd stop all that nonsense when I was married. In fact, I didn't marry until much later and the sheets were never used for their original purpose. They were made of heavy scratchy linen that was extremely disagreeable against the skin. 
The photos were taken by one of my lovers. I don't remember exactly who, but I decided everything: the pose, the angle, the light. Unlike some of my other work, this wasn't very provocative or transgressive. If you take away the trousseau, it's basically me posing as the Venus of Botticelli.
These days, I'm interested in what kind of striptease might be possible in our era. For my latest exhibition, I had cells taken from my body in a biopsy and cultivated them, then played with how they looked. So it's a striptease with cells instead of clothes. I also took medical scans of my body and produced a 3D image of my skull. Lots of artists have worked with skulls, but I'm one of the first to work with my own - a skull that has an identity.
I almost chose another work of mine, The Origin of War, as my best shot. This was inspired by The Origin of the World, Gustave Courbet's famous painting of a woman's sex, with no head and no arms, just the top of her legs close up. My shot shows a modest-size penis that is half-erect. As an image, it is absolutely mutilating, like the work of a serial killer. It was shown at the MusÈe d'Orsay in Paris and they put it quite high up on the wall. I realised afterwards that they were not allowed to show erect or even semi-erect penises so they put it up high so that if anyone asked, they could say: "No, no, it's not an erection. It's just a question of perspective." Most newspapers and magazines have refused to publish the work, but it has been on television, which is a strange reversal.
I'm successful now, but it hasn't always been easy. In 1976, I performed The Kiss of the Artist at a contemporary art fair in Paris. I sat behind a slot machine that had been made to look like my nude torso. In return for a kiss, I invited people to put money in a slot between its breasts. The coins fell into a transparent box at the pubis. I was sacked from my job. The work was intended to question moral values, but the private school where I was teaching sent me a telegram saying: "Your attitude is incompatible with your role as a teacher. Your classes are cancelled."
I was left with no income and no money, with debts and a studio to run. It was a difficult time. The work caused a scandal.

WA Nationals cancel fundraiser on navy warship, blaming 'internal excitement'; 
State Nationals acknowledge use of commonwealth property was inappropriate, having sent out invitations to party fundraiser on HMAS Perth.

Daniel Hurst Political correspondent.

The Western Australian National party has cancelled a planned $1,000 a head political fundraiser aboard a navy warship after it admitted the idea was "not appropriate".
Paul Brown, a state Nationals MP, had sent out invitations promising "a unique luncheon experience with the Nationals WA leadership on-board the Australian navy warship, HMAS Perth ". 
The promotion carried the banner "All aboard!" and foreshadowed access to the National party's state leader, Terry Redman, the deputy leader, Mia Davies, and the state director, Jamie Forsyth.
Labor expressed outrage at the "utterly inappropriate" use of defence force assets and demanded an explanation of any approvals provided. The defence minister, Marise Payne, distanced herself from the scandal, saying her office and the Navy had no knowledge of the "regrettable" fundraising proposal.
Brown issued a statement on Thursday confirming the 15 January fundraiser had been cancelled. He blamed "internal excitement" within the WA Nationals.

"Shortly after the invitation was sent out [over the Christmas period], our own internal processes determined that holding a fundraiser on commonwealth property would not be appropriate, and we immediately cancelled the event," he said.
"Time constraints and our own internal excitement led to an oversight in judgment, which we corrected at our earliest opportunity."
Brown said the error occurred after he purchased a package - which included a tour of HMAS Perth, the use of a flight simulator and a group lunch - at a Royal Flying Doctor Service fundraising event.
He bought the package "in good faith" and intended "to put it to use in a positive way". He now acknowledges the political fundraiser was not an appropriate way to use the package, and his new plan was to invite disadvantaged families to join him on HMAS Perth.
Payne said her office had no knowledge of the event.
"I am advised that Navy was not informed that the event, which was originally auctioned to raise money for the Royal Flying Doctor Service, was being billed as a political fundraiser," the defence minister said on Thursday.
"Defence facilities should not be used for political fundraising purposes and it is regrettable that the original invitation was issued."
State and federal Labor MPs criticised the proposal.
The federal opposition's acting defence spokeswoman, Gai Brodtmann, asked who knew about the fundraiser, who authorised it and when it was approved.
"It is utterly inappropriate for such an event to be held on any ADF facility or asset and the defence minister must explain how this could be allowed to happen," she said.
The WA Labor spokesman on defence issues, Paul Papalia, said the episode was "an absolute disgrace" and called for an inquiry.
"A non-partisan apolitical defence force is a central pillar of the Australian democracy," he said. "Everyone knows that, the military know it, it appears though that the National Party of Western Australia just don't have a clue."

Marco Rubio's 'high-heeled booties' mocked by Republican rivals; 
Presidential candidate makes fashion splash on the campaign trail with three-inch heels and is roundly mocked for shoes 'straight out of Austin Powers'.

Scott Bixby.

Marco Rubio has made the critical political mistake of not dressing like a complete schlub. Everyone, it seems, is talking about his kinky boots. 
The Florida senator and Republican presidential candidate came close to pulling off an acceptably frumpy look as he boarded his campaign bus in New Hampshire on Monday: mildly unkempt hair; creased black dress pants before noon; a lumpy blue sweater. But Rubio's decision to don what Vanity Fair delicately dubbed " statement footwear " has turned his three-inch heels into a ball and chain. 
A chance tweet from a New York Times political reporter and former fashion correspondent spurred snark from Senator Ted Cruz's communications director ("A vote for Marco Rubio is a vote for men's high-heeled booties"), teasing from fellow Senator Rand Paul ("Cute new boots!"), and a sideswipe from fellow Floridian Jeb Bush ("They're not high-heeled").
"This is straight out of an Austin Powers movie," laughed MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, in an entire Morning Joe segment devoted to Rubio's sartorial slip-up. "They're shagalicious!"
All because Rubio broke the unwritten rule of American campaigning that requires would-be Oval Office occupants to replace the contents of their closets with heavily starched white dress shirts, three-inch wide red ties and boxy suit jackets at least two sizes too large. The only embellishment allowed, perhaps, is the candidate's choice of American flag pin. The dress code projects maturity, responsibility, and above all, hyper-masculinity, which means that for a presidential hopeful to don footwear in the same vein as that worn by teen Britpop idols is a fashion faux pas of the highest order.
But Rubio's shoes haven't garnered attention solely from men still uneasy about the mainstreaming of the word "metrosexual". Nearly eight years after then-vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin faced scorn and scandal for her $150,000 wardrobe makeover - the tab for which was picked up by the Republican National Committee - Republican candidates have stuck to fashion tastes as conservative as their politics as a method of separating themselves from the urban elite. Fancy shoes, snug suits, and $1,250 haircuts are the mark of effete liberals who never sit down to supper in their undershirt, no matter how hot the weather gets.
The result has been a generation of candidates in unsuitable suits. Current speaker of the House Paul Ryan may have shared a ticket with Mitt Romney, but he certainly didn't share a tailor ; Cruz's overcoat makes him look like three children stacked on top of each others' shoulders; Bush apparently sported the same grey half-zip jumper for four straight days in December.
One candidate, at least, didn't think that Rubio's heels were too tall. Carly Fiorina, a former chief executive and the only woman running in the Republican presidential primary, scoffed at the senator's pitiful mid-rises: "Yeah, Marco, but can you rock these?" she told Independent Journal, with an accompanying picture of her 3.5-inch heels.

Bill Clinton avoids taking Donald Trump's bait as he campaigns for Hillary; 
On the campaign trail the former president declined to discuss Trump, who released a video criticizing Hillary Clinton as a defender of women's rights.

David Smith in Washington.

While political rivals, pundits and journalists remain obsessed with Donald Trump, granting him publicity that money can't buy, one man spent the week studiously avoiding any mention of him.
Bill Clinton did not use the "T" word during his stump speeches in Iowa and New Hampshire as he entered the campaign fray on behalf of his wife, Hillary. This was despite Trump goading him with characteristically blunt references to past sexual indiscretions.
So far at least, the former president has not taken the bait, seeking instead to rise above the trading of insults that can fuel the news cycle.  
There were just shy of 800 attendees at both of Clinton's events in New Hampshire this week, roughly the same as the crowd size Hillary drew while campaigning in the state a day earlier. Those expecting a verbal prize fight with Trump were disappointed. 
But when Clinton moved on to Iowa, shaking hands, posing for selfies and sampling a green fruit and vegetable smoothie, a TV journalist blocked his path and attempted to force the issue. Asked if he could be a liability to Hillary's campaign as Trump revives old scandals, he replied: "I don't have a response. If he wins the Republican nomination, we'll have plenty of time to talk about it if Hillary wins."
He added: "I don't want to be involved in their politics or do anything except trying to help Hillary." 
Trump has declared Clinton's past troubles fair game. On Thursday he released a video that juxtaposed arguably Hillary's finest hour as first lady - a 1995 speech in Beijing where she declared "human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights" - with photos of Clinton with Monica Lewinsky (the White House intern with whom he had an extramarital affair), a newspaper front page branding Clinton "Liar, liar", and the sex scandal-plagued Anthony Weiner - husband of her trusted aide Huma Abedin. Finally, the video ended on an image of Hillary Clinton with Bill Cosby, and a caption reading: "True defender of women's rights."
                     Hillary tweeted later that day: "It's important to stand up to bullies wherever they are."
Sexual allegations against Bill Clinton from the late 1970s were revived in the media from a self-declared Trump supporter. Last month, Hillary was challenged at a town hall meeting in New Hampshire by a woman who asked her directly about three women who have made historic allegations about her husband.
Trump's efforts to challenge Hillary Clinton's record on women's rights comes as she enters this weekend seeking to harness the support of young women, by enlisting Lena Dunham, creator of the series Girls , on the campaign trail in Iowa. Polls have shown that Clinton's rival, the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, has consistently polled higher with young voters.
Trump is not alone in seeking to conflate Hillary with her husband's record as president. After it emerged that North Korea had conducted a nuclear test  this week, Republican candidate Ted Cruz told reporters: "It's worth remembering North Korea has a nuclear weapon today because of the Clinton administration. The Clinton administration led the world in relaxing sanctions against North Korea. They used the billions of dollars that flowed into North Korea to develop nuclear weapons. Now we're facing a megalomaniacal maniac who may potentially have a hydrogen bomb."
Hammering the Clintons plays well with the Republican base, although there is little evidence over time that highlighting the former president's infidelity hurts Hillary at the polls. Bill Clinton is expected to be a more visible presence in the lead-up to the 1 February caucuses in Iowa and 9 February New Hampshire primary. Next week the couple's daughter, Chelsea, will be deployed in New Hampshire.
For his part, Clinton may be anxious to avoid the experience of 2008 when his attacks on Barack Obama, including his description of Obama's stance on the Iraq war as a "fairytale", appeared to backfire. "I don't fit any more," he said in Nashua, New Hampshire, this week. "First of all, I'm a happy grandfather. I'm not mad at anybody."
                     Shaun Bowler, professor of political science at the University of California Riverside, suggested that the former president's refusal to fight Trump on his own turf is probably wise. "In terms of Trump, my sense is that at this stage in the campaign he is defining himself and not being defined by others," he said. "To date the attempts by others to paint him - as a loose cannon for example - do not seem to have made much of an impression on him or his supporters.
"In that context, at the present time, it doesn't seem as if there is much that Bill Clinton can say or do to change that. Also, I'm not sure it is Bill Clinton's role to engage with Trump. At this point it seems more about introducing him to the electorate via the campaign so that - post-convention - people are familiar with him. Whatever his accomplishments and achievements in the past, Bill Clinton's current job is to stand by his spouse."

Anthony Hopkins: 'Every day I think about quitting'; 
The actor discussed the nature of the industry alongside his co-star in The Dresser, Ian McKellen, during the project's panel in California.

Nigel M Smith in Los Angeles.

It's hard to believe, but it's taken over half a century into the careers of Sir Ian McKellen and Sir Anthony Hopkins for the revered duo to collaborate. The pair co-lead the new Starz and BBC movie The Dresser, which aired in the UK late last year, and premieres in the US this summer. The actors were joined by director Richard Eyre (Notes on a Scandal) and executive producer Colin Callender at the film's Television Critics Association (TCA) winter press tour panel in Pasadena, California, on Friday.
 Related:  Ian McKellen: 'I'm like a carpenter who can be relied on to make a good chair' 
Like the acclaimed play of the same name by Ronald Harwood on which it is based, The Dresser takes place over the course of one night in a small English regional theater during the second world war as a frantic troupe of actors try to keep their production of Shakespeare's King Lear afloat, despite the worries of its lead star, played by Hopkins. McKellen plays his doting dresser.
Hopkins said he was drawn to the material because of how it explores "that peculiar nature of why actors want to act. This play more or less answers that," he said. "That you have to go half mad to survive that kind of life. The man I play is one who is obsessed with the art and obsessed with Lear."
McKellen said The Dresser is the only film that succeeds at truly capturing what it means to be a performer. "I think every actor recognized their past in this play," McKellen said.
Hopkins confessed to having an "odd relationship with Shakespeare in the theater", before embarking on The Dresser. Hopkins recalled having an "uneasy" time working as a theater actor in the UK, before making a move to the US early in his career to pursue film. He described making The Dresser as "a painless revisit to a world I knew 50 years ago. Now I can understand why so many great actors like Shakespeare."
Hopkins added: "I now get it. Although I did Lear a long time ago, I wasn't very happy with that. Now I really understand because I'm as old as Lear. They say all old men should play Lear." The actor added that revisiting Lear for The Dresser gave him "the courage of a lifetime". "I'd been hoping I hadn't lost it."

Asked if he'd ever wanted to quit acting altogether, Hopkins said he has in fact tried to several times. "Every day I think about quitting, but they come and offer me a job, and I say OK, because I'm an actor," he elaborated. "We are mad. All actors want to be loved - I think that's in all actors. We want more, more, more ..."
"I never wanted to quit," retorted McKellen. "What would I do? It's one of the thrilling things about acting - you don't necessarily have to stop. There will always be the part for some old geezer in the corner of the script. You've got me for as long as I'm mobile."

The Dresser debuts on Starz in the US this summer.

Clinton adviser urged using hurricane to boost Obama's re-election bid; 
Sidney Blumenthal emails among new tranche release by state departmentFormer White House official also offered his views on Benghazi attack.

David Smith in Washington.

One of Hillary Clinton's closest advisers told her that Barack Obama should use a deadly hurricane to boost his re-election campaign, a proposal that she agreed to pass on to the White House, a new tranche of emails reveals.
 Related:  Blair and Clinton transcripts reveal global concerns of two buddies
Sidney Blumenthal, a longtime friend of the Clintons, sent a memo in 2012 presenting a strategy for turning Hurricane Isaac to the Democrats' political advantage by contrasting it with President George W Bush's handling of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.
The missive emerged among 2,900 pages from the former secretary of state's email account released by the state department just after 1.30am on Friday. 
Critics are likely to seize on the email to once more accuse the Democratic frontrunner's camp of cold political scheming. Hurricane Isaac reportedly killed 24 people in Haiti, five in the Dominican Republic and five in the US, displaced thousands and caused billions of dollars of damage.
In a message with the jocular subject heading, "H: FYI. In case you or Bill have use for this. Done quickly am in spirit of John Lennon. ('I read the news today, oh, boy'). Sid", Blumenthal wrote to Clinton on 27 August 2012: "The moment George W Bush's popularity collapsed was in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. His decline was not the result of the Iraq War; instead, it was sudden, rapid and unrecoverable post-Katrina. Then and only then did his standing on every other issue disintegrate."
With Hurricane Isaac set to hit the Gulf coast and possibly veer towards New Orleans, Blumenthal urged the administration to set up a command post and send Vice-President Joe Biden and the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) to the scene.
"The theme of the Republican convention is the failure of President Obama, not only on the economy but also generally as an effective chief executive," he continued. "The FEMA effort after Isaac will: a. Implicitly contrast with the Bush one after Katrina; b. Demonstrate that the Obama administration is effective and acts in the public interest by effectively managing government; c. Show the indispensability of the federal government without ever having to make an ideological case. And: Once the FEMA effort begins, while the Republican convention is meeting, Democrats across the board should point out that the Romney-Ryan budget plans would slash FEMA. Even if not specified, as little is specified in their plans, drastic FEMA cuts would be inevitable."
 Related:  Hillary Clinton: the best of her emails
Clinton replied: "I passed this on to the White House. We'll see what happens."
Blumenthal wrote back: "All Obama needs to do is turn up, surrounded by commanders, on the Gulf Coast, post-hurricane, on Saturday. The hurricane is the counter-convention. It provides the counter message without ever having to debate it: Obama is effective, gets things done, government is essential, etc. The event is the message. Plus, on the anniversary of Katrina, the contrast is naturally made, and Bush pops up."
An author, journalist and former White House official, Blumenthal has been a regular protagonist in the Clinton email releases. The secretary of state's responses make clear that she took his advice on foreign policy seriously. There is also warmth in an email she wrote after calling on Blumenthal and his wife in 2010: "Thx so much for a wonderful visit. Just reminds me how much I miss seeing you and Jackie."
In 2013, after falling ill, she wrote to him: "I've been too busy drinking water to reply, but want to thank you and Jackie for your good wishes during these past weeks. I'm happy to report that I'm on the mend and plan to be back at work next week for the final lap. Hope you're off to a happy and HEALTHY new year. Looking forward to catching up, H."
Clinton's use of a private email account has been under particular scrutiny in relation to the September 2012 attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that left ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans dead. Opponents have seized on the vague and conflicting accounts that officials gave in the days immediately after the incident.
On 13 September 2012, two days after the attack, Blumenthal emailed Clinton with a memo drawing on "sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the highest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services".
Libyan security officials "do believe that the attackers having prepared to launch their assault took advantage of the cover provided by the demonstrations in Benghazi protesting an internet production seen as disrespectful to the prophet Mohammed," he wrote. "According to this source, the immediate events were set in motion by a statement made by a Muslim Cleric in Egypt saying that the internet film was going to be shown across the United States on September 11 in an effort to insult Muslims on the anniversary of the attacks on the New York World Trade Center in 2001."
Libyan security officers also said the "attacks had been planned for approximately one month, based on casing information obtained during an early demonstration at the US consulate in Benghazi. The attackers were, in the opinion of these individuals, looking for an opportunity to approach the consulate under cover in a crowd ... They describe these forces as well-trained, hardened killers; many of whom have spent time in Afghanistan and Yemen."
A few months later, Blumenthal wrote to the secretary of state about the Republican backlash: "Here's the ultimate Benghazi conspiracy theory that wingers believe: [CIA director] John Brennan, without a presidential finding, at the behest of the Saudis, created a covert CIA operation at the Benghazi consulate to run arms secretly to the Syrian rebels. And the administration covered it up to protect Obama in the election. In other words, a projection of Iran-contra and Watergate rolled into one."
He also gossiped about retired general David Petraeus's affair with biographer Paula Broadwell, which forced Petraeus's resignation shortly after Obama's re-election. In November 2010 Blumenthal wrote: "From Jane Mayer, just now, 7:20 pm. Her husband, Bill Hamilton is national security editor of NYT [New York Times], in charge of Petraeus story: 'Omigod - there's a new twist. You wont believe who tipped off the FBI - you are so right that it has the stench of dirty tricks. I think it may just be a Times story so I have to keep my mouth shut for a few more hours, but you're going to like this.'"
In another message to Clinton he commented: "My operative theory on Petraeus scandal is that it became an October Surprise that failed. Forcing the scandal public and his resignation would have been the trifecta - leaks, Benghazi, then Petraeus - allowing Romney to argue that Obama had created a national security collapse. It would have overtaken the end of the campaign."
On Thursday a watchdog found the state department produced "inaccurate and incomplete" responses to public records requests while Clinton was in office, including its inability to find documents showing she used a private email account for official business. The inspector general's report said personnel responsible for Freedom of Information Act requests in the secretary's office often missed deadlines and did not meet legal requirements for conducting complete searches.
The release of the latest batch of emails, originally scheduled for Thursday evening, was postponed until 11.45pm, and the emails finally emerged at 1.39am.

When police can spy on innocent people like me, we're in the age of thought crime; 
A principled whistleblower alleges the Met improperly deleted files on me. Yet why was I marked as a 'domestic extremist' in the first place?.

Jenny Jones.

After 15 years' experience of holding the Metropolitan police to account, I'm not easily shocked by the whiff of scandal, but the apparently unofficial deletion of my "domestic extremism" files is one of those truly eye-opening moments.
Before I get into the wider issues about invasion of privacy and cover-up, I want to pay tribute to the police officer, Sgt David Williams, who has tried to point out apparent wrongdoing within the intelligence unit where he works and who could now face dire personal consequences as a result. He has done it in the proper way, using the established channels. He has been fobbed off, but has persisted. He has pushed the whistleblower system to its limit, failed to get a proper response from within the Met and decided that his conscience requires him to speak to the person most affected by this alleged wrongdoing - me. He deserves our support. 
 Related:  Officer claims Met police improperly destroyed files on Green party peer
There are a lot of big questions arising from the deletion of my files. The biggest is, why did the Met have this information on me in the first place? While I was being monitored, I spent eight years on the Metropolitan Police Authority holding the Met to account and signing off their annual budget. My opinions have always been upfront, clear and occasionally even pro-police. So why were I and thousands of other perfectly innocent people labelled as domestic extremists? Why did the list include the comedian Mark Thomas and five journalists working on stories which exposed wrongdoing by big corporations? Who authorises such a waste of police time and money?
I now have lots of other questions which I expect the Met commissioner to answer. If my files were deleted legitimately after I challenged them, how did they later find a "deleted" copy to check that I had previously received all the information requested? When the Met sent me my file in August 2013 it had 17 items on it, but Williams claims that Met officers deleted about 30 items later in June 2014. Does this mean that the Met can resurrect all deleted files on innocent people, despite it being decided that they should not legitimately be holding such information? Had they collected that many new files in the intervening period?
I kicked up a fuss in 2013, demanding that the Met adopt a stricter definition of domestic extremism, only applying it to those involved in terrorism or serious crime. I was told that thousands of files were then deleted from the database in accordance with the new definition. I have no problem with my file being part of a general clear-out as the Met claims, but Williams alleges this was fast-tracked five days after I met managers of the domestic extremism unit in 2014 and told them I would send an updated request for my file.
The oddest thing about this very strange affair is that I recently put in another request and discovered that I was back on the database, with one entry dated 2013 about a protest outside the Daily Mail. So I'm once again a "domestic extremist" in the Met's eyes, but under the stricter criteria of being involved in terrorism and/or serious crime. I'm surprised the Met police commissioner lets me anywhere near him at the regular meetings of the City Hall police and crime committee, of which I'm vice-chair.
It seems we have entered the age of "thought crime", when the police make judgments on whose views are extreme or radical. Databases and undercover officers are the tools of a police service which has been given the green light by successive governments to spy on their citizens. This is not right, and principled people like Williams did not become police officers to spy on politicians, campaigners and other innocent people.

Asking Silicon Valley to 'disrupt' terrorists is tech talk for 'surveillance'; 
You can hate Isis while still being disturbed about the lengths the government is going to pressure these tech companies.

Trevor Timm.

The White House and its national security team are set to meet Friday with the country's largest tech companies, like Facebook and Google, to discuss how they can help "disrupt" Isis's online activities (that cringe-worthy phrase is theirs, not mine). On the agenda : censorship and invasive anti-privacy and security measures that could affect not just Isis supporters, but everyone who uses the internet. 
You can hate Isis while still being disturbed about the lengths the government is going to pressure these tech companies. There are so many shady things going on with this meeting it's hard to know where to start. 
 Related:  Revealed: White House seeks to enlist Silicon Valley to 'disrupt radicalization'
First, tech companies were reportedly lured into the meeting with the promise that it was going to be about how to prevent Isis from using social media to amplify its message (we'll get to that later on), but then, as the Guardian's Danny Yadron reported, US officials pulled a "bait and switch" on the tech companies and cornered them into discussing encryption as well. FBI director Jim Comey's "participation in the meeting was on the condition of encryption being on the agenda," according to the Washington Post.
Despite the huge security benefits to encryption and the fact that it has not played a significant role in any of the recent terrorist attacks, the FBI has been on a warpath to get tech companies to stop using end-to-end encryption in some of their communications tools, essentially asking tech giants to give the government a "back door" to make sure there is not any communication platform that they cannot spy on.
This is a dangerously short-sighted move that will not only weaken internet security for everyone and put everyone's privacy at further risk, but will also give Russia, China and other authoritarian countries the green light to demand the exact same thing to crush dissent.
While it's not widely discussed, there are actually plenty of government officials who are smart enough to realize this and are strong advocates for encryption - like representatives at the Commerce Department, the FTC and most importantly, the White House's science and technology office. Yet none of these agencies - who have many qualifiedtechnologists who can clearly explain the pitfalls to creating encryption back doors - were invited to the meeting. Instead it's the national security team - whose members have, time and time again, demonstrated ignorance when it comes to how technology works - who will be setting the agenda.
Then there's the question of tech companies cooperating more with the government on blocking and censoring Isis's propaganda arm (since the US seems to be so inept at combating it themselves). Isis's ability to recruit may be concerning, but does it make anyone else uncomfortable that the White House and FBI are pushing so hard behind closed doors for private companies to censor so much content? There's a reason Congress has not passed a law banning Isis propaganda or the Justice Department does not get a court order to censor it: because criticizing the US government - even when wrapped in disgusting and vague calls for violence - is, in many cases, protected by the first amendment. What happens when they start using these unofficial channels to start asking for censorship of other content that they couldn't censor through legal means?
But this may be besides the point: what more are tech companies supposed to do? Promoting terrorism is already a violation their terms of service, and news report after news report has shown that they are constantly spending incredible manpower taking down, in some cases, thousands of Isis-related accounts per day.
Their trigger finger is already so quick it has led to some pretty high-profile and horrible mistakes. Just last week, Twitter temporarily banned Iyad El-Baghdadi, a prominent anti-Isis critic, and refused to apologize for it because a newspaper confused his (common) Islamic name with that of the Isis leader.
This all begs the question of what, exactly, government officials hope Silicon Valley actually does, since they already work to ban terrorism-related content and are unlikely to budge on backdoors. Build tools that will allow the government to surveil the tens of billions of web posts that are published daily? The government does have much more legal latitude to surveil public posts rather than private ones, but that doesn't mean we should be creating tools to make that easier for them when those tools can quickly be turned into surveillance devices of all sorts that could go after much more than just terrorism.
Do they want automated censoring of posts? That is a recipe for disaster and will likely ensnare untold millions of posts that are not only protected by the First Amendment, but don't violate any of these tech companies' increasingly strict rules for what constitutes acceptable posting. Countless people post about Isis per day in various forms of commentary, the vast majority of which is condemnation. The amount of false positives that will flag and censor law-abiding users will be staggering.
Tech companies themselves have a first amendment right to devise policies that will allow them to block anyone they wish. But if the government wants them to go above and beyond through censorship and surveillance, they should be using the legal process, not backroom deals. For years, civil society groups have pressured tech companies to require legal orders before handing over users' data since there were so many scandals involving voluntary and legally dubious surveillance during the Bush years. Do we really want to go back to those times, when it was just a wink and a nod between giant corporation and law enforcement?
By the way, many intelligence officials often find Isis-related social media posts to be a good - and in some cases, the only - real time window into what Isis is actually doing. So be careful what you wish for.

In 2016, let's have fewer smug conspiracy theories; 
From 9/11 to the Bosnian war, there are always people lurking with some alternative notion to try to demonstrate their superiority - now it's Cologne's turn.

Peter Bradshaw.

Until relatively recently, I was fascinated by conspiracy theories, and impatient with worldly saloon-bar types congratulating themselves on subscribing to the "cockup theory" - as if conspiracies didn't get cocked up all the time. And I am still uneasy about Whitewater and Vince Foster, that forgotten scandal of the Bill Clinton era. But nowadays there is always a malign pseudo-sophisticate dunce who can be relied upon to appear out of the online thicket, darkly insisting on a "provocateur" conspiracy behind everything.

There are people who proclaim that Jewish people were behind 9/11, as a way of provoking the "war on terror". During the Bosnian war, there were Serbs who claimed Muslims were bombing their own positions to bring Nato into the conflict on their side. And right now, online, there are people promoting the theory that obnoxious Pegida, the German anti-immigration group, were masterminding the mass harassment and sexual assaults on women in Cologne and elsewhere, in order to create a backlash against migrants. It's a thought-paralysing piece of smugness that has one purpose: to demonstrate the speaker's I-know-what's-really-going-on superiority. I'm hoping for less conspiracy in 2016.

After the revelation of his 1985 private memo about the urban riots, in which he told Margaret Thatcher that funding a communities programme would merely help people "set up in the disco and drug trade", a pseudo-penitent Letwin wrote that some parts of his memo "were both badly worded and wrong. I apologise unreservedly for any offence these comments have caused." Later, he modified the outrageous weasel word "any" and made it "the offence".
What fascinates me is that brazen "unreservedly", used to camouflage his feline reservations. Perhaps Letwin was inspired by Ken Livingstone who, after objections to his wisecrack about a shadow minister needing psychiatric help, tweeted, " I unreservedly apologise to Kevan Jones ", before implying this was at least partly a matter of loyalty to Jeremy Corbyn. Could it be that "unreservedly" will be the hot new non-soz catchphrase of 2016? As in: "I unreservedly apologise for some parts of something I have said."

The name of the game
As we complete our first week back at work, it's hard to recall any of the lassitude of the Yuletide break. But there is one supremely ridiculous parlour game that I think will catch on. It is called Celebrities, and it is just silly enough to be addictive.

You go around the table clockwise saying celebrities' names, the first name of which has to have the first letter of the previous surname, as in: "William Shakespeare!" "Stephen King!" "Keith Richards!" "Ronnie Kray!" If someone pauses, they're out. But you can reverse the direction by coming up with a celebrity whose surname and first name have the same letter. So, by following Ronnie Kray with Kevin Keegan, the "Ronnie Kray" person must instantly think of someone else.
The double letter is a dramatic moment. I got overexcited and when someone gave me "James Baldwin" I screamed, "Benjamin Bratt! In your face! " - causing a stunned, embarrassed silence among the other players. It's important not to get carried away.

Game of Thrones to return in April as HBO unveils new shows; 
The sixth season of Game of Thrones is back on 24 April - and Martin Scorsese and Mick Jagger discuss their new show Vinyl.

Nigel M Smith in Los Angeles.

HBO stuck to showcasing new shows during the premium cable network's star-studded panel at the Television Critics Association presentation in Pasadena, California, on Thursday. After quickly announcing that 24 April will see the return of Game of Thrones, Silicon Valley and Veep, the panel placed the focus on new programs airing on the channel in the coming months, including two feature films, one documentary, and one highly touted new series from executive producer Martin Scorsese. Here's what they discussed. 

Nothing Left Unsaid: Gloria Vanderbilt and Anderson Cooper
The premium network's first major documentary release of the year, which premieres at the Sundance film festival before airing in April, is an intimate profile of heiress-designer-artist-writer-socialite Gloria Vanderbilt, who at 91, appears to have lost none of her vitality and sass. She's accompanied by her CNN anchorman son, Anderson Cooper, in the film as the two look back on her life through a series of candid conversations. Vanderbilt was joined by the film's Oscar-nominated director Liz Garbus ( What Happened, Miss Simone? ) onstage, with Cooper video-conferenced in from George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, where he was about to interview President Obama live for CNN about the president's recent executive actions on gun control. 
Vanderbilt and Cooper spoke at length about how the process of making the film brought them closer. "I know my mom in a way I didn't know her before we started this process," Cooper said. "I realize how much like my mom I am, which I never would have believed."
Vanderbilt said the experience of being documented was "very freeing". "If one is telling the truth, there is nothing to fear," she added.
To coincide with the release of the film, the pair have penned the joint memoir, The Rainbow Comes and Goes: A Mother and Son Talk About Life, Love and Loss, which will be available for purchase in April. Cooper called the upcoming book an "extension of the documentary".

Nothing Left Unsaid: Gloria Vanderbilt and Anderson Cooper debuts 9 April on HBO.

All the Way
This film adaptation of the award-winning play of the same name about President Lyndon B Johnson's tumultuous first year in office finds Bryan Cranston reprising his role as Johnson, which won him a Tony for best actor in 2014. The project reunites Cranston with his Trumbo director Jay Roach, who last worked with HBO on the Emmy-award-winning film Game Change.
Cranston said he had no qualms in revisiting the role for HBO, because he was so energized at the chance to "reach millions more". "It's an important story to tell," he said. "That's how this all started."

Writer Robert Schenkkan, who also penned the play, stressed that the screen adaptation is inherently more cinematic, and that in order to make it work as a film he cut scenes, and added new sequences to "go deeper than we were able to get onstage".
Cranston was also able to immerse himself further in the project by donning prosthetics to resemble Johnson more closely than onstage. For the film, Cranston said he and the crew went for total visual accuracy, which in turn, said the actor, boosted his confidence on set.
"I'd ad-lib and joke around as the character," said Cranston. "It helped me stay in character through the logistics of making a movie."
Johnson's first year in office found him balancing opposing interests to launch his landmark Civil Rights Bill, with the support of Martin Luther King Jr in 1964. Anthony Mackie, who plays King in the film, revealed that he's been asked to play the activist before, but that Schenkkan's script was the first to portray the "Martin Luther King Jr that I knew." Added Mackie: "This was the first time I saw Martin Luther King Jr as not being a pushover. That man was not a pushover."

All the Way debuts in May on HBO.

Confirmation
Kerry Washington leads the cast of the second HBO film showcased at the network's panel. Confirmation, from Dope director Rick Famuyiwa, features the Scandal Emmy nominee as Anita Hill, the former aide to Clarence Thomas (played by Wendell Pierce in the film), who caused his nomination to the supreme court to be called into question when she testified that the judge had sexually harassed her. 
Washington, who also served as executive producer on the project, recalled being 14 years old when the case made national headlines. "My mother was an academic and had very passionate feelings," she said. "So did my father, as a black man. It always stuck with me how passionate they were [about the case], and how differently they looked at the situation.
"It was such an important moment in our country," added Washington. "These events really transformed the way we consume our news."
Washington said that she met with Hill, who now works as a professor of social policy, law and women's studies at Brandeis University, prior to embarking on the project. "I felt that was something we shared," Washington said. "The circumstances of life thrusting you in the public eye without it really being your choice."
Washington admitted at being "terrified of playing her". "Portraying somebody who is real is a different kind of responsibility especially when they're alive," she explained. "That significance was not lost on me."

Confirmation debuts in April on HBO.

Vinyl
HBO played it wise to leave the most anticipated panel for last for their hugely anticipated new show Vinyl, which reunites the network with Martin Scorsese, who previously executive-produced Boardwalk Empire which ended its run on HBO in 2014. He's back assuming the same role on Vinyl, a drama about a New York music executive played by Bobby Cannavale in the late 1970s who does all it takes to make a name for himself in the cutthroat business. Vinyl finds the director working alongside Mick Jagger, a producer on the project.
Cannavale was joined by his onscreen wife on the show, Olivia Wilde, at the panel, but it was Scorsese and Jagger who commanded the most attention despite being video-conferenced in via satellite.

Jagger, looking thrilled to be talking about Vinyl, revealed that he and Scorsese had initially tried to develop the material as a feature film. The pair previously collaborated on the Rolling Stones concert documentary Shine a Light in 2008. "We wrote scripts, and it was a very sprawling idea," said Jagger. "When TV series came online and started to become interesting, respectable and moneymaking, we started to make a TV series of it."
Scorsese, who directed the pilot, said he hopes to find time to direct more episodes in the future, but that he remains involved in all stages of production, including selecting the directors for each episode, and aiding in the selection of the music along with Jagger. 
The Rolling Stone frontman credited Scorsese for changing the way directors use music in TV and film. "He more or less invented the use of music the way we're now used to, and at home with," said Jagger. Of their enduring rapport, the singer said, "I don't think we find it very difficult to communicate, even though it appears we come from different worlds. I suppose we do, so we meet somewhere in the middle."
For his part, Scorsese said that music is "very much a part of my life", while adding that Jagger's music initially served as "the inspiration for a lot of the visualisations" in his early work. 

Vinyl premieres on HBO 14 February

London takes just one week to breach annual air pollution limits; 
Parts of the capital have already breached EU hourly limits for nitrogen dioxide pollution which causes thousands of premature deaths each year.

Adam Vaughan.

London has already breached annual pollution limits just one week into 2016, and only weeks after the government published its plans to clean up the UK's air. 
At 7am on Friday, Putney High Street in West London breached annual limits for nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a toxic gas produced by diesel vehicles that has been linked to respiratory and heart problems. 
Under EU rules, sites are only allowed to breach hourly limits of 200 micrograms of NO2 per cubic meter of air 18 times in a year, but this morning Putney broke that limit for the 19th time. Chelsea and Kensington is expected to do the same later today.  
Oxford Street has almost certainly also broken the limit already, having breached the hourly level a thousand times last year, but the monitoring station has malfunctioned. 
Campaigners said it was "breathtaking" the breach had come so early, though Oxford Street breached the annual limit in two days in 2015.
Nationally, a roadside near the South Wales town of Swffryd appears to be the only other place to have broken the hourly limit, though it is still far from having breached the annual limit. Other sites recording high readings so far this year include ones in Aberdeen, Belfast, Exeter, Glasgow and Stoke-on-Trent, and several other roads in London.
The UK has been in breach of EU NO2 pollution limits for five years now and last spring was ordered by the supreme court to publish an action plan on how to tackle the major health crisis, following a challenge by environmental law group ClientEarth.
                     The resulting government plan was published in December, but London, Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool, Cardiff and Edinburgh and other major cities will still be in breach of NO2 limits for at least another five years, despite the new measures. Private passenger cars are exempt from the plan. 
Attention on the harm caused to human health by NO2 came to the fore last year when it was revealed that VW had cheated NO2 emissions tests in the US, with the scandal affecting 1.2m diesel cars in the UK. Next week, VW UK bosses will be quizzed by MPs on the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs committee on diesel pollution and what they are doing to make cleaner cars.
Andrew Grieve, an air quality analyst at King's College London, which measures London's air pollution levels, said the early breach in the capital was not extraordinary looking at data from previous years.
"It's just [that] central London, and London as a whole, have a really huge problem with NO2. Breaching so early in the year really just illustrates how big a problem it is," he told the Guardian. He added that there were lots of similar roads to those that breached limits earlier but did not have monitors on them.
Campaigners and politicians blamed the government for the breach.
Alan Andrews, a lawyer for ClientEarth, said: "This is exactly why we are taking the government back to court [over the plan it published in December]. Its failure to deal with illegal levels of air pollution, which causes thousands of early deaths in London every year, is a scandal."
Simon Birkett, founder and director of Clean Air in London, said: "It is breathtaking that toxic air pollution in London has breached the legal limit for a whole year within a few days."
Labour MEP, Seb Dance, said the government should 'put up or shut up': "Receiving this dubious accolade has become a depressing annual event for London. NOx [which includes NO2] kills thousands of Londoners every year, but the government shows no inclination to take proper action.
"Tory ministers say the right things, but in reality they have lobbied hard against ambitious new EU air quality targets and have let car manufacturers off the hook after the VW scandal. It's time for the UK government to put up or shut up."
Jenny Jones, a London Assembly Green Party member, said the breach demonstrated failures by the mayor of London and national government. 
A spokeswoman for the environment department said: "Tackling air pollution is a priority for this Government and that is why last month we published plans setting out how we will improve the UK's air quality through a new programme of Clean Air Zones and continued investment in clean technologies."
A spokesman for the mayor of London's office said: "The mayor is leading the most ambitious and comprehensive package of measures in the world to improve London's air quality. His recent £10m bus retrofit programme has led to a sustained reduction in NO2 concentrations on Putney High Street."
A report commissioned by mayor Boris Johnson last year found that nearly 9,500 people die prematurely each year because of the capital's dirty air. A ultra low emissions zone is due to begin in 2020 in London to help tackle the problem.
Across the UK, particulate pollution - distinct from NO2 - is blamed by Public Health England for about 30,000 premature deaths a year. 
That estimate was expected to double to 60,000 annual deaths last year to take into account the additional impact of NO2. However, the government committee working on the science concluded in December that so far it has proved too hard to separate deaths from particulates known as PM2.5s and those from NO2. 
Despite the difficulty of distinguishing between the two, it said that "it would be sensible to regard NO2 as causing some of the health impact found to be associated with it in epidemiological studies."

Bafta 2016 nominations: Bridge of Spies soars and Carol feels the love; 
Tom Hanks might have lost out on a best actor nod for Bridge of Spies, but Steven Spielberg's drama looks set to clean up at this year's awards, along with Todd Haynes' love story Carol and the Leonardo DiCaprio frontier thriller The Revenant.

Andrew Pulver.

Looking bright and breezy, Bafta host Stephen Fry and Belle actor Gugu Mbatha-Raw made the traditional early morning announcement of the film award nominations. And if Bafta's current position as a key fixture on the awards circuit is anything to go by, Carol, Bridge of Spies and The Revenant look set to clean up this awards season.

                     Carol, the British-produced drama adapted from Patricia Highsmith's once-controversial novel The Price of Salt, is joint leader in the Bafta nominations list with nine, tied with Steven Spielberg's much-admired Bridge of Spies, which chronicles the cold war power plays behind the U-2 Gary Powers incident. The former is set in the early 1950s, and the latter in the early 60s, but both are redolent of a certain era of US power and prestige, and the faultlines that ran beneath it.
Bafta has been generous in its recognition of Carol, with all of its headline talent getting nods: actors Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara (although the latter, as had been somewhat controversially suggested by the film's own awards campaign, ended up in the supporting category), director Todd Haynes and screenwriter Phyllis Nagy, as well as for best film. In contrast, Bridge of Spies lead actor Tom Hanks has not made the shortlist for the main acting award, but director Spielberg has for best director and Mark Rylance has for best supporting actor, which may make him and overwhelming favourite to take the statuette.
In third place, with eight nominations, The Revenant has seen off Quentin Tarantino's western The Hateful Eight - its closest competitor in terms of content and style - as well as early awards-favourite Spotlight, each of which took three nods. The Revenant has been praised for its delicate, haunting beauty and the visceral brutality of its story, which follows the struggle for survival of old-west frontiersman Hugh Glass after a bear attack. It may yet provide a long-hankered-for Oscar for its lead actor, Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio seems nicely placed to take home the best actor Bafta, but he will have serious competition from Michael Fassbender for Steve Jobs. The latter's stock will presumably be higher among British voters.
The Revenant's director, Alejandro Gonz·lez IÒ·rritu said in a statement: "I am thrilled our film has been recognised by Bafta and I want to thank them for this honour. I am so happy for Leo, Tom and our entire cast and crew whose passion and hard work on this film was unparalleled." 
 Related:  Baftas 2016: full list of nominations
The Hateful Eight, which like The Revenant conducts its 19th-century ferocity in a snowbound setting, has to content itself with nominations for Jennifer Jason Leigh (a supporting actress nod for her extraordinary turn as a much-abused prisoner), soundtrack, and screenplay for Tarantino (who missed out in the best director category). Spotlight, the powerful drama about journalists investigating Boston's clerical child abuse scandal, managed a best supporting actor nod for Mark Ruffalo and best picture, but no nominations for Michael Keaton or director Tom McCarthy. 
Another film to disappoint after much awards season talk is Room, which took expected nods for Brie Larson (best actress) and adapted screenplay, but fell short in other categories in which it may have expected to make headway, such as best film and best director. And while it secured seven nominations, Mad Max: Fury Road failed to make an impact outside the craft nominations, with nothing for its actors and director. 
Some films, however, found their prospects enhanced. The Big Short, which chronicled the 2008 financial meltdown in nimble detail, took five nominations, including best supporting actor for Christian Bale, best film and best director. The Martian, unlike Mad Max, made headway in the headline categories, including best actor for Matt Damon and best director for Ridley Scott.
Whether that latter nod turns out to be an act of sentimental British recognition remains to be seen after the Golden Globes and Oscars make their decisions known. Kate Winslet achieved a not-unexpected nod for her role in Steve Jobs, a definite possibility for the Academy awards. However, it is not likely they will find room for Julie Walters, a British TV favourite, who unexpectedly turned up in the best supporting actress category for Brooklyn, and Maggie Smith as best actress for the Alan Bennett adaptation The Lady in the Van. 
In a statement, Winslet said: "To be nominated by my fellow Brits really means a great deal to me; and to be alongside such wonderful women too. This is such a great year for women in film and I am absolutely thrilled to be included!" Walters also released a statement, saying: "What a wonderful surprise, thrilled to be nominated. And proud to be included alongside these great women and their powerful performances." 
That latter nomination would seem to be at the expense of another British favourite, Charlotte Rampling, who has won considerable plaudits for her heartrending performance in 45 Years but has not found favour with Bafta voters.

After its overwhelmingly positive reviews, 45 Years may have expected more than a single nod in the outstanding British film category, but some other British-made films did not fare especially well. Suffragette was ignored entirely, as was the 007 adventure Spectre and the Krays biopic Legend, while outside bets such as Far from the Madding Crowd didn't materialise. One film that did, however, was Alex Garland's sci-fi yarn Ex Machina, which took five nods, including two for Garland himself (screenplay and outstanding debut by a British writer, director producer) and supporting actress for Alicia Vikander. Vikander also features in the best actress list for The Danish Girl, which performed as expected with five nominations, including Eddie Redmayne, as transgender pioneer Lili Elbe, looking to follow up last year's best actor win for The Theory of Everything.
Elsewhere, the Pixar film Inside Out broke out of the animation category as it scooped a best screenplay nomination, and Star Wars: The Force Awakens followed its stunning commercial success by taking four nominations, including original music and special visual effects.
The Bafta ceremony takes place on 14 February at London's Royal Opera House.

Cheltenham house with Banksy wall art up for sale; 
Grade II listed house close to GCHQ featuring street artist's Spy Booth on sale for £210,000.

Steven Morris.

According to the estate agents' blurb, the Victorian house boasts three bedrooms, a kitchen/breakfast room, bathroom with a coloured suite - and a genuine Banksy on the gable wall. 
An end-of-terrace house in Cheltenham with one of the street artist's most famous recent works is up for sale for £210,000. 
It became one of most Britain's most photographed homes after Banksy used it as his canvas in 2014 to create a piece that came to be known as Spy Booth. 
 Close to the surveillance agency GCHQ, it features three spooks in trenchcoats and sunglasses, equipped with listening devices, surrounding a phone box. 
 It appeared after the revelations of surveillance by GCHQ and the National Security Agency revealed by the whistleblower Edward Snowden.
 Banksy confirmed the work was his and the house has been granted Grade II status, which means the new owner will not be able to cash in by removing the work and selling it on. 
Though the Banksy is finished and does not need improvement, the house does need a bit of work. The estate agents, Peter Ball & Co, said: "The property is being offered for sale with no onward chain and requires a comprehensive schedule of refurbishment."
