Junior doctors held a "meet the public" stall outside the Arndale shopping centre in the heart of Manchester.
Dr Marianne Hilton, 36, described the new contract for junior doctors as a "step towards dismantlement of the NHS". A qualified GP registrar since 2007, Hilton said the NHS is now at breaking point and that she no longer feels able to uphold the oath she took when she qualified, to "do no harm". She said:
If it [the new contract] goes through I can no longer honour the oath I took to 'do no harm' - I'm exhausted and you don't have the safeguards in place and you're constantly bombarded with negativity by some of the media. It has become too much.

The BMA has said junior doctors who broke the strike at Sandwell hospital in the Midlands, after the trust asked them to do so to help with extra demand, are likely to have done so in the face of significant pressure. 
A spokeswoman said:
We know from the ground that not all junior doctors returned to work. Those that did were likely to have done so due to the pressure placed upon them. There was still however, a significant presence from junior doctors at the picket lines throughout the day.

The World Medical Association (WMA), which represents physicians from different countries, has backed today's strike action. 
The WMA president, Sir Michael Marmot, said it was the organisation's policy that physicians might carry out protest action and sanctions in order to improve direct and indirect working conditions that might also affect patient care.
He added: 
In this case it is clear that patient care would suffer in the long term if the government's proposals to change the working hours of junior doctors goes ahead.
We note the widespread support given to junior doctors among the public and across the National Health Service and we would urge the British government to establish a new working relationship with junior doctors. It is essential that trust is restored on both sides for the sake of patient care.

Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust has issued a new statement saying they are still calling for striking doctors to return to work but hope that by the end of the afternoon (the walkout is due to end at 8pm) they can stand down the "site recall".
The trust says it has acted as it did because of "considerable and unusual pressure" , rebutting the idea that their move was a cynical ploy to break the strike. It also impled that a number of trainees did comply.
Chief executive Toby Lewis said: 
The Sandwell site remains under considerable pressure with 15% additional beds open after a week of very considerable demand from sick patients needing our care. The trainee doctors that attended exceptionally, and those pre-agreed to be there, have helped greatly today, along with consultant colleagues, to de-escalate the site.
We are optimistic that towards the end of this afternoon we will have achieved our discharge aims. That will provide a safe hospital overnight and tomorrow and we can stand down our site recall.
It is important to be clear that today has not been a major incident, but has been one of considerable and unusual pressure and we have acted, on clinical advice, to ensure that the position does not deteriorate, become potentially unsafe and destabilising neighbouring hospitals and GP services.

Today's blogpost from Roy Lilley, the blogger that people in the NHS take most seriously (including the top brass such as NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens), excoriates Jeremy Hunt for his handling of the junior doctors' dispute, sticks it to the BMA too (though less so) and depicts the bosses of NHS hospital trusts as important people rendered frustratingly powerless by events that affect them directly. 
All the hospital bosses he's spoken to -- and he's very well-connected -- "are sick to the back teeth of the dispute and want to know who's going to pay for it. Trust boards are very cross", Lilley writes. 
Who does he blame? Jeremy Hunt -- or the Tinkerman, as he likes to call him. 
It seems to me, there are two main issues in play. First, the Tinkerman's frustration that discussions about modernising the 2009 contract started back in 2012, got nowhere. Thus, he announced if progress wasn't made he would impose a settlement. That was a really stupid thing to do. I have no idea who advised him to do that but they are to industrial relations what Jeremy Clarkson is to the caravan trade. 
The second key issue? 
The Tory election promise, to extend NHS working to seamless-seven-days, creates an imperative to change junior doctors' out-of-hours/premium/overtime payments (call it what you will) to make it affordable within the existing cost envelope. This generates complexity around just how much they will earn and a working environment the docs don't trust. 
Ever robust in his views, Lilley sympathises with the bosses of hospitals, caught in the middle of a potentially protracted series of industrial action, whose job is difficult enough already. The end result of all this, he says, is that 
The row is about a political imperative (fair enough it's a democracy), over which the employers have no say, who have been forced into a dispute with the workforce union they don't want, who are railing against the Department of Health, who are not the employer, but calling the shots and the actual employer has to handle the fall-out. Is that clear?

Outside South Kensington tube station in London, dozens of junior doctors are gathered with placards from three famous local hospitals - the Chelsea and Westminster, the Royal Brompton chest hospital and the Royal Marsden cancer hospital. Every now and then a massive cheer goes up as passing cars beep in support.
The hospital consultants covering for the juniors have also been hugely supportive, says Lily Collins, an F2 junior currently working in community psychiatry at the Chelsea and Westminster:
All the consultants have been so much behind us. They are the ones taking up the slack. They are doing our discharge summaries and saying we didn't realise how hard you guys work.
But, she says, "it's a misconception that we are not at work. It is the same level of cover as on Christmas Day". 
There are juniors who are on call, who are joining the picket line when they are not needed. Most of the public were very supportive, she said, but there had been a mixed reception. "You can't expect everyone to be onboard, but we try to get them to understand the reasons."
Maria Walsh, also in her second year out of medical school, working in anaesthetics at the Royal Marsden, said it was a patient safety issue. "I wouldn't want to be operated on by someone who has worked a 12 hour shift," she said.
"We are already over-stretched. We work extra hours out of goodwill.It goes with the job." But under the proposed new contract, "there is nothing to stop the trusts overworking us", she said.
The temperature had dropped and Collins was shivering. "But I'm going to be here until I'm too cold to survive," she laughed.

The picket at Sandwell, where junior doctors were ordered back, has now dispersed - the agreement was that they would stay until lunchtime. Doctors insisted they would have put down their placards and headed inside to help if there had been a genuine emergency. Some believe the trust was trying to "trick" them into going back to work. 
Speaking at the picket line before they packed away, Dr Anne De Bray, who has worked at the hospital for a year, said: 
My first reaction was to cry when they called us back in. I was really frustrated and sad that they were trying to call us back into work. 
There have been quite a few letters over the past week explaining the measures they were going to take to cover the strike. 
It's been well planned. They said they would call us individually if they needed us to come back into work. Instead they've emailed us a letter that was dated yesterday (Monday) 15 minutes before our picket line was due to start. I just think they've not done it through the proper channels. 
If there was a dangerous incident they should liaise with the BMA through NHS England to call off the strike. It's really busy in there and staying in hospital for longer is not ideal for any patient. 
If there had been a major incident like a terrorist attack or road accident we would drop our placards and head in. We have all brought out stethoscopes and a change of clothes. 
But the BMA have said there's no danger to patients. My team finished at 7pm three days last week, we were due to finish at 4pm. We do this and we don't get paid for it. 
 Another junior doctor, who did not want to be named, added: 
It is disgraceful they've tried to trick us back into work. The sad thing is some doctors would have fallen for it and gone back in. 
There is no major incident. It is just busy which they have known about for a long time so they had plenty of time to put arrangements in place.

Kearney points out that this is the first doctors strike in 40 years and asked Hunt if he felt responsible.
Hunt cites more examples of higher death rates at weekends. "I can't in all consciousness ignore those studies, we've had three in the last two months. We have to do something about this. People get ill every day of the week," he said.
Patient safety is not at risk by the removal of some of the current safeguards, like financial penalties for trusts that overwork doctors, he insisted. "Why would I want to do that? This new contract reduces the number of hours junior doctors are required to work. We actually offered to put in financial penalties. 
"The BMA wanted the penalties to go to the junior doctors, and we say... you're creating a perverse incentive to actually work those hours that are too long."

"It's very disappointing," Hunt told the BBC's Martha Kearney.

At the moment, if you have a stroke at the weekends, you're 20% more likely to die. That cannot be right, and that's something every doctor wants to do.
The right thing to do is to sit round the table and talk to the Government about how we improve patient safety and patient care, not these very unnecessary strikes.

 More than 150 pickets and related events - BMA  
The BMA says there have been more more than 150 pickets and "meet the doctor" events across England. It has also condemned attempts to "bully" doctors back to work.
 Dr Johann Malawana, BMA junior doctors committee chair, said:
With junior doctors attending more than 150 pickets and 'meet the doctor' events 1 up and down England, today's action sends a clear message to Jeremy Hunt and David Cameron. Junior doctors in their thousands have made it quite clear what they think of the government's plans to impose contracts in which junior doctors have no confidence.
"Today's action - one that the BMA has long sought to avoid - is a result of a fundamental breakdown in trust with junior doctors, for which the government is directly responsible. This has only been made worse by yesterday's last minute, inept and heavy-handed attempts to bully junior doctors lawfully taking industrial action back into work. 2
We deeply regret the level of disruption caused, but this is a fight for the long term safety of patients and junior doctors' working lives. The biggest threat to patient care is the government's insistence on removing safeguards which prevent junior doctors from being forced to work dangerously long hours without breaks, with patients facing the prospect of being treated by exhausted doctors.

Andy, who had been at Tooting Broadway tube station earlier said there was a bone marrow registry post there today, giving doctors taking industrial action a chance to do things they don't usually get to, such as signing up as donors. He said:
As well as standing outside picket lines we want to make a positive impact today and do things we don't use get to, like getting doctors to join the bone marrow register and potentially save treatment.
These are measure we've been forced to take. The contract is not safe.

A junior doctor working for the Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust, where strikers were told to go back to work because of high demand, has questioned why the situation has been labelled an emergency. The medic, who wished to remain anonymous, told the Guardian:
We received the letter emailed to us this morning, but it was dated yesterday and it said the situation had been ongoing for some days.
We were not called in at the weekends to provide extra cover to discharge patients so why are we getting called in now? People called the BMA after they got the letters and we were told not to go back in.
This kind of situation happens all the time, especially in winter, over the whole NHS. You'd expect it to happen several times a year, it's not at all unusual. I would imagine it's the same situation with hospitals across the country, it happens very frequently. 
So it's odd that this has happened to junior doctors on the day of the strike, when the issue of discharges has been going on for a few days.

Since the dispute began in mid-September there has been a lot of confusion about who exactly counts as a "junior doctor". Quite a few people have assumed that the term refers to only young trainee doctors, fresh out of medical school, or those in the very early stages of training after graduation that -- after about 15 years -- usually results in doctors at last becoming senior doctors, ie consultants. 
Some newspapers certainly gave that impression, at least early on in this now long-running contract row. It's an easy mistake to make, especially when so many of the junior doctors who have given interviews to broadcast media have looked to be in their early 20s. However, actually far, far more doctors than that are classed, arguably unhelpfully, as "junior" doctors. 
So, to (try and) be clear: in the NHS, a "junior" doctor is any level or grade of doctor below a consultant. So any medic who is a Foundation Year 1 or 2 doctor, or house officer or senior house officer, or registrar or senior registrar -- the last stop before consultant status -- is a "junior" doctor, even if s/he is in their mid or even late 30s. Or, sometimes, in their 40s. 
There are about 45,000 of them in the NHS in England, of whom 38,000 belong to the BMA, and it was 98% of them that voted in November to strike in protest at the proposed new contract. 
It's easy for anyone not in the NHS or au fait with how medicine works to assume that "junior" doctors are all fairly young. To add to that confusion, all junior doctors are -- technically at least -- trainee doctors until they become a consultant, even if they are highly skilled and potentially in charge of busy wards full of medically needy patients, for example, as quite a few often are. A few readers have taken issue with me for referring in stories to junior doctors being "trainee doctors", which was my way of avoiding undue and potentially tedious repetition of the phrase "junior doctors". In my view medicine's crude distinction between junior and senior (consultant) doctors, shored up by a series of acronyms that denote (to insiders) how far a particular junior doctor has reached in their training, is outmoded, open to (clearly) misinterpretation and also patronising and wildly hierarchical. Surely someone can come up with a better way of telling the world how experienced (or not) a doctor is? 
But technically I am right to refer to them as all being trainees, though I recognise how imperfect that is. The phrase I've used in many of my stories about the dispute over recent months, to try and convey the range of doctors covered by the term junior doctor, is "all doctors below the level of consultant". That's who they are, all 45,000 of them.

Striking junior doctors outside St George's hospital in Tooting, south-west London, have a smiling poo depicting health secretary Jeremy Hunt. 
The green posters that the striking doctors, some wearing their scrubs, were holding read: "We are one profession. We stand together."
Some doctors said they had "never done anything like this" before. 
Unlike the previous strike by nurses at the hospital, there was little singing or chanting outside the gates. No megaphone. It was an austere strike by doctors, some who have worked in the profession for many years, yet who feel the health service is coming under severe pressure. 
Holding aloft a smiling poo emoji that was meant to be a visual representation of Jeremy Hunt, Emily, a junior doctor, with a stethoscope around her neck, said: 
We get a lot of rubbish thrown at us.
We're intelligent people and now is the time to stand together. We believe we deserve to be treated better and support our colleagues as well.
Some colleagues wished them good luck, others brought out cups of tea for the striking doctors of the hospital, which has around 1000 hospital beds and is known for providing regional and national specialist care in cardiac, neurosurgery and cancer services areas..

Justin Madders, a member of Labour's shadow health team, writes in the New Statesman today:
Speak to any junior doctor and they'll tell you the last thing they want to be doing is withdrawing their labour, but the truth is they feel like Jeremy Hunt has backed them into a corner and left them with no other way to get their message across.
 There remains significant concerns with the proposed new contract that the Government is trying to impose on junior doctors - not least the impact on patient safety as a result of junior doctors being forced to work excessively long hours - but today's industrial action has become about so much more.
 Junior doctors tell me they feel like they are the first line of defence for the future of the NHS. They feel like if they don't stand up to the government now, then next it'll be the nurses, the midwives and the healthcare assistants. Whether that assessment is right or wrong, it is a remarkable situation for junior doctors to find themselves in. Trust has been damaged, let us hope it is not irreversible.

With a stethoscope around his neck, Richard Sykes, a senior house officer in elderly care at St George's hospital, said Jeremy Hunt had approached the negotiations "with a sledgehammer". 
The reason that we're striking is we feel the government is trying to impose an unsafe contract on junior doctors which massively squeezes [the NHS] and doctors who feel undervalued and abused by the system.
Jeremy Hunt wants to unilaterally impose a contract which will further stretch tired and overworked junior doctors in a time of austerity.
If Jeremy Hunt had come to us and said: 'Your elderly patients don't all get seen in the weekend and we want to change that', that's a serious rational concern that we could have addressed.
But he's using rubbish statistics to push his own political agenda.
I think stretching what is currently a five-day cover without any more doctors or support services would reduce continuity of care and efficiency.
He said Hunt was using "intellectually immoral" arguments to suggest there was not a seven-day NHS, and calling for the same services on weekends as weekdays without providing the infrastructure. 
As Sykes handed a passerby a leaflet he said: "Sorry we're not at work today."

Handing out stickers to passersby outside St George's hospital in the bitter cold, Miranda Lewis a GP trainee who has been at the hospital for 18 months said: 
I think it's really sad that it's come to this but unfortunately we have to take this extreme action after negotiations broke down. It's all about patient safety. And for juniors coming through we have to protect the NHS. 
Today my ward has four consultants. So more doctors with experience so I have no doubt patients will be looked after. We're sorry patients have had routine checks and operations rescheduled. 
Most of these people coming in are staff. Some came in before 8am to do checks. We're feeling slightly undervalued and work above and beyond the care of duty. The smear campaign by government and in the media makes us feel so undervalued. 
As staff passed around cups of coffee to keep doctors warm, James Barr, cardiothoracic registrar, told the Guardian: 
The infrastructure is not there, the beds are not there. We run a seven day service. I think the issue is in our service we struggle to run a five day service.
We run electives Monday to Friday. The idea of rolling out elective and clinical every day, it will be difficult and affect training of staff. And there will be less continuity of care. The research isn't there.
At the moment it is being run on a shoestring. Compared to France and Germany the proportion of GDP spent on healthcare much lower.
Also it will be hard to attract students when will leave with a huge student debt of £80k and starting salary of £22k.

This contract change is just one stand of the Government's attack on our NHS. Student nurses have had their grants snatched away - and costly NHS marketisation is continuing. Now junior doctors are making a stand against the bully boys in the Cabinet.

A lot of us are just fed up with constant worsening of our pay, our conditions. There was the changes to our pensions, the continued pay freeze across the entire public sector. We've found it to be the last straw. It endangers patients as we will be working much longer hours. Also it endangers our quality of life, if they aren't going to pay us any extra to come in on Saturday and Sundays when we're already working full shifts, nights, weekends anyway and it's making us work harder and harder for less and less money.

 BMA says Sandwell doctors shouldn't go back  
The BMA has advised its junior doctors not to respond to the request by Sandwell hospital for some of them to return to work because of high demand. 
The hospital said: "We decided to require trainee doctors allocated to ward work to attend Sandwell during today's strike."
A BMA spokesman said: 
Junior doctors should continue with industrial action until NHS England has confirmed and the BMA has agreed - via the agreed escalation process - that a major unpredictable incident is taking place for a specific Trust. The BMA will notify members as soon as such an incident is in place.
 It also referred strikers to its legal advice on the issue.

Prianka Padmanathan, 26, had tears in her eyes as she explained why she was on the picket line outside Bristol royal infirmary rather than at work.
It feels horrible but I don't think we have any choice. The new contract doesn't have in place the safeguards to stop us working dangerous and excessive hours. I feel that it's unsafe for the patients.
The government is selling it as creating a seven-day NHS. The problem is they are not prepared to provide any extra resources - no extra doctors or nurses, porters or anyone else. I don't think it's possible to improve services this way.
Padmanathan is a foundation year-two doctor undertaking research at Bristol University and working in the medical admissions unit at the BRI. She said most of her contemporaries would not be working in the UK in the next few years but heading abroad.
There's already a huge recruitment crisis among doctors. Under this new contract it will become almost impossible. Out of my year group there's about 40 of us. I know about five who have applied for a job in the UK. The majority are planning on travelling abroad. They are so worried about the situation. Hopefully we may persuade some of them to come back. I know the majority out in New Zealand and Australia won't come back.
Sarah Ibitoye, 29, an acute medicine registrar at the BRI, said: 
We feel we've come to the end of the road. Even though it's not what we want to do, we feel we have no other choice. It doesn't feel very nice being on strike. It's the first time I've ever done anything like this. Like all my colleagues I do this job because I love it. I like trying to help people; the idea of being out here not doing my usual job is not a nice feeling.
At the moment the hours I work are tough but they are OK. There are already shortages. I work in the respiratory department. That has taken its toll. We do often stay after our rota hours to get the work done. My fear is that if a lot of people who are threatening to leave the country do so, next year will be even worse. There will be far more shortages, the chances of staying late will increase. At least now we know if we stay late those hours are monitored. The trust investigates why we go over our monitored hours and try to make changes. If that monitoring is gone, the ability to recognise a problem and make a change will be gone. That is frightening really. I know when I'm tired I'm not as effective in my job. I don't want to put myself in that position where I feel I'm doing extra hours all the time and it changes the way I work.
Luke Carter, 27, a core medical trainee, said: 
I'm against the government's ideological push towards privatisation. If they get this contract for junior doctors through, the consultants will be next. If there's a new consultant contract, that will be the end of the NHS as we know it. We're lucky as doctors - we have a voice, we can fend for ourselves. But there's a lot of people in society who don't have that voice - who are being trampled on by the government. We do a difficult job. We get paid well. But I think the government should be honest if it wants us to work longer hours. If that's what they want, they should say that.
Elsewhere in the city there were pickets outside Bristol's famous children's hospital, the maternity unit St Michael's and the eye hospital.
Lin Clark, a retired public services worker, arrived with (slightly burnt) mince pies. "I was in hospital with my mother recently and I see how hard the junior doctors work," she said. "I'm 100% behind them. This new contract is all about the government privatising the NHS."

"I've not marched since I was a student but I was radicalised as a result of Andrew Lansley's Health & Social Care Act - it's a direct assault on the principles of the NHS," he said on the picket line with junior doctors from Stepping Hill hospital in Stockport. 
He added: 
The greatest threat to patient safety is cuts in funding, putting things out to market. The private sectors picks things up and puts them down. The Tories' plans are a frontal assault on the values of the NHS - it's a war of values against prices.

 Midlands hospital orders striking doctors in  
Sandwell hospital in the West Midlands says it has ordered some of its junior doctors to come to work because of high demand.
Dr Roger Stedman, medical director at Sandwell and West Birmingham hospitals NHS trust, said: 
Over the last two days we have had very high numbers of patients come to hospital, and fewer than usual discharged. 
Because of that we decided to require trainee doctors allocated to ward work to attend Sandwell during today's strike. Staff taking action at City are unaffected. We would like to thank local doctors' representatives for their constructive support and advice.

Andy Beamish, surgical registrar based in Sweden is back in the UK to support strike action. He splits his time at the royal college of surgeons and a hospital in Gothenburg. 
Holding leaflets that read "we are one profession we stand together" and dressed in his scrubs, Beamish said: 
I'm here because I believe so strongly what the Department of Health, Jeremy Hunt and the government is doing is so detrimental to patient care and the NHS as an institution and also as a sideline to us and working patterns.
It will be so damaging to those things that not causing a minor disruption today would be immoral and letting things go the way they are.
After a few years in surgery, and I know from many years of experience, sometimes an operation can kill someone. You need to make decisions knowing you're capable and not exhausted working 13 hour shifts.
It's dangerous not just to my patients and the NHS, but to us. Driving home late after a shift and our concentration levels is compared [as dangerous as] to drink driving.

At St Thomas's hospital in central London the 20-odd junior doctors on the picket line have been joined by members of the Lambeth branch of the Keep Our NHS Public campaign group, several people from the National Gallery Former Strikers group and a few members of the PCS union.
The hospital's location, opposite the Palace of Westminster, means there are also a few journalists including Robert Peston, now of ITV, and his crew. The mood is upbeat as a few motorists crossing Westminster Bridge toot their support. One British Medical Association steward helps picketers - most of them in their scrubs with stethoscopes around their necks - forget the cold by handing round a box of croissants and Jaffa Cakes.
A delegation of senior Green party figures, including Caroline Lucas MP and leader Natalie Bennett, got a warm reception from junior doctors glad of some political support.
In his thick winter coat, gloves and BMA armband, Dr William Turner, a 31-year-old trainee anaesthetist, is one of the junior doctors on strike.
His main worry, he says, is that the proposed new contract will result in a 30% pay cut and remove safeguards that currently prevent juniors being forced by their hospital to work dangerously long hours. 
That will lead to doctors potentially working 80 to 90 hours a week. That will result in tired doctors on the wards and we know that tired doctors make mistakes, so ultimately it's putting patients' lives at risk.
Turner's normal working day involves learning his trade during operations of all sorts, from a hernia repair to a bowel resection, lasting between four and 10 hours.
The best kind of strike is one where you don't have to deliver [actually walk out]. We are all here today with a heavy heart. No junior doctor goes on strike lightly. It takes an awful lot to push junior doctors into the position where they are ready to stand on the picket line and not treat patients. But that's the position we are in because we have been pushed into it by the government.

Jon Skewes, director of policy, employment relations and communications at the RCM, said: 
We stand shoulder to shoulder with our NHS colleagues on this issue, and the Royal College of Midwives offers its support to the junior doctors. Like midwives who took strike action over the past year I know that patient safety will be the number one priority for the junior doctors, and that steps will be taken to ensure that those who need care will receive it.
These hard working health professionals are facing attacks on their pay, including on payment for working unsocial hours. This is also an issue facing midwives and other health professionals in the NHS, who are facing being paid less for working in the evening, weekends and at night.

Sophie Herbert, a junior doctor at St George's hospital in Tooting, south London, said: 
I'm here because the government had failed to offer meaningful negotiations about a contract that is unsafe.
They are making the working conditions for doctors and nurses so difficult that there's an exodus of these highly trained individuals to other countries and careers. We're already contending with overwhelming staff shortages and we are already at breaking point, we can't do any more. That is why we're here.

Today's strike isn't just affecting acute hospital trusts. Mental health services are being disrupted too. 
Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health NHS Trust, in north-east London, expected three-quarters of its 65 junior doctors to be on strike today. "We are anticipating around 75% of the 65 juniors to take industrial action. A small number are choosing not to strike, including some vacant junior doctor posts which are filled by locus", it said in a statement. It has cancelled some routine community and outpatient clinics "to minimise patient inconvenience", though stresses that all essential services will be covered by appropriate staff. 
In addition, "services for children and adolescents, working age adults and older people are all affected in some way by the industrial action. Planned outpatient appointments and domiciliary visits have been postponed and rearranged where possible, and consultants and specialty doctors are stepping in to support the safe provision of the service", adds the trust, which treats 155,000 people a year at its more than 40 sites 
Dr Jonathan Bindman, its medical director, said: 
Thanks to the goodwill of our consultant colleagues we are able to cover a good number of the essential junior doctors' roles. Of course, services like emergency assessments will be unaffected, and we will endeavour to provide as comprehensive a service as possible in the circumstances. In addition, we are ensuring that essential inpatient services will be covered by consultants, so care for our most vulnerable patients will not be affected. 
It is a similar picture across the capital at the South London and the Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, the NHS's largest mental health trust: 
During the industrial action, the trust is planning to deliver a reduced service that will cover emergency services only (similar to Christmas Day cover). This will include emergency admissions, place of safety suites, and psychiatric liaison support in our partner trusts' accident and emergency departments through on-call arrangements. Across the trust, this may mean that some routine clinics and community services could be cancelled.
Whilst we will not be running a full service, consultants will be working with nursing staff and other health professionals to ensure that patient care is not compromised. The trust employs 225 junior doctors and we recognise the right of these staff to take part in industrial action following the recent BMA ballot", the trust said in a statement.

Doctors do not have a mass media machine. We do not have the powers of spin at the disposal of the Department of Health. What we do have is years of training in the evaluation of evidence and communication with people. Today, I will use these skills in a new way.
I will be outside my local tube station taking part in a nationwide campaign called Meet the Doctors. I will offer, to anyone who wishes to listen, to explain all of the issues that have led us to this situation.
No spin, just facts. I will explain how the removal of safeguards on doctors' working hours will put patients at risk, how we already have a seven-day NHS, how I already work weekends and nights, and that the new contract will not change this. I will explain that doctors are working at the very limit of what is possible and that a move to stretch them further is dangerous.
I will say that we have tried to explain all of this to the government, that we tried negotiating and they did not listen, that 20,000 of us marched in the streets of London and they did not listen, that 98% of us voted for the strike because this contract is so unsafe and unfair, and still  they will not listen. I will explain we are left with no choice but to take industrial action.

Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, the NHS medical director, has told hospitals to order doctors back to work if services become dangerously overstretched. In a letter to the directors of NHS, published by the Telegraph, he said doctors should be told to return if there is an  "exceptional and sustained deterioration in performance".
The BMA said Keogh was meddling with their right to strike.
Sir Robert Francis QC, who led the inquiry into the Mid Staffordshire scandal and a non-executive director of the Care Quality Commission, said industrial action would only "compromise patient safety".
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme he said:

While Labour and the Liberal Democrats are sympathetic towards the junior doctors, they are not 100% behind them. Two parties have no such equivocation, though. They are the Green Party and, unsurprisingly, the National Health Action Party (NHAP), the small party dedicated to saving the NHS which fielded some candidates at last May's general election. 
Caroline Lucas, the Greens' only MP, and other leading party figures will show their support for the striking doctors today by joining the picket line at St Thomas's hospital in central London, directly opposite the Palace of Westminster on the other side of the Thames. 
The Brighton Pavilion MP sees today's strike as "healthcare professionals standing up to the bully boys around the Cabinet table. We fully support the action being taken by junior doctors today. This strike is happening because the government is failing to address very serious concerns around safe working conditions, while failing to offer proper recognition for those working unsocial hours," she said. Lucas added: 
Ministers have treated junior doctors with contempt and subjected them to a campaign of misinformation. It's no wonder they're at the end of their tether. This contract change is part of a wider government assault on our health service. 
She will be joined outside St Thomas's by Natalie Bennett, the Green Party leader; Baroness Jenny Jones, a London Assembly member and Sian Berry, the party's candidate to become Mayor of London. 
NHAP co-leader Dr Clive Peedell, an NHS oncologist, says the strike is "a referendum on the government's stewardship of the NHS". 
In his view: 
Junior doctors have been left with no choice but to take industrial action. The government has not compromised on its agenda to force junior doctors into working more hours for less pay, so that it can drive through its 'enhanced seven-day services' manifesto pledge which makes no sense in the context of a £22bn NHS efficiency savings program.
Peedell, who will be on the picket line outside University College London Hospital today, added: 
Despite the rhetoric from the Department of Health and NHS Employers, this remains an unfair and unsafe contract. Any potential inconvenience caused to patients by industrial action will be minor in comparison to the catastrophic long term risks to patient care resulting from an exodus of NHS juniors doctors if this contract is imposed. 
block-time published-time 7.39am GMT 
At 8am, today junior doctors begin the first in a series of three strikes over planned changes to their contract - the first walkout by junior doctors in 40 years. The dispute between the British Medical Association, which represents 38,000 of the 45,000 junior doctors in England, and the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has become increasingly embittered and this time, unlike when a previous walkout planned for 1 December, there has been no last minute reprieve. 
On Monday, NHS England said that 1,425 inpatient operations and procedures had been cancelled as a result of the strike alongside 2,535 outpatient ones. It said that 3,400 of the cancellations were today and 654 - 192 inpatients and 462 day cases - are in London. 
The postponed operations amount to about 13% of the normal daily total of 30,000. 
Across Greater Manchester, more than half (54%) of planned surgery and "non-urgent day-cases" have been cancelled. Approximately 11% out-patient appointments have also been cancelled.
Emergency care is excluded from today's industrial action but is likely to be affected nevertheless with NHS England saying hospitals would generally be under additional pressure.
There are believed to be around 100 pickets, at least, planned outside hospitals.
We will be providing live updates from picket lines and on how the NHS is coping at a time when increased winter demand has already put a strain on services.

Sandwell hospital orders striking junior doctors to return to wards; 
Midlands hospital declares level four incident but BMA advises medics to defy order amid strike over new contract.

Jessica Elgot, Matthew Weaver, Denis Campbell and Haroon Siddique.

Junior doctors have been told to defy orders from a West Midlands hospital to return to their wards just two hours into strike action because of pressure on services.
In the first strike by hospital doctors in 40 years, up to 38,000 members of the British Medical Association (BMA) across England began the action at 8am on Tuesday. The 24-hour strike over a new pay and working hours contract being proposed by the government has meant hospitals have rescheduled about 4,000 non-emergency operations, 13% of the normal daily total. 
The doctors have agreed to provide emergency care for the first of two planned strikes this month but have threatened to withdraw those services in a third strike in February. 
Within two hours of the start of the strike, Sandwell hospital in West Bromwich said it had declared a level four incident and told its junior doctors they must attend work. But the BMA said they should refuse to do so until the seriousness of the situation had been established through the correct process. 
A letter from the trust, dated Monday, warned doctors rostered on for Tuesday that they should report for duty and said the hospital was already at escalation level four. "There are over 50 additional adult beds open with further medical outliers in surgery," it said.
Dr Roger Stedman, medical director at Sandwell and West Birmingham hospitals NHS trust, said Sandwell had had very high numbers of patients come to the hospital, and fewer than usual discharged. Staff striking at Birmingham City hospital were unaffected, he added.
The BMA said it was advising doctors not to return to work until the seriousness of the situation had been established.
"Junior doctors should continue with industrial action until NHS England has confirmed and the BMA has agreed - via the agreed escalation process - that a major unpredictable incident is taking place for a specific trust," a spokesman said. 
Anne Rainsberry, national incident director for NHS England, said the request for doctors to return was in line with the local agreement between the trust and the BMA. 
"Sandwell hospital has reported that it has been experiencing exceptional and sustained pressure," she said. "The local NHS is actively reviewing the situation to support the trust. Nationally, we are continuing to work closely with our BMA colleagues to ensure patient safety." 
Earlier, Prof Sir Bruce Keogh, the NHS medical director, told hospitals they should order doctors back to work if services became dangerously overstretched.
In a letter to NHS trusts published by the Telegraph, Keogh said on Monday that doctors should be told to return if there was an "exceptional and sustained deterioration in performance", which the BMA said was meddling with doctors' right to strike.
Stedman said doctors' representatives in Birmingham had given "constructive support and advice" before the decision was taken to order doctors back to the wards at Sandwell.

Government ministers have declined to comment on the strike since it began, leaving the NHS director to defend the employers' position. 
The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, urged ministers to apologise for the failure to avert a strike. In a post on Facebook he wrote: "No NHS worker takes lightly the decision to strike, but the blame must be laid at the door of this government for the way it has treated doctors and now seeks to smear them in the press. It is time for this government to apologise to junior doctors and negotiate a fair deal that gets our NHS working again."
Sir Robert Francis QC, who led the inquiry into the Mid Staffordshire scandal and is a non-executive director of the Care Quality Commission, said industrial action would only "compromise patient safety".
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "The only way that matters can be solved for doctors and patients is for talks to continue and for emergency care not to be withdrawn." 
But Francis said the government should listen to doctors and explain their offer more clearly.
"I quite understand why many of them [doctors] feel angry. They need to be listened to. One thing I would ask is done is that a better explanation is given to them all as to what the effects of any offer being made on them is personally. I'm not entirely confident that that has yet happened."
The BMA said it had been forced to act after ministers refused to heed its concerns that the new contract proposed by Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, would be unfair on doctors and reduce patient safety. Approximately 98% of its members backed strike action in a ballot in November.
They are opposed to Hunt's plan to classify Saturday as part of a junior doctor's normal working week for which they are paid at only the basic rate. He also wants to see the portion of weekday evenings classified as normal time extended from 7pm to 10pm, but junior doctors fear this will lead to cuts in their pay.
Hunt has offered to raise junior doctors' basic pay by 11% to offset the loss of overtime they currently earn for working in the evening and on Saturday, and has promised that no junior doctor will be worse off under the new contract, which is due to start in August.

A fresh opinion poll suggests that despite Hunt's efforts to portray the walkout as politically motivated and based on misinformation from the BMA, the public is largely behind the strike. An Ipsos Mori poll for the Health Service Journal found that 66% of 869 people support action such as that planned on Tuesday - where juniors due on duty in emergency care still turn up to work - with only 16% completely against.
Katherine Murphy, the chief executive of the Patients Association, said that while she sympathised with junior doctors, industrial action would cause "a great deal of distress for many patients, who continue to be caught in the middle of this dispute". 
She urged the BMA and ministers to resume talks as soon as possible to agree a deal before the second of three planned strikes, from 26-28 January.

 More than 150 pickets and related events - BMA  
The BMA says there have been more more than 150 pickets and "meet the doctor" events across England. It has also condemned attempts to "bully" doctors back to work.
 Dr Johann Malawana, BMA junior doctors committee chair, said:
With junior doctors attending more than 150 pickets and 'meet the doctor' events 1 up and down England, today's action sends a clear message to Jeremy Hunt and David Cameron. Junior doctors in their thousands have made it quite clear what they think of the government's plans to impose contracts in which junior doctors have no confidence. 
"Today's action - one that the BMA has long sought to avoid - is a result of a fundamental breakdown in trust with junior doctors, for which the government is directly responsible. This has only been made worse by yesterday's last minute, inept and heavy-handed attempts to bully junior doctors lawfully taking industrial action back into work. 2
We deeply regret the level of disruption caused, but this is a fight for the long term safety of patients and junior doctors' working lives. The biggest threat to patient care is the government's insistence on removing safeguards which prevent junior doctors from being forced to work dangerously long hours without breaks, with patients facing the prospect of being treated by exhausted doctors.

Andy, who had been at Tooting Broadway tube station earlier said there was a bone marrow registry post there today, giving doctors taking industrial action a chance to do things they don't usually get to, such as signing up as donors. He said:
As well as standing outside picket lines we want to make a positive impact today and do things we don't use get to, like getting doctors to join the bone marrow register and potentially save treatment.
These are measure we've been forced to take. The contract is not safe.

A junior doctor working for the Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust, where strikers were told to go back to work because of high demand, has questioned why the situation has been labelled an emergency. The medic, who wished to remain anonymous, told the Guardian:
We received the letter emailed to us this morning, but it was dated yesterday and it said the situation had been ongoing for some days.
We were not called in at the weekends to provide extra cover to discharge patients so why are we getting called in now? People called the BMA after they got the letters and we were told not to go back in.
This kind of situation happens all the time, especially in winter, over the whole NHS. You'd expect it to happen several times a year, it's not at all unusual. I would imagine it's the same situation with hospitals across the country, it happens very frequently. 
So it's odd that this has happened to junior doctors on the day of the strike, when the issue of discharges has been going on for a few days.

Since the dispute began in mid-September there has been a lot of confusion about who exactly counts as a "junior doctor". Quite a few people have assumed that the term refers to only young trainee doctors, fresh out of medical school, or those in the very early stages of training after graduation that -- after about 15 years -- usually results in doctors at last becoming senior doctors, ie consultants. 
Some newspapers certainly gave that impression, at least early on in this now long-running contract row. It's an easy mistake to make, especially when so many of the junior doctors who have given interviews to broadcast media have looked to be in their early 20s. However, actually far, far more doctors than that are classed, arguably unhelpfully, as "junior" doctors. 
So, to (try and) be clear: in the NHS, a "junior" doctor is any level or grade of doctor below a consultant. So any medic who is a Foundation Year 1 or 2 doctor, or house officer or senior house officer, or registrar or senior registrar -- the last stop before consultant status -- is a "junior" doctor, even if s/he is in their mid or even late 30s. Or, sometimes, in their 40s. 
There are about 45,000 of them in the NHS in England, of whom 38,000 belong to the BMA, and it was 98% of them that voted in November to strike in protest at the proposed new contract. 
It's easy for anyone not in the NHS or au fait with how medicine works to assume that "junior" doctors are all fairly young. To add to that confusion, all junior doctors are -- technically at least -- trainee doctors until they become a consultant, even if they are highly skilled and potentially in charge of busy wards full of medically needy patients, for example, as quite a few often are. A few readers have taken issue with me for referring in stories to junior doctors being "trainee doctors", which was my way of avoiding undue and potentially tedious repetition of the phrase "junior doctors". In my view medicine's crude distinction between junior and senior (consultant) doctors, shored up by a series of acronyms that denote (to insiders) how far a particular junior doctor has reached in their training, is outmoded, open to (clearly) misinterpretation and also patronising and wildly hierarchical. Surely someone can come up with a better way of telling the world how experienced (or not) a doctor is? 
But technically I am right to refer to them as all being trainees, though I recognise how imperfect that is. The phrase I've used in many of my stories about the dispute over recent months, to try and convey the range of doctors covered by the term junior doctor, is "all doctors below the level of consultant". That's who they are, all 45,000 of them.

Striking junior doctors outside St George's hospital in Tooting, south-west London, have a smiling poo depicting health secretary Jeremy Hunt. 
The green posters that the striking doctors, some wearing their scrubs, were holding read: "We are one profession. We stand together."
Some doctors said they had "never done anything like this" before. 
Unlike the previous strike by nurses at the hospital, there was little singing or chanting outside the gates. No megaphone. It was an austere strike by doctors, some who have worked in the profession for many years, yet who feel the health service is coming under severe pressure. 
Holding aloft a smiling poo emoji that was meant to be a visual representation of Jeremy Hunt, Emily, a junior doctor, with a stethoscope around her neck, said: 
We get a lot of rubbish thrown at us.
We're intelligent people and now is the time to stand together. We believe we deserve to be treated better and support our colleagues as well.
Some colleagues wished them good luck, others brought out cups of tea for the striking doctors of the hospital, which has around 1000 hospital beds and is known for providing regional and national specialist care in cardiac, neurosurgery and cancer services areas..

Justin Madders, a member of Labour's shadow health team, writes in the New Statesman today:
Speak to any junior doctor and they'll tell you the last thing they want to be doing is withdrawing their labour, but the truth is they feel like Jeremy Hunt has backed them into a corner and left them with no other way to get their message across.
 There remains significant concerns with the proposed new contract that the Government is trying to impose on junior doctors - not least the impact on patient safety as a result of junior doctors being forced to work excessively long hours - but today's industrial action has become about so much more.
 Junior doctors tell me they feel like they are the first line of defence for the future of the NHS. They feel like if they don't stand up to the government now, then next it'll be the nurses, the midwives and the healthcare assistants. Whether that assessment is right or wrong, it is a remarkable situation for junior doctors to find themselves in. Trust has been damaged, let us hope it is not irreversible.

With a stethoscope around his neck, Richard Sykes, a senior house officer in elderly care at St George's hospital, said Jeremy Hunt had approached the negotiations "with a sledgehammer". 
The reason that we're striking is we feel the government is trying to impose an unsafe contract on junior doctors which massively squeezes [the NHS] and doctors who feel undervalued and abused by the system.
Jeremy Hunt wants to unilaterally impose a contract which will further stretch tired and overworked junior doctors in a time of austerity.
If Jeremy Hunt had come to us and said: 'Your elderly patients don't all get seen in the weekend and we want to change that', that's a serious rational concern that we could have addressed.
But he's using rubbish statistics to push his own political agenda.
I think stretching what is currently a five-day cover without any more doctors or support services would reduce continuity of care and efficiency.
He said Hunt was using "intellectually immoral" arguments to suggest there was not a seven-day NHS, and calling for the same services on weekends as weekdays without providing the infrastructure. 
As Sykes handed a passerby a leaflet he said: "Sorry we're not at work today."

Handing out stickers to passersby outside St George's hospital in the bitter cold, Miranda Lewis a GP trainee who has been at the hospital for 18 months said: 
I think it's really sad that it's come to this but unfortunately we have to take this extreme action after negotiations broke down. It's all about patient safety. And for juniors coming through we have to protect the NHS. 
Today my ward has four consultants. So more doctors with experience so I have no doubt patients will be looked after. We're sorry patients have had routine checks and operations rescheduled. 
Most of these people coming in are staff. Some came in before 8am to do checks. We're feeling slightly undervalued and work above and beyond the care of duty. The smear campaign by government and in the media makes us feel so undervalued. 
As staff passed around cups of coffee to keep doctors warm, James Barr, cardiothoracic registrar, told the Guardian: 
The infrastructure is not there, the beds are not there. We run a seven day service. I think the issue is in our service we struggle to run a five day service.
We run electives Monday to Friday. The idea of rolling out elective and clinical every day, it will be difficult and affect training of staff. And there will be less continuity of care. The research isn't there.
At the moment it is being run on a shoestring. Compared to France and Germany the proportion of GDP spent on healthcare much lower.
Also it will be hard to attract students when will leave with a huge student debt of £80k and starting salary of £22k.

This contract change is just one stand of the Government's attack on our NHS. Student nurses have had their grants snatched away - and costly NHS marketisation is continuing. Now junior doctors are making a stand against the bully boys in the Cabinet.

Prianka Padmanathan, 26, had tears in her eyes as she explained why she was on the picket line outside Bristol royal infirmary rather than at work.
It feels horrible but I don't think we have any choice. The new contract doesn't have in place the safeguards to stop us working dangerous and excessive hours. I feel that it's unsafe for the patients.
The government is selling it as creating a seven-day NHS. The problem is they are not prepared to provide any extra resources - no extra doctors or nurses, porters or anyone else. I don't think it's possible to improve services this way.
Padmanathan is a foundation year-two doctor undertaking research at Bristol University and working in the medical admissions unit at the BRI. She said most of her contemporaries would not be working in the UK in the next few years but heading abroad.
There's already a huge recruitment crisis among doctors. Under this new contract it will become almost impossible. Out of my year group there's about 40 of us. I know about five who have applied for a job in the UK. The majority are planning on travelling abroad. They are so worried about the situation. Hopefully we may persuade some of them to come back. I know the majority out in New Zealand and Australia won't come back.
Sarah Ibitoye, 29, an acute medicine registrar at the BRI, said: 
We feel we've come to the end of the road. Even though it's not what we want to do, we feel we have no other choice. It doesn't feel very nice being on strike. It's the first time I've ever done anything like this. Like all my colleagues I do this job because I love it. I like trying to help people; the idea of being out here not doing my usual job is not a nice feeling.
At the moment the hours I work are tough but they are OK. There are already shortages. I work in the respiratory department. That has taken its toll. We do often stay after our rota hours to get the work done. My fear is that if a lot of people who are threatening to leave the country do so, next year will be even worse. There will be far more shortages, the chances of staying late will increase. At least now we know if we stay late those hours are monitored. The trust investigates why we go over our monitored hours and try to make changes. If that monitoring is gone, the ability to recognise a problem and make a change will be gone. That is frightening really. I know when I'm tired I'm not as effective in my job. I don't want to put myself in that position where I feel I'm doing extra hours all the time and it changes the way I work.
Luke Carter, 27, a core medical trainee, said: 
I'm against the government's ideological push towards privatisation. If they get this contract for junior doctors through, the consultants will be next. If there's a new consultant contract, that will be the end of the NHS as we know it. We're lucky as doctors - we have a voice, we can fend for ourselves. But there's a lot of people in society who don't have that voice - who are being trampled on by the government. We do a difficult job. We get paid well. But I think the government should be honest if it wants us to work longer hours. If that's what they want, they should say that.

Holding leaflets that read "we are one profession we stand together" and dressed in his scrubs, Beamish said: 
I'm here because I believe so strongly what the Department of Health, Jeremy Hunt and the government is doing is so detrimental to patient care and the NHS as an institution and also as a sideline to us and working patterns.
It will be so damaging to those things that not causing a minor disruption today would be immoral and letting things go the way they are.
After a few years in surgery, and I know from many years of experience, sometimes an operation can kill someone. You need to make decisions knowing you're capable and not exhausted working 13 hour shifts.
It's dangerous not just to my patients and the NHS, but to us. Driving home late after a shift and our concentration levels is compared [as dangerous as] to drink driving.

At St Thomas's hospital in central London the 20-odd junior doctors on the picket line have been joined by members of the Lambeth branch of the Keep Our NHS Public campaign group, several people from the National Gallery Former Strikers group and a few members of the PCS union.
The hospital's location, opposite the Palace of Westminster, means there are also a few journalists including Robert Peston, now of ITV, and his crew. The mood is upbeat as a few motorists crossing Westminster Bridge toot their support. One British Medical Association steward helps picketers - most of them in their scrubs with stethoscopes around their necks - forget the cold by handing round a box of croissants and Jaffa Cakes.
A delegation of senior Green party figures, including Caroline Lucas MP and leader Natalie Bennett, got a warm reception from junior doctors glad of some political support.
In his thick winter coat, gloves and BMA armband, Dr William Turner, a 31-year-old trainee anaesthetist, is one of the junior doctors on strike.
His main worry, he says, is that the proposed new contract will result in a 30% pay cut and remove safeguards that currently prevent juniors being forced by their hospital to work dangerously long hours. 
That will lead to doctors potentially working 80 to 90 hours a week. That will result in tired doctors on the wards and we know that tired doctors make mistakes, so ultimately it's putting patients' lives at risk.
Turner's normal working day involves learning his trade during operations of all sorts, from a hernia repair to a bowel resection, lasting between four and 10 hours.
The best kind of strike is one where you don't have to deliver [actually walk out]. We are all here today with a heavy heart. No junior doctor goes on strike lightly. It takes an awful lot to push junior doctors into the position where they are ready to stand on the picket line and not treat patients. But that's the position we are in because we have been pushed into it by the government.

Here's the health secretary being put on the spot by the BBC's Norman Smith this morning. He has refused to give interviews today and answered just two questions from Smith: he denied he was putting the NHS at risk and insisted there was enough money for the "seven-day service" he has been championing (although many doctors insist there is already a seven-day service).

The Royal College of Midwives (RCM) has expressed its support for today's industrial action. 
Jon Skewes, director of policy, employment relations and communications at the RCM, said: 
We stand shoulder to shoulder with our NHS colleagues on this issue, and the Royal College of Midwives offers its support to the junior doctors. Like midwives who took strike action over the past year I know that patient safety will be the number one priority for the junior doctors, and that steps will be taken to ensure that those who need care will receive it.
These hard working health professionals are facing attacks on their pay, including on payment for working unsocial hours. This is also an issue facing midwives and other health professionals in the NHS, who are facing being paid less for working in the evening, weekends and at night.

Sophie Herbert, a junior doctor at St George's hospital in Tooting, south London, said: 
I'm here because the government had failed to offer meaningful negotiations about a contract that is unsafe.
They are making the working conditions for doctors and nurses so difficult that there's an exodus of these highly trained individuals to other countries and careers. We're already contending with overwhelming staff shortages and we are already at breaking point, we can't do any more. That is why we're here.
We've been here since 8am and we'll be here until 12pm.
My colleagues are at Tooting Broadway and will be going locally along the Northern line to talk to members of the public. 
When asked about how she thinks the public perceives the strike action, Sophie said: 
I feel supported by the public generally and hope they understand the reasons why we are striking. It's the future of the NHS and it's sad that it's come to this.

The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, urged ministers to apologise for the failure to avert a strike. In a post on Facebook he wrote: 
No NHS worker takes lightly the decision to strike, but the blame must be laid at the door of this government for the way it has treated doctors and now seeks to smear them in the press. It is time for this government to apologise to junior doctors and negotiate a fair deal that gets our NHS working again.

Today's strike isn't just affecting acute hospital trusts. Mental health services are being disrupted too. 
Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health NHS Trust, in north-east London, expected three-quarters of its 65 junior doctors to be on strike today. "We are anticipating around 75% of the 65 juniors to take industrial action. A small number are choosing not to strike, including some vacant junior doctor posts which are filled by locus", it said in a statement. It has cancelled some routine community and outpatient clinics "to minimise patient inconvenience", though stresses that all essential services will be covered by appropriate staff. 
In addition, "services for children and adolescents, working age adults and older people are all affected in some way by the industrial action. Planned outpatient appointments and domiciliary visits have been postponed and rearranged where possible, and consultants and specialty doctors are stepping in to support the safe provision of the service", adds the trust, which treats 155,000 people a year at its more than 40 sites 
Dr Jonathan Bindman, its medical director, said: 
Thanks to the goodwill of our consultant colleagues we are able to cover a good number of the essential junior doctors' roles. Of course, services like emergency assessments will be unaffected, and we will endeavour to provide as comprehensive a service as possible in the circumstances. In addition, we are ensuring that essential inpatient services will be covered by consultants, so care for our most vulnerable patients will not be affected. 
It is a similar picture across the capital at the South London and the Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, the NHS's largest mental health trust: 
During the industrial action, the trust is planning to deliver a reduced service that will cover emergency services only (similar to Christmas Day cover). This will include emergency admissions, place of safety suites, and psychiatric liaison support in our partner trusts' accident and emergency departments through on-call arrangements. Across the trust, this may mean that some routine clinics and community services could be cancelled.
Whilst we will not be running a full service, consultants will be working with nursing staff and other health professionals to ensure that patient care is not compromised. The trust employs 225 junior doctors and we recognise the right of these staff to take part in industrial action following the recent BMA ballot", the trust said in a statement.

Dagan Lonsdale, 32, a specialist registrar in intensive care medicine, based at St George's hospital in south London, explained to the Guardian why he is striking and what he will be doing today:
Doctors do not have a mass media machine. We do not have the powers of spin at the disposal of the Department of Health. What we do have is years of training in the evaluation of evidence and communication with people. Today, I will use these skills in a new way.
I will be outside my local tube station taking part in a nationwide campaign called Meet the Doctors. I will offer, to anyone who wishes to listen, to explain all of the issues that have led us to this situation.
No spin, just facts. I will explain how the removal of safeguards on doctors' working hours will put patients at risk, how we already have a seven-day NHS, how I already work weekends and nights, and that the new contract will not change this. I will explain that doctors are working at the very limit of what is possible and that a move to stretch them further is dangerous.
I will say that we have tried to explain all of this to the government, that we tried negotiating and they did not listen, that 20,000 of us marched in the streets of London and they did not listen, that 98% of us voted for the strike because this contract is so unsafe and unfair, and still  they will not listen. I will explain we are left with no choice but to take industrial action.

Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, the NHS medical director, has told hospitals to order doctors back to work if services become dangerously overstretched. In a letter to the directors of NHS, published by the Telegraph, he said doctors should be told to return if there is an  "exceptional and sustained deterioration in performance".
The BMA said Keogh was meddling with their right to strike.
Sir Robert Francis QC, who led the inquiry into the Mid Staffordshire scandal and a non-executive director of the Care Quality Commission, said industrial action would only "compromise patient safety".
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme he said: 
The only way that matters can be solved for doctors and patients is for talks to continue and for emergency care not to be withdrawn.

While Labour and the Liberal Democrats are sympathetic towards the junior doctors, they are not 100% behind them. Two parties have no such equivocation, though. They are the Green Party and, unsurprisingly, the National Health Action Party (NHAP), the small party dedicated to saving the NHS which fielded some candidates at last May's general election. 
Caroline Lucas, the Greens' only MP, and other leading party figures will show their support for the striking doctors today by joining the picket line at St Thomas's hospital in central London, directly opposite the Palace of Westminster on the other side of the Thames. 
The Brighton Pavilion MP sees today's strike as "healthcare professionals standing up to the bully boys around the Cabinet table. We fully support the action being taken by junior doctors today. This strike is happening because the government is failing to address very serious concerns around safe working conditions, while failing to offer proper recognition for those working unsocial hours," she said. Lucas added: 
Ministers have treated junior doctors with contempt and subjected them to a campaign of misinformation. It's no wonder they're at the end of their tether. This contract change is part of a wider government assault on our health service. 
She will be joined outside St Thomas's by Natalie Bennett, the Green Party leader; Baroness Jenny Jones, a London Assembly member and Sian Berry, the party's candidate to become Mayor of London. 
NHAP co-leader Dr Clive Peedell, an NHS oncologist, says the strike is "a referendum on the government's stewardship of the NHS". 
In his view: 
Junior doctors have been left with no choice but to take industrial action. The government has not compromised on its agenda to force junior doctors into working more hours for less pay, so that it can drive through its 'enhanced seven-day services' manifesto pledge which makes no sense in the context of a £22bn NHS efficiency savings program.
Peedell, who will be on the picket line outside University College London Hospital today, added: 
Despite the rhetoric from the Department of Health and NHS Employers, this remains an unfair and unsafe contract. Any potential inconvenience caused to patients by industrial action will be minor in comparison to the catastrophic long term risks to patient care resulting from an exodus of NHS juniors doctors if this contract is imposed. 
block-time published-time 7.39am GMT 
At 8am, today junior doctors begin the first in a series of three strikes over planned changes to their contract - the first walkout by junior doctors in 40 years. The dispute between the British Medical Association, which represents 38,000 of the 45,000 junior doctors in England, and the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has become increasingly embittered and this time, unlike when a previous walkout planned for 1 December, there has been no last minute reprieve. 
On Monday, NHS England said that 1,425 inpatient operations and procedures had been cancelled as a result of the strike alongside 2,535 outpatient ones. It said that 3,400 of the cancellations were today and 654 - 192 inpatients and 462 day cases - are in London. 
The postponed operations amount to about 13% of the normal daily total of 30,000. 
Across Greater Manchester, more than half (54%) of planned surgery and "non-urgent day-cases" have been cancelled. Approximately 11% out-patient appointments have also been cancelled.
Emergency care is excluded from today's industrial action but is likely to be affected nevertheless with NHS England saying hospitals would generally be under additional pressure.
There are believed to be around 100 pickets, at least, planned outside hospitals.
We will be providing live updates from picket lines and on how the NHS is coping at a time when increased winter demand has already put a strain on services.

Since the dispute began in mid-September there has been a lot of confusion about who exactly counts as a "junior doctor". Quite a few people have assumed that the term refers to only young trainee doctors, fresh out of medical school, or those in the very early stages of training after graduation that -- after about 15 years -- usually results in doctors at last becoming senior doctors, ie consultants. 
Some newspapers certainly gave that impression, at least early on in this now long-running contract row. It's an easy mistake to make, especially when so many of the junior doctors who have given interviews to broadcast media have looked to be in their early 20s. However, actually far, far more doctors than that are classed, arguably unhelpfully, as "junior" doctors. 
So, to (try and) be clear: in the NHS, a "junior" doctor is any level or grade of doctor below a consultant. So any medic who is a Foundation Year 1 or 2 doctor, or house officer or senior house officer, or registrar or senior registrar -- the last stop before consultant status -- is a "junior" doctor, even if s/he is in their mid or even late 30s. Or, sometimes, in their 40s. 
There are about 45,000 of them in the NHS in England, of whom 38,000 belong to the BMA, and it was 98% of them that voted in November to strike in protest at the proposed new contract. 
It's easy for anyone not in the NHS or au fait with how medicine works to assume that "junior" doctors are all fairly young. To add to that confusion, all junior doctors are -- technically at least -- trainee doctors until they become a consultant, even if they are highly skilled and potentially in charge of busy wards full of medically needy patients, for example, as quite a few often are. A few readers have taken issue with me for referring in stories to junior doctors being "trainee doctors", which was my way of avoiding undue and potentially tedious repetition of the phrase "junior doctors". In my view medicine's crude distinction between junior and senior (consultant) doctors, shored up by a series of acronyms that denote (to insiders) how far a particular junior doctor has reached in their training, is outmoded, open to (clearly) misinterpretation and also patronising and wildly hierarchical. Surely someone can come up with a better way of telling the world how experienced (or not) a doctor is? 
But technically I am right to refer to them as all being trainees, though I recognise how imperfect that is. The phrase I've used in many of my stories about the dispute over recent months, to try and convey the range of doctors covered by the term junior doctor, is "all doctors below the level of consultant". That's who they are, all 45,000 of them.

Striking junior doctors outside St George's hospital in Tooting, south-west London, have a smiling poo depicting health secretary Jeremy Hunt. 
The green posters that the striking doctors, some wearing their scrubs, were holding read: "We are one profession. We stand together."
Some doctors said they had "never done anything like this" before. 
Unlike the previous strike by nurses at the hospital, there was little singing or chanting outside the gates. No megaphone. It was an austere strike by doctors, some who have worked in the profession for many years, yet who feel the health service is coming under severe pressure. 
Holding aloft a smiling poo emoji that was meant to be a visual representation of Jeremy Hunt, Emily, a junior doctor, with a stethoscope around her neck, said: 
We get a lot of rubbish thrown at us.
We're intelligent people and now is the time to stand together. We believe we deserve to be treated better and support our colleagues as well.
Some colleagues wished them good luck, others brought out cups of tea for the striking doctors of the hospital, which has around 1000 hospital beds and is known for providing regional and national specialist care in cardiac, neurosurgery and cancer services areas..

Justin Madders, a member of Labour's shadow health team, writes in the New Statesman today:
Speak to any junior doctor and they'll tell you the last thing they want to be doing is withdrawing their labour, but the truth is they feel like Jeremy Hunt has backed them into a corner and left them with no other way to get their message across.
 There remains significant concerns with the proposed new contract that the Government is trying to impose on junior doctors - not least the impact on patient safety as a result of junior doctors being forced to work excessively long hours - but today's industrial action has become about so much more.
 Junior doctors tell me they feel like they are the first line of defence for the future of the NHS. They feel like if they don't stand up to the government now, then next it'll be the nurses, the midwives and the healthcare assistants. Whether that assessment is right or wrong, it is a remarkable situation for junior doctors to find themselves in. Trust has been damaged, let us hope it is not irreversible.

With a stethoscope around his neck, Richard Sykes, a senior house officer in elderly care at St George's hospital, said Jeremy Hunt had approached the negotiations "with a sledgehammer". 
The reason that we're striking is we feel the government is trying to impose an unsafe contract on junior doctors which massively squeezes [the NHS] and doctors who feel undervalued and abused by the system.
Jeremy Hunt wants to unilaterally impose a contract which will further stretch tired and overworked junior doctors in a time of austerity.
If Jeremy Hunt had come to us and said: 'Your elderly patients don't all get seen in the weekend and we want to change that', that's a serious rational concern that we could have addressed.
But he's using rubbish statistics to push his own political agenda.
I think stretching what is currently a five-day cover without any more doctors or support services would reduce continuity of care and efficiency.
He said Hunt was using "intellectually immoral" arguments to suggest there was not a seven-day NHS, and calling for the same services on weekends as weekdays without providing the infrastructure. 
As Sykes handed a passerby a leaflet he said: "Sorry we're not at work today."

Handing out stickers to passersby outside St George's hospital in the bitter cold, Miranda Lewis a GP trainee who has been at the hospital for 18 months said: 
I think it's really sad that it's come to this but unfortunately we have to take this extreme action after negotiations broke down. It's all about patient safety. And for juniors coming through we have to protect the NHS. 
Today my ward has four consultants. So more doctors with experience so I have no doubt patients will be looked after. We're sorry patients have had routine checks and operations rescheduled. 
Most of these people coming in are staff. Some came in before 8am to do checks. We're feeling slightly undervalued and work above and beyond the care of duty. The smear campaign by government and in the media makes us feel so undervalued. 
As staff passed around cups of coffee to keep doctors warm, James Barr, cardiothoracic registrar, told the Guardian: 
The infrastructure is not there, the beds are not there. We run a seven day service. I think the issue is in our service we struggle to run a five day service.
We run electives Monday to Friday. The idea of rolling out elective and clinical every day, it will be difficult and affect training of staff. And there will be less continuity of care. The research isn't there.
At the moment it is being run on a shoestring. Compared to France and Germany the proportion of GDP spent on healthcare much lower.
Also it will be hard to attract students when will leave with a huge student debt of £80k and starting salary of £22k.

Prianka Padmanathan, 26, had tears in her eyes as she explained why she was on the picket line outside Bristol royal infirmary rather than at work.
It feels horrible but I don't think we have any choice. The new contract doesn't have in place the safeguards to stop us working dangerous and excessive hours. I feel that it's unsafe for the patients.
The government is selling it as creating a seven-day NHS. The problem is they are not prepared to provide any extra resources - no extra doctors or nurses, porters or anyone else. I don't think it's possible to improve services this way.
Padmanathan is a foundation year-two doctor undertaking research at Bristol University and working in the medical admissions unit at the BRI. She said most of her contemporaries would not be working in the UK in the next few years but heading abroad.
There's already a huge recruitment crisis among doctors. Under this new contract it will become almost impossible. Out of my year group there's about 40 of us. I know about five who have applied for a job in the UK. The majority are planning on travelling abroad. They are so worried about the situation. Hopefully we may persuade some of them to come back. I know the majority out in New Zealand and Australia won't come back.
Sarah Ibitoye, 29, an acute medicine registrar at the BRI, said: 
We feel we've come to the end of the road. Even though it's not what we want to do, we feel we have no other choice. It doesn't feel very nice being on strike. It's the first time I've ever done anything like this. Like all my colleagues I do this job because I love it. I like trying to help people; the idea of being out here not doing my usual job is not a nice feeling.
At the moment the hours I work are tough but they are OK. There are already shortages. I work in the respiratory department. That has taken its toll. We do often stay after our rota hours to get the work done. My fear is that if a lot of people who are threatening to leave the country do so, next year will be even worse. There will be far more shortages, the chances of staying late will increase. At least now we know if we stay late those hours are monitored. The trust investigates why we go over our monitored hours and try to make changes. If that monitoring is gone, the ability to recognise a problem and make a change will be gone. That is frightening really. I know when I'm tired I'm not as effective in my job. I don't want to put myself in that position where I feel I'm doing extra hours all the time and it changes the way I work.
Luke Carter, 27, a core medical trainee, said: 
I'm against the government's ideological push towards privatisation. If they get this contract for junior doctors through, the consultants will be next. If there's a new consultant contract, that will be the end of the NHS as we know it. We're lucky as doctors - we have a voice, we can fend for ourselves. But there's a lot of people in society who don't have that voice - who are being trampled on by the government. We do a difficult job. We get paid well. But I think the government should be honest if it wants us to work longer hours. If that's what they want, they should say that.
Elsewhere in the city there were pickets outside Bristol's famous children's hospital, the maternity unit St Michael's and the eye hospital.
Lin Clark, a retired public services worker, arrived with (slightly burnt) mince pies. "I was in hospital with my mother recently and I see how hard the junior doctors work," she said. "I'm 100% behind them. This new contract is all about the government privatising the NHS."

Raymond Tallis, the former professor of geriatric medicine at the University of Manchester and a consultant physician, said he had been "radicalised by the brutal assault on the NHS" by the Tories. 
"I've not marched since I was a student but I was radicalised as a result of Andrew Lansley's Health & Social Care Act - it's a direct assault on the principles of the NHS," he said on the picket line with junior doctors from Stepping Hill hospital in Stockport. 
He added: 
The greatest threat to patient safety is cuts in funding, putting things out to market. The private sectors picks things up and puts them down. The Tories' plans are a frontal assault on the values of the NHS - it's a war of values against prices.

 Midlands hospital orders striking doctors in  
Sandwell hospital in the West Midlands says it has ordered some of its junior doctors to come to work because of high demand.
Dr Roger Stedman, medical director at Sandwell and West Birmingham hospitals NHS trust, said: 
Over the last two days we have had very high numbers of patients come to hospital, and fewer than usual discharged. 
Because of that we decided to require trainee doctors allocated to ward work to attend Sandwell during today's strike. Staff taking action at City are unaffected. We would like to thank local doctors' representatives for their constructive support and advice.

Andy Beamish, surgical registrar based in Sweden is back in the UK to support strike action. He splits his time at the royal college of surgeons and a hospital in Gothenburg. 
Holding leaflets that read "we are one profession we stand together" and dressed in his scrubs, Beamish said: 
I'm here because I believe so strongly what the Department of Health, Jeremy Hunt and the government is doing is so detrimental to patient care and the NHS as an institution and also as a sideline to us and working patterns.
It will be so damaging to those things that not causing a minor disruption today would be immoral and letting things go the way they are.
After a few years in surgery, and I know from many years of experience, sometimes an operation can kill someone. You need to make decisions knowing you're capable and not exhausted working 13 hour shifts.
It's dangerous not just to my patients and the NHS, but to us. Driving home late after a shift and our concentration levels is compared [as dangerous as] to drink driving.

At St Thomas's hospital in central London the 20-odd junior doctors on the picket line have been joined by members of the Lambeth branch of the Keep Our NHS Public campaign group, several people from the National Gallery Former Strikers group and a few members of the PCS union.
The hospital's location, opposite the Palace of Westminster, means there are also a few journalists including Robert Peston, now of ITV, and his crew. The mood is upbeat as a few motorists crossing Westminster Bridge toot their support. One British Medical Association steward helps picketers - most of them in their scrubs with stethoscopes around their necks - forget the cold by handing round a box of croissants and Jaffa Cakes.
A delegation of senior Green party figures, including Caroline Lucas MP and leader Natalie Bennett, got a warm reception from junior doctors glad of some political support.
In his thick winter coat, gloves and BMA armband, Dr William Turner, a 31-year-old trainee anaesthetist, is one of the junior doctors on strike.
His main worry, he says, is that the proposed new contract will result in a 30% pay cut and remove safeguards that currently prevent juniors being forced by their hospital to work dangerously long hours. 
That will lead to doctors potentially working 80 to 90 hours a week. That will result in tired doctors on the wards and we know that tired doctors make mistakes, so ultimately it's putting patients' lives at risk.
Turner's normal working day involves learning his trade during operations of all sorts, from a hernia repair to a bowel resection, lasting between four and 10 hours.
The best kind of strike is one where you don't have to deliver [actually walk out]. We are all here today with a heavy heart. No junior doctor goes on strike lightly. It takes an awful lot to push junior doctors into the position where they are ready to stand on the picket line and not treat patients. But that's the position we are in because we have been pushed into it by the government.

The Royal College of Midwives (RCM) has expressed its support for today's industrial action. 
Jon Skewes, director of policy, employment relations and communications at the RCM, said: 
We stand shoulder to shoulder with our NHS colleagues on this issue, and the Royal College of Midwives offers its support to the junior doctors. Like midwives who took strike action over the past year I know that patient safety will be the number one priority for the junior doctors, and that steps will be taken to ensure that those who need care will receive it.
These hard working health professionals are facing attacks on their pay, including on payment for working unsocial hours. This is also an issue facing midwives and other health professionals in the NHS, who are facing being paid less for working in the evening, weekends and at night.

Sophie Herbert, a junior doctor at St George's hospital in Tooting, south London, said: 
I'm here because the government had failed to offer meaningful negotiations about a contract that is unsafe.
They are making the working conditions for doctors and nurses so difficult that there's an exodus of these highly trained individuals to other countries and careers. We're already contending with overwhelming staff shortages and we are already at breaking point, we can't do any more. That is why we're here.
We've been here since 8am and we'll be here until 12pm.

Today's strike isn't just affecting acute hospital trusts. Mental health services are being disrupted too. 
Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health NHS Trust, in north-east London, expected three-quarters of its 65 junior doctors to be on strike today. "We are anticipating around 75% of the 65 juniors to take industrial action. A small number are choosing not to strike, including some vacant junior doctor posts which are filled by locus", it said in a statement. It has cancelled some routine community and outpatient clinics "to minimise patient inconvenience", though stresses that all essential services will be covered by appropriate staff. 
In addition, "services for children and adolescents, working age adults and older people are all affected in some way by the industrial action. Planned outpatient appointments and domiciliary visits have been postponed and rearranged where possible, and consultants and specialty doctors are stepping in to support the safe provision of the service", adds the trust, which treats 155,000 people a year at its more than 40 sites 
Dr Jonathan Bindman, its medical director, said: 
Thanks to the goodwill of our consultant colleagues we are able to cover a good number of the essential junior doctors' roles. Of course, services like emergency assessments will be unaffected, and we will endeavour to provide as comprehensive a service as possible in the circumstances. In addition, we are ensuring that essential inpatient services will be covered by consultants, so care for our most vulnerable patients will not be affected. 
It is a similar picture across the capital at the South London and the Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, the NHS's largest mental health trust: 
During the industrial action, the trust is planning to deliver a reduced service that will cover emergency services only (similar to Christmas Day cover). This will include emergency admissions, place of safety suites, and psychiatric liaison support in our partner trusts' accident and emergency departments through on-call arrangements. Across the trust, this may mean that some routine clinics and community services could be cancelled.
Whilst we will not be running a full service, consultants will be working with nursing staff and other health professionals to ensure that patient care is not compromised. The trust employs 225 junior doctors and we recognise the right of these staff to take part in industrial action following the recent BMA ballot", the trust said in a statement.

Dagan Lonsdale, 32, a specialist registrar in intensive care medicine, based at St George's hospital in south London, explained to the Guardian why he is striking and what he will be doing today:
Doctors do not have a mass media machine. We do not have the powers of spin at the disposal of the Department of Health. What we do have is years of training in the evaluation of evidence and communication with people. Today, I will use these skills in a new way.
I will be outside my local tube station taking part in a nationwide campaign called Meet the Doctors. I will offer, to anyone who wishes to listen, to explain all of the issues that have led us to this situation.
No spin, just facts. I will explain how the removal of safeguards on doctors' working hours will put patients at risk, how we already have a seven-day NHS, how I already work weekends and nights, and that the new contract will not change this. I will explain that doctors are working at the very limit of what is possible and that a move to stretch them further is dangerous.
I will say that we have tried to explain all of this to the government, that we tried negotiating and they did not listen, that 20,000 of us marched in the streets of London and they did not listen, that 98% of us voted for the strike because this contract is so unsafe and unfair, and still  they will not listen. I will explain we are left with no choice but to take industrial action.

Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, the NHS medical director, has told hospitals to order doctors back to work if services become dangerously overstretched. In a letter to the directors of NHS, published by the Telegraph, he said doctors should be told to return if there is an  "exceptional and sustained deterioration in performance".
The BMA said Keogh was meddling with their right to strike.
Sir Robert Francis QC, who led the inquiry into the Mid Staffordshire scandal and a non-executive director of the Care Quality Commission, said industrial action would only "compromise patient safety".
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme he said: 
The only way that matters can be solved for doctors and patients is for talks to continue and for emergency care not to be withdrawn.

While Labour and the Liberal Democrats are sympathetic towards the junior doctors, they are not 100% behind them. Two parties have no such equivocation, though. They are the Green Party and, unsurprisingly, the National Health Action Party (NHAP), the small party dedicated to saving the NHS which fielded some candidates at last May's general election. 
Caroline Lucas, the Greens' only MP, and other leading party figures will show their support for the striking doctors today by joining the picket line at St Thomas's hospital in central London, directly opposite the Palace of Westminster on the other side of the Thames. 
The Brighton Pavilion MP sees today's strike as "healthcare professionals standing up to the bully boys around the Cabinet table. We fully support the action being taken by junior doctors today. This strike is happening because the government is failing to address very serious concerns around safe working conditions, while failing to offer proper recognition for those working unsocial hours," she said. Lucas added: 
Ministers have treated junior doctors with contempt and subjected them to a campaign of misinformation. It's no wonder they're at the end of their tether. This contract change is part of a wider government assault on our health service. 
She will be joined outside St Thomas's by Natalie Bennett, the Green Party leader; Baroness Jenny Jones, a London Assembly member and Sian Berry, the party's candidate to become Mayor of London. 
NHAP co-leader Dr Clive Peedell, an NHS oncologist, says the strike is "a referendum on the government's stewardship of the NHS". 
In his view: 
Junior doctors have been left with no choice but to take industrial action. The government has not compromised on its agenda to force junior doctors into working more hours for less pay, so that it can drive through its 'enhanced seven-day services' manifesto pledge which makes no sense in the context of a £22bn NHS efficiency savings program.
Peedell, who will be on the picket line outside University College London Hospital today, added: 
Despite the rhetoric from the Department of Health and NHS Employers, this remains an unfair and unsafe contract. Any potential inconvenience caused to patients by industrial action will be minor in comparison to the catastrophic long term risks to patient care resulting from an exodus of NHS juniors doctors if this contract is imposed. 
block-time published-time 7.39am GMT 
At 8am, today junior doctors begin the first in a series of three strikes over planned changes to their contract - the first walkout by junior doctors in 40 years. The dispute between the British Medical Association, which represents 38,000 of the 45,000 junior doctors in England, and the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has become increasingly embittered and this time, unlike when a previous walkout planned for 1 December, there has been no last minute reprieve. 
On Monday, NHS England said that 1,425 inpatient operations and procedures had been cancelled as a result of the strike alongside 2,535 outpatient ones. It said that 3,400 of the cancellations were today and 654 - 192 inpatients and 462 day cases - are in London. 
The postponed operations amount to about 13% of the normal daily total of 30,000. 
Across Greater Manchester, more than half (54%) of planned surgery and "non-urgent day-cases" have been cancelled. Approximately 11% out-patient appointments have also been cancelled.
Emergency care is excluded from today's industrial action but is likely to be affected nevertheless with NHS England saying hospitals would generally be under additional pressure.
There are believed to be around 100 pickets, at least, planned outside hospitals.
We will be providing live updates from picket lines and on how the NHS is coping at a time when increased winter demand has already put a strain on services.

Milos Raonic lays down his Australian Open credentials; 
IAAF bans more officials; Messi wins record fifth Ballon d'Or; Tributes to Christy O'Connor Jr.

Graham Snowdon.

With next week's Australian Open on the horizon, the great and good of tennis were busy limbering up for the season's first grand slam. It was Groundhog Day all over at the Brisbane International except in one crucial respect, as Milos Raonic beat Roger Federer 6-4, 6-4 to avenge his defeat in last year's final. The Canadian then used his victory speech to mount an unexpected plea for world peace: "I hope in 2016 we learn to love each other a little bit more and the world becomes a safer place," he said. Sadly the call fell on deaf ears at the Qatar Open, where merciless tennis automaton Novak Djokovic claimed his 60th ATP title by crushing Rafael Nadal 6-1, 6-2. 

IAAF bans more top figures
Another harrowing week for athletics saw three senior figures permanently kicked out of the sport after a lengthy independent investigation into corruption, blackmail and extortion. Papa Massata Diack, a former IAAF marketing consultant and son of the disgraced former IAAF president Lamine Diack, was banned for life along with former Russia athletic federation head and IAAF treasurer Valentin Balakhnichev. A senior Russian coach, Alexei Melnikov, also received a life ban, while Gabriel DollÈ, the IAAF's former anti-doping chief, was suspended for five years. IAAF president Sebastian Coe said the bans "could not send a stronger message", but he remains under intense pressure with the scandal showing little sign of abating.

Messi's Ballon d'Or record
Barcelona's Lionel Messi underlined his status as the greatest footballer of the modern era, winning the game's biggest individual accolade, the Ballon d'Or, for a record fifth time, ahead of his great Real Madrid rival Cristiano Ronaldo. "I want to thank football in general for everything it has brought me, both the bad and the good, because it has made me grow and learn," Messi said. In England, the FA Cup third round - when the game's aristocrats join the fray - saw League Two Oxford United knock out Premier League Swansea. Fellow League Two sides Exeter City and Wycombe Wanderers held Premier League Liverpool and Aston Villa to home draws, earning lucrative replays, while non-League Eastleigh Town drew with Bolton on a midwinter bog of a pitch to delight football nostalgists everywhere.

Tributes to O'Connor Jr
Golf paid its respects to Christy O'Connor Jr, one of Ireland's best-known players, who died last week aged 67. O'Connor Jr was perhaps best known for his crucial contribution to Europe's retention of the 1989 Ryder Cup at The Belfry. "We've lost a true Irishman, character and golfer," reflected Europe's most recent Ryder Cup captain, Paul McGinley.

Guardian Weekly Letters, 15 January 2016; 
Fake and real conspiracies; climate deal illusion; what Greeks really fear

Conspiracies: fake and real
I take issue with Natalie NougayrËde's article (1 January) that references conspiracy theories of hard left and right political parties, claiming they undermine democracy. Just because wild conspiracy theories abound does not mean there are no actual conspiracies. It is fairly well established now that Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction were pure fabrication by George Bush and Tony Blair. Why? To create a useful scapegoat? To gain control of oil supplies? To further the fortunes of the military-industrial complex? To further establish the US as global hegemon? Or some vague combination of the above?
It is also fairly well established that as banks and corporations have grown in size they have grown in influence over our governments, who act more in their favour and less on behalf of the people. Hence governments water down climate agreements and give corporations the right to sue governments, who seek to protect the environment, for loss of anticipated profits. In both of these cases it is the conspiracies themselves that undermine democracy, not theories.
I have little time for theories that cast me in the role of helpless victim of shadowy cabals. I can't stretch to believing that jet planes are spraying chemicals everywhere. Yet it is clear to me that things are not what they seem. The spin is ubiquitous. 
After a lifetime of following events, I still have only a hazy understanding of what is happening. If NougayrËde thinks things are self-evident, how can I ever trust her perspective? Edward ButterworthVictoria, British Columbia, Canada
∑ I was surprised to read, in Natalie NougayrËde's piece, the names of Podemos and Syriza among other groups or regimes that thrive on conspiracy theories threatening democracy.
First, is it sensible to brand them with the far-left label? Certainly if we regard Tony Blair's Labour or FranÁois Hollande's socialism as leftwing, but we are far from Pol Pot's Cambodia or Stalin's USSR.
And let's look again at their "anti-elite message". Accusing an oligarchical banking system of southern Europe's woes, is it necessarily leaning towards conspiracy theories? For instance, Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, [and others] had some responsibility in the 2008 financial crisis, and reportedly manipulated Greece's accounting when that country entered the EU. A former high-profile Goldman Sachs employee, Mario Draghi, was appointed president of the European Central Bank. And a former Goldman Sachs adviser, Mario Monti, became Italy's prime minister.
There have also been other continuous banking scandals, like the Libor and forex manipulations.
How do we know of those episodes? By browsing obscure websites? No, by reading the Guardian. Marc JachymLes Ulis, France

Do we really want to change?
I read Fiona Harvey's report on the Paris climate deal (18 December) and really wanted to share in the sense of euphoria that is palpable in the article. Indeed, after the catastrophe of Copenhagen everyone wanted this one to go through and yes, it did go through.
But when I re-read the article, the phrase that kept popping out was "not legally binding". So I really do wonder whether the goal was to tackle climate change or rather to "fudge it" just enough for the leaders who attended to save face.
One key point is that carbon-intensive infrastructure built today will be operating for years.
So surely monitoring this would be the best way to measure the success of the talks? If we take this as true, then Paris has already failed, because such projects are coming thick and fast.
Up until recently here in Cologne, winter temperatures have consistently been in the teens. In Britain there has been extensive flooding and around the world there are ever-more extreme weather events. Climate change is accelerating and the aspirations of those in Paris, with their generous time-frames, are probably nothing more than wishful thinking.
Somehow the agreement in Paris has absolved us and calmed our fears. That's nice, but I would rather have a solution than absolution. Alan MitchamCologne, Germany
∑ It surely was, as Fiona Harvey puts it, a "deal won by marathon skilful diplomacy". The deal essentially maintains the status quo without the payoffs that some regions of the world demanded, while paying lip service to the fiction of man's effect on solar global warming.
It was a masterpiece. Our politicians scored again. Now let's get on with living in a productive society without green distraction. John GrahamHoogstraten, Belgium
∑ I read Sandra Laville's Kingston Diary (1 January) with outrage. A $600m highway to cut the travel time from the capital to a resort in Jamaica from two hours to one? No wonder China was so resistant at the Paris conference. I am one, among millions, who has solar panels, composts my waste, has an organic garden, darns my cotton socks and uses my car as little as possible. Then I read about the Beijing highway.
How much carbon will be released in building this road, driving on it twice as fast, flying in and servicing all the people coming to all the collateral resorts? Governments are so quick to uptake tourism projects, when $600m could have made the world of difference for ordinary Jamaicans if it were spent on renewable energy and education.
To quote one of Jamaica's most famous sons, Bob Marley: Don't gain the world and lose your soul / Wisdom is better than silver or gold. Gaynor McGrathArmidale, New South Wales, Australia

Psychologists also at risk
The optimism expressed on the prospects of employment in a future robotic age (1 January) is fine if one is trying to sugar-coat the bitter pill, but it does not deal with reality.
Future jobs may emerge from a merger of human and artificial intelligence (AI) and those humans with superior intelligence may so survive. But what of those who do not have skills of a special nature?
As an example, in the paper by Martin Ford cited in the article, psychologists are portrayed as a group unlikely to be seriously affected by the growth of AI, due to the assumption that soft skills of social sensitivity and empathy are essential elements of the job. Examination of what a psychologist actually does, however, reveals that automated testing and interpretation and electronic delivery of therapy will reduce the number of psychologists who will be employed. If such a profession is not immune, what picture emerges for jobs without a need for extensive social intelligence? J Mike InnesWoolloomooloo, NSW, Australia

What Greeks fear most
Most Greeks with children have the same fears as the Syrians fleeing Syria: having to wait years for things to change destroys their kids' future (1 January).
Already Greeks abroad are sponsoring the emigration of relatives in Greece with children. The problem is not that Syriza has yet to start vigorously pursuing the tax-dodging rich upper classes, as Euclid Tsakalotas says.
Ask any Greek what fundamentally ails the country, and the first angry peeve is against the public system - to dimosio. All Greeks have horror stories dealing with the intimidating behaviour of public servants. What they want is for Syriza to replace those public employees who bribe, blackmail, hire relatives, evade paying taxes, refuse to give receipts, refuse to accept bank cheques, delay processing forms out of pique, loot public land to build their villas and bend laws to their advantage. They blight the life of those who do not have the necessary connections that the upper classes, and those who work in state services, enjoy.
This rancid public system needs a major cleanup. So far nothing has been done. If the left in general does not get its act together to accomplish this task first, those who voted for Syriza will be the losers. Merlie PapadopoulosMontreal, Canada

Australia v India: the first one day international - as it happened; 
Australia win by five wickets at the Waca Ground in PerthCenturies by Smith and Bailey see hosts take 1-0 lead in five-match series.

Russell Jackson and Geoff Lemon.

block-time published-time 10.00pm AEST 
Well, what a run-fest at the WACA. That's something new and original, ha ha, ha, ha. I'm having nightmare visions of Ross Taylor batting for the rest of my life.
It was easy for the batsmen all day, as shown by the 200-run partnerships on each side. Kohli and Sharma were good, but maybe not quite fast enough. Bailey and Smith outpaced them and set the win up with ease, even though it went into the last over.
India had no control after the first few overs: the Aussies picked up singles at will, then added boundaries occasionally when they felt like it. There was no pressure whatsoever in the field.
Australia did have a bit of control thanks to Josh Hazlewood, who bowled excellently to return 1-41 from his 10 overs, while Scott Boland was tidy until the last couple of overs on debut. 
Smith and Sharma both pushed their ODI averages past 40 with big centuries. Handy.
Off we go to Brisbane, with hopefully a bit more in the deck for the bowlers to keep things interesting. Geoff Lemon signing off - we'll catch up with you there on Friday the 15th.

 Australia win by five wickets  
 49.2 overs, Australia 310-5 (Marsh 12, Faulkner 1) 
You'd think, with five balls to go, there would be some prayer of putting pressure on the Australians. But Sran bowled a wide down leg to level the scores, then Dhoni doesn't even bother to bring the field in.
Faulkner gets to score the winning runs in an ODI once again, in the easiest way he's ever done it, with a single to long-on. Thanks Mahendra.

That is a deeply committed piece of fielding from the debutant Sran in the deep to pointlessly save one run. Love it. Smith drove behind point and Sran had to belt all the way around from cover to slide and haul it in. Six from that over, the other three in singles. There have been singles everywhere today. Cue jokes about singles.

Sran has bowled well but now they're going hard at him. Smith doesn't like the send-off that Sran gave to Warner earlier, he's having a go at Sran every time he goes for runs. The batsmen take singles, then Marsh cuts three. Smith cuts four. More the square drive really, had to reach for it, an excellent and strange and rare and curious shot. The over goes for 13. 
Advantage, players not on debut. A bit over the top, perhaps.

Finally they break through. Bailey slams one straight down the ground from Ashwin, but Kumar is able to get across from long-off in time to intercept it. Big cheers for the former captain as he walks from the ground, the partnership was worth 242 and was Australia's best ever for the third wicket.

Jadeja back. Thank you, say the Australians.

Finally, Barinder Sran comes back. He took the first two wickets, should have had three, was the prime threat... and then he didn't bowl after the 11th over. Now he bowls the 40th with the game all but gone. One of those weird captaincy non-decisions that so frustrate people about MS Dhoni.
Smith doesn't mind, he crashes Sran wide of mid-on for four. The over goes for seven.

 CENTURY! Smith 100 (97 balls)  
 39th over: Australia 242-2 (Smith 108, Bailey 109) 
Smith matches Bailey with a ton, this from the first ball of the over with a single. It's his fifth century in ODI cricket, and he gives an understated crowd salute as he wipes his brow. All in a day's work. 
Bailey celebrates it by crashing a cut for four, then turns the strike over to Smith who decides that now is the time to clear the front leg and swing. One such shot goes straight down the ground to the fence, another goes off the edge past his stumps and away fine. 
14 from the over against one of India's better bowlers. This is unstoppable now.

 37th over: Australia 219-2 (Smith 91, Bailey 103) 
Yadav tests Smith a little, with a fast bouncer that evades the uppercut, then a fuller ball that Smith tries to slog but can only edge into his pad and away into the off-side. 
Unfortunately for Yadav, those were the last two balls of an over that had already been worked around for five runs. And they're not even too fussed about scoring against him, because they know there are overs from the spare bowlers that have to be bowled.

 CENTURY! Bailey 100 (106 balls)  
 36th over: Australia 213-2 (Smith 88, Bailey 101) 
That's the ton for Bailey! Thanks to Kumar, who fielded on the off-side from his own bowling as Bailey took a single, then threw at the stumps and conceded an overthrow. Bailey's third ODI hundred. That's a great result for one of the genuine good guys of cricket, and a batsman who is so quick to be questioned and so slow to be appreciated. He's kept things very calm after ball one today, and paced the innings perfectly.

 35th over: Australia 209-2 (Smith 87, Bailey 98) 
Yadav is doing what he can, but these two are so well set now. Bailey is closing on triple figures and doesn't want to do anything rash. He drives two runs straight, then flicks two to fine leg, then takes a single. The numbers keep ticking by.

Finally Dhoni gives up on the dairy spinners. The butter-makers. Deadly on home decks, diddly on this one. At least today. Bhuvi Kumar comes back for his gently paced swing bowling.

The gentlest of medium pace, sent down in a barely competent childlike flurry of arms and legs.

Bailey down the pitch first ball to drop-kick six runs over the sight screen. Smith goes back to the fifth ball as Ashwin drops short, and lashes four square of the wicket. Then as Ashwin bowls fuller Smith drops one into the straight crowd as well.

 15th over: Australia 73-2 (Smith 24, Bailey 30) 
Yadav has Bailey hopping a bit - literally, as the pace surprises Bailey and has his shovelling awkwardly towards mid-off. Bailey is using this strange batting stance, he's basically facing mid-off rather than the bowler, which means that his pads rather than his bat are facing the ball. You'd think it would be a risky proposition, especially given some of the troubles of Shane Watson with the front leg. But Bailey must have some rationale.
Phil Withall doesn't want a successful chase. "I will predict an Australian capitulation, mainly because I can but also because I like to listen to Channel Nine commentators attempt to hype their product as it sinks. It probably won't happen but you've got to have a dream."

Ouch. Another near run-out, and a painful one. Umesh Yadav comes on for some proper fast bowling. His short ball smashes Bailey on the hand, sandwiching his fingers. Bailey was busy with the pain, he actually jumped in the air after the ball had hit, and only then did he realise Smith was halfway down the pitch given the ball had skewed into the gully.
Bailey set off like a rabbit in gunfire, but he still would have been short if the throw had hit. He gets some treatment on the hand.

One wicket for 52 is a bit better than 2 wickets for 40. That's the difference between the Australian and Indian efforts after 10 overs.

It was a curious sort of innings - India are actually a bit below the score you might expect with so many wickets in hand. Neither Sharma nor Kohli could really launch beyond the run-a-ball rate for their innings, and that was reflected in the overall score.
Still, you'll win more games defending 300 than you'll lose. So let us see what the Golden Hats can do.

I think the Australians might be a bit slower starting myself, switching out of Test mode. They'd prefer to ease into this ODI series but they're going to have to come out swinging to match the asking rate across 50 overs.

 That innings in brief 
"It's not much fun," concedes Australian all-rounder James Faulkner of bowling to Rohit Sharma, whose 171 not out from 163 deliveries featured 13 fours and 7 sixes. "It's in our hands now to chase the total," he adds. Mark Taylor asks if the home side can reel it in. "Of course," laughs Faulkner.
Sharma was the star here but Virat Kohli's unselfish 91 from 97 was vital. Here's something to consider though: India's total might still be 20-30 under par. Australia's bowlers? None were terrible with debuntants Boland (0-74 off 10) and Paris (0-53 off 8) showing decent signs in trying conditions. Josh Hazlewood was superb with 1-41 from his 10 and James Faulkner his usual effective self wiht 2-60 from 10. Mitchell Marsh and Glenn Maxwell copped some stick but that was always on the cards on a deck like this.
Anyway, I'll hand over to my comrade Geoff Lemon now and he'll take you through the Australian chase. Adios!

 India finish on 309-3 and Rohit Sharma on 171 not out!  
 50th over: India 309-3 (Sharma 171, Jadeja 10) 
Boland is entrusted with the final over and he suffers a little bit of misfortunate again with his second ball, a low full toss that Sharma attempts to clatter over mid-wicket but which flies off a top edge for four over keeper Wade's head. The bowler can't complain about the next, a blatant full toss that Sharma clobbers quite predictably into the stratosphere over long-on. Boland plugs away at a plan for yorkers but they're just not coming out right to Sharma. It finally clicks in his final three deliveries but by then the damage is done; his figures on debut are 0-74 from 10 overs, Sharma's got 171 from 163 and India 309.
 Sharma's best scores against Australia in ODIs now: 264, 209 and 171*. He's a limited overs genius against the Aussies.

Ravi Jadeja's the new man at the crease and he gets straight to work, clubbing Faulkner to the ropes at cow corner and with a bit of pressure on Maxwell on the fence at deep cover, scurrying through for three next up. Faulkner finishes with 2-60 from his 10 overs, a solid effort in the circumstances.

 WICKET! Dhoni c Boland b Faulkner 18 (India 286-3)  
 What a catch!  Boland had an absolute 'mare in his last over but he's pulled off a cracking catch here diving to his right at mid-wicket. Dhoni could have sworn he'd just whacked a boundary but the big quick recovers well from the punishment of his previous over to hold a very tough chance.

 48th over: India 285-2 (Sharma 157, Dhoni 18) 
Okay, so if this doesn't go too horribly it looks as though Scott Boland will bowl overs 48 and 50. Hmm, his second delivery isn't a great moment - a full toss that Sharma clobbers over the rope at cow corner before stroking a single through cover to reach 150 from 155 deliveries. He's hit 12 fours and 5 sixes so far. Superb. Actually make that 6 sixes when he gets under a low full toss and swings it into the stands at long-off. Boland's attempted and missed two yorkers here and paid the price. 300 is now well within reach for the tourists.

Hazlewood ended up with 1-41 from his 10 overs, by the way. Superb in the conditions - a fact that is reinforced when Dhoni cracks Faulkner over the fence at wide long-on and also later in the over, when Sharma plays a cheeky ramp shot to the rope at fine leg. Faulkner hardly erred there but he's been whacked for 15.

There's a huge appeal here by Hazlewood when he thinks Dhoni has gloved one around the corner to Wade but replays reveal that it only glanced his thigh pad. There's also another misfield from Finch, who took that smart catch earlier but has also suffered a dose of the fumbles today. He's blaming his spikes and to be fair, players have slipped on this outfield throughout the Indian innings. Anyway, all of a sudden India look like they'll finish up slightly under par.

Smith's backed Mitchell Marsh here but there's no way of sugar-coating it, his bowler is stinking it up. Kohli hammers him for four to start the over and then slaps another one over cover. In between those there was a comically inept slower-ball bouncer that was so high it was deemed a no-ball. He has to keep it very neat for the rest of the over and does.

He's been a firm hand on the tiller today, Josh Hazlewood, but his reintroduction here is a segue to more Sharma run-scoring as the batsman shaves another boundary down to the third man fence. Kohli also flays him over cover with an ostentatious baseball slap but only gets one for his eye-catching effort. Hazlewood barely put a foot wrong there but he's still conceded six runs for the over.

I haven't mentioned him much of late but Virat Kohli is playing a decent hand here, deferring to his more fluent partner and giving him the strike where possible. It's a solid over from Marsh with four singles the only cost.

Hooley dooley. Sharma really attacks Maxwell here, flogging him for a huge six over the fence at long off but the bowler plays a bit of cat and mouse, pivoting in his follow-through and staring at the batsman rather than watching the ball fly high into the stands. After a single to Rohit, Kohli helps himself to his first boundary in 13 overs when he gets down on one knee with a big slog-sweep to the rope at deep square leg. Maxwell unleashes a stifled LBW shout from the over's final delivery but it's very hopeful.

That's a solid comeback from Paris.

 5th over: India 29-0 (Sharma 20, Dhawan 4) 
It's been a decent effort for the Indian pair to weather this early period, even if the bowling's been a little slipshod at times. There's movement aplenty for bowlers, both in the air and off the pitch. They're just not quite nailing their lines and lengths but this Hazlewood over is far tidier than the last couple.

 4th over: India 28-0 (Sharma 20, Dhawan 3) 
Unless you're a huge fan of Essendon chairman Lindsay Tanner, there wasn't a lot to like about the fourth over of this innings because for Australian viewers, most of it went unseen. Replays reveal that Paris has been hooked for a big six by Sharma and the newbie also fires down a big wide, angling towards firsts lip. Let's hope they stick with the cricket for the rest of the afternoon.

 3rd over: India 20-0 (Sharma 14, Dhawan 2) 
Oof, is that a drop? No. Hazlewood digs in a steepling bouncer to Rohit but his glancing top edge flies ever-so-slightly over the head of a leaping Wade behind the stumps and runs away for four. The last ball of the over? I'm not so sure, because Nine cut away for news on the AFL supplements scandal. As the novelist George Johnston said of Melbourne: there is no summer, only a period of hibernation between football seasons.

 2nd over: India 14-0 (Sharma 8, Dhawan 2) 
The local boy Joel Paris gets to share the new ball in front of his home crowd, who could be forgiven for not entirely recognising him. He only made his first-class debut earlier this season but what a day for him, receiving his Aussie cap from local legend Bruce Reid. His first delivery in international cricket is full, swinging in towards Rohit Sharma's leg stump and gets toed away for a single through Paris's stifled appeal. There's also two driven by Dahawan through cover but plenty else to like from the willowy lefty.

 1st over: India 11-0 (Sharma 7, Dhawan 0) 
Josh Hazlewood takes the new ball for the Aussies, resplendent in their canary yellow uniform. It's about time they abandoned that dark green abomination. The Haze sends his first one down ay half rat power and Rohit Sharma clips it off his pads through mid-wicket for two and then punches even harder next up to pick up a boundary in the same direction. Hazlewood swings the next ball away from the right-hander at a decent rate but then strays down leg again to concede four leg byes. That's a ropey start from the big paceman.

Junior doctors' strike begins in England; 
Operations cancelled in first strike for 40 years, while Midlands hospital orders staff back to wards only two hours into dispute.

Matthew Weaver, Jessica Elgot, Denis Campbell and Haroon Siddique.

Junior doctors have started a 24-hour strike over a new pay and working hours contract, forcing thousands of routine operations to be cancelled.
Hospitals in England have rescheduled about 4,000 non-emergency operations, 13% of the normal daily total. 
In the first strike by hospital doctors in 40 years, up to 38,000 members of the British Medical Association (BMA) began the action at 8am on Tuesday.  
The doctors have agreed to provide emergency care for 24 hours only in the first of two planned strikes this month and have threatened to withdraw emergency services in a third strike in February.
Within two hours of the start of the strike, Sandwell hospital in West Bromwich declared a level four incident and told its junior doctors they must attend work, which the BMA said they should refuse to do. Earlier, Prof Sir Bruce Keogh, the NHS medical director, told hospitals they should order doctors back to work if services became dangerously overstretched. 
Dr Roger Stedman, medical director at the Birmingham hospital's NHS Trust, said Sandwell had had very high numbers of patients come to the hospital, and fewer than usual discharged. Staff striking at Birmingham City hospital were unaffected, he added.
The BMA said it was advising doctors not to return to work for the time being. "Junior doctors should continue with industrial action until NHS England has confirmed and the BMA has agreed - via the agreed escalation process - that a major unpredictable incident is taking place for a specific trust," a spokesman said.
Keogh, in a letter to NHS trusts published by the Telegraph, said on Monday that doctors should be told to return if there was an "exceptional and sustained deterioration in performance", which the BMA said was meddling with doctors' right to strike.
Stedmen said local doctors' representatives in Birmingham had given "constructive support and advice" before the decision was taken to order doctors back to the wards at Sandwell.

Government ministers have declined to comment on the strike since it began, leaving the NHS director to defend the employers' position. 
The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, urged ministers to apologise for the failure to avert a strike. In a post on Facebook he wrote: "No NHS worker takes lightly the decision to strike, but the blame must be laid at the door of this government for the way it has treated doctors and now seeks to smear them in the press. It is time for this government to apologise to junior doctors and negotiate a fair deal that gets our NHS working again."
Sir Robert Francis QC, who led the inquiry into the Mid Staffordshire scandal and is a non-executive director of the Care Quality Commission, said industrial action would only "compromise patient safety".
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: "The only way that matters can be solved for doctors and patients is for talks to continue and for emergency care not to be withdrawn." 
But Francis said the government should listen to doctors and explain their offer to them more clearly. He said: "I quite understand why many of them [doctors] feel angry. They need to be listened to. 
"One thing I would ask is done is that a better explanation is given to them all as to what the effects of any offer being made on them is personally. I'm not entirely confident that that has yet happened."
The BMA said it had been forced to act after ministers refused to heed its concerns that the new contract proposed by Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary would be unfair on doctors and reduce patient safety. Approximately 98% of its members backed strike action in a ballot in November.
They are opposed to Hunt's plan to classify Saturday as part of a junior doctor's normal working week for which they are paid at only the basic rate. He also wants to see the portion of weekday evenings classified as normal time extended from 7pm to 10pm, but junior doctors fear this will lead to cuts in their pay.
Hunt has offered to raise junior doctors' basic pay by 11% to offset the loss of overtime they currently earn for working in the evening and on Saturday, and has promised that no junior will be worse off under the new contract, which is due to start in August.
A fresh opinion poll suggests that despite Hunt's efforts to portray the walkout as politically motivated and based on misinformation from the BMA, the public is largely behind the strike. An Ipsos Mori poll for the Health Service Journal found that 66% of 869 people polled support action such as that planned on Tuesday - where juniors due on duty in emergency care areas still turn up to work - with only 16% completely against.
Katherine Murphy, the chief executive of the Patients Association, said that while she sympathised with junior doctors, industrial action would cause "a great deal of distress for many patients, who continue to be caught in the middle of this dispute". 
She urged the BMA and ministers to resume talks as soon as possible to agree a deal before the second of three planned strikes, from 26-28 January.

The new alcohol limits are a smokescreen for governmental inaction; 
Public health advice is too often corrupted, with evidence being used selectively to disguise the need to tackle corporate interests.

Julian Baggini.

"Information wants to be free," declared the writer Stewart Brand 30 years ago, and it seems its wish has largely been granted. But information has always been an important political tool, and just because recent UK governments don't abuse it quite as brazenly as dictatorships, that doesn't mean they have given up wielding it as a weapon.
 Related:  Do the new alcohol guidelines help us understand the risks of drinking? 
It might seem an odd time to worry about this in a country where state-delivered information is increasingly provided by independent sources, such as the chief medical officers and the Financial Conduct Authority. Both have come under fire in recent days, accused of doing the government's bidding. But the abuse of information by governments is rarely as crude as an order from on high or overt pressure to falsify it. As a result, it often goes unnoticed.
Indeed, information is often distorted without anyone deliberately twisting it. Scientists and statisticians often serve the interests of their paymasters, without any corruption or incompetence.
Experimenter bias is a well-researched phenomenon that shows that even people of the utmost integrity and good intentions are swayed in their judgments by various factors, including who pays them. That is why it was such a scandal when Andrew Wakefield failed to declare that his research linking autism and the MMR vaccine was largely funded by people seeking to establish the connection. So when people such as the chief medical officer for England, Sally Davies, and the acting chief of the Financial Conduct Authority, Tracey McDermott, insist they have not been influenced by the government, you don't have to question their sincerity or professionalism to doubt them.
Information is being used as a smokescreen to cover up the government's wilful inaction
That might help explain the egregiously selective use of evidence behind the new alcohol consumption guidelines. The health evidence expert group advising the chief medical officers seems to have based its findings only on studies connecting alcohol consumption with specific risks or benefits, concluding that the proven links to harms are greater than those to gains. However, it has ignored the numerous meta-surveys that have concluded that moderate drinking improves general health and life expectancy compared to being teetotal. Hence according to one such major study, drinkers are only at greater danger than non-drinkers once they are downing more than 4-5 units a day.
New, stricter guidelines may lack scientific credibility but they suit the agenda they are being used to support. These new guidelines are not just information for people to take or leave, they provide advice we are being urged to follow. Given the stress on the importance of evidence, this is baffling since guidelines just don't work as public health interventions. Even the chief medical officers admitted that the behavioural expert group advising them "found little evidence regarding the impact of any guidelines in changing health behaviours". Similarly, four years ago the science and technology select committee reported that "the government views the guidelines as a tool to influence drinking behaviour when there is very little evidence that the guidelines have been effective at this".
If this government really wanted to tackle the harms caused by alcohol abuse there are several things it could do, such as following the advice in the report Health First, prepared by researchers at the University of Stirling two years ago. You will find no calls to issue advice on consumption limits among its top 10 recommendations. Instead, it advocates a minimum unit price, the banning of advertising and promotions that encourage drinkers to buy more, and a reduction in the legal drink-driving limits. This is, as they call it, a genuinely "evidence-based alcohol strategy for the UK", aimed at reducing the truly harmful forms of excessive drinking.
There are similar ways to tackle many other public health problems, such as those caused by sugary drinks and lack of exercise. We need smart taxes, limits on deceptive advertising and manipulative marketing, and proper investment in affordable municipal health and fitness facilities. That, however, requires more government action and stricter limits on corporate power, neither of which this government is keen on.
So in place of effective interventions we have information and advice, all presented as though it were nothing more than objective, non-politicised science. Far from bringing helpful clarity, information is being used as a smokescreen to cover up the government's wilful inaction, which serves corporate interests rather than the public good.
There is a reason why the saying is knowledge - not information - is power. To be truly empowered we need both to better understand the information we are given, and to realise that the biggest abuses of information concern how it is used, not how it is gathered.

 That innings in brief 
"It's not much fun," concedes Australian all-rounder James Faulkner of bowling to Rohit Sharma, whose 171 not out from 163 deliveries featured 13 fours and 7 sixes. "It's in our hands now to chase the total," he adds. Mark Taylor asks if the home side can reel it in. "Of course," laughs Faulkner.
Sharma was the star here but Virat Kohli's unselfish 91 from 97 was vital. Here's something to consider though: India's total might still be 20-30 under par. Australia's bowlers? None were terrible with debuntants Boland (0-74 off 10) and Paris (0-53 off 8) showing decent signs in trying conditions. Josh Hazlewood was superb with 1-41 from his 10 and James Faulkner his usual effective self wiht 2-60 from 10. Mitchell Marsh and Glenn Maxwell copped some stick but that was always on the cards on a deck like this.
Anyway, I'll hand over to my comrade Geoff Lemon now and he'll take you through the Australian chase. Adios!

 India finish on 309-3 and Rohit Sharma on 171 not out!  
 50th over: India 309-3 (Sharma 171, Jadeja 10) 
Boland is entrusted with the final over and he suffers a little bit of misfortunate again with his second ball, a low full toss that Sharma attempts to clatter over mid-wicket but which flies off a top edge for four over keeper Wade's head. The bowler can't complain about the next, a blatant full toss that Sharma clobbers quite predictably into the stratosphere over long-on. Boland plugs away at a plan for yorkers but they're just not coming out right to Sharma. It finally clicks in his final three deliveries but by then the damage is done; his figures on debut are 0-74 from 10 overs, Sharma's got 171 from 163 and India 309.
 Sharma's best scores against Australia in ODIs now: 264, 209 and 171*. He's a limited overs genius against the Aussies.

Faulkner finishes with 2-60 from his 10 overs, a solid effort in the circumstances.

 What a catch!  Boland had an absolute 'mare in his last over but he's pulled off a cracking catch here diving to his right at mid-wicket. Dhoni could have sworn he'd just whacked a boundary but the big quick recovers well from the punishment of his previous over to hold a very tough chance.

Okay, so if this doesn't go too horribly it looks as though Scott Boland will bowl overs 48 and 50. Hmm, his second delivery isn't a great moment - a full toss that Sharma clobbers over the rope at cow corner before stroking a single through cover to reach 150 from 155 deliveries. He's hit 12 fours and 5 sixes so far. Superb. Actually make that 6 sixes when he gets under a low full toss and swings it into the stands at long-off. Boland's attempted and missed two yorkers here and paid the price. 300 is now well within reach for the tourists.
This is huge:

Hazlewood ended up with 1-41 from his 10 overs, by the way. Superb in the conditions - a fact that is reinforced when Dhoni cracks Faulkner over the fence at wide long-on and also later in the over, when Sharma plays a cheeky ramp shot to the rope at fine leg. Faulkner hardly erred there but he's been whacked for 15.

There's a huge appeal here by Hazlewood when he thinks Dhoni has gloved one around the corner to Wade but replays reveal that it only glanced his thigh pad. There's also another misfield from Finch, who took that smart catch earlier but has also suffered a dose of the fumbles today. He's blaming his spikes and to be fair, players have slipped on this outfield throughout the Indian innings. Anyway, all of a sudden India look like they'll finish up slightly under par.

Smith's backed Mitchell Marsh here but there's no way of sugar-coating it, his bowler is stinking it up. Kohli hammers him for four to start the over and then slaps another one over cover.

Kohli also flays him over cover with an ostentatious baseball slap but only gets one for his eye-catching effort. Hazlewood barely put a foot wrong there but he's still conceded six runs for the over.

Hooley dooley. Sharma really attacks Maxwell here, flogging him for a huge six over the fence at long off but the bowler plays a bit of cat and mouse, pivoting in his follow-through and staring at the batsman rather than watching the ball fly high into the stands. After a single to Rohit, Kohli helps himself to his first boundary in 13 overs when he gets down on one knee with a big slog-sweep to the rope at deep square leg. Maxwell unleashes a stifled LBW shout from the over's final delivery but it's very hopeful.

No cover-up, pledges Coe, as new report on athletics doping threatens more pain; 
IAAF president says he understands gravity of the issue as senior figures say crisis engulfing sport is worse than Fifa scandal.

Owen Gibson Chief sports correspondent.

Sebastian Coe, the president of world athletics' embattled governing body, will be under further pressure on Thursday as fresh allegations are outlined of widespread corruption at the heart of the sport.
The crisis facing world athletics has grown over the past two years to the level where many consider it to be worse than the turmoil enveloping Fifa that led to the downfall of Sepp Blatter, mass arrests by the US Department of Justice and a generation of executives being implicated in a $200m-plus bribery scandal.
Dick Pound, the former president of World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada), today presents the second part of his report into systemic doping in Russia and attempted cover-ups at the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). He is among those who believe the scandal in athletics is worse because it "affects the results on the field of play" as opposed to "moving money around like the Fifa boys". 
In broadcast interviews ahead of the publication of Pound's report, which is expected to be an indictment of the role of the IAAF in the scandal, Lord Coe - who was a vice-president for seven years under the previous regime - insisted there was "no cover-up" and he had not "for one moment" regretted taking the role.
"One of the accusations is that I don't get the seriousness of this issue. I do. I am dealing with it every day and have been dealing with this since effectively I took over as president," he told CNN.
Last week, senior figures at the IAAF - including the son of Coe's predecessor and the head of the anti-doping unit - were banned, along with the head of the Russian athletics federation, following an ethics commission investigation that showed in shocking detail how they had attempted to subvert the testing system and extort money from the marathon runner Liliya Shobukhova.

Since well before Coe took over in August, there has been a series of revelations linking the systemic doping in Russia, which saw the country banned from competition in the wake of Pound's first report, to cover-ups and corruption at the IAAF's headquarters in Monaco.
The Guardian revealed this week that Papa Massata Diack, who acted as a marketing consultant for the IAAF, had apparently sent an email to International Olympic Committee members in 2008 arranging for "parcels" to be delivered to senior IOC members, while the French newspaper Le Monde claimed he had paid $50,000 in cash to Gabriel Dolle, the former head of the IAAF's anti-doping unit, to keep quiet about positive tests.
A large leak of documents to the Associated Press this week showed senior IAAF officials knew as long ago as 2009 that the Russian blood doping was so serious that athletes risked dying and that Diack was warned in September 2012 that 42% of Russian elite athletes were doping.
Ahead of today's press conference in Munich, Pound said: "The second report will consist of the possible criminal actions on the part of individuals, in response to the generalised claim that the IAAF did not follow up on positive test results."
When the Sunday Times and German broadcaster ARD made those claims in the summer, Coe insisted they amounted to a "war on my sport". But he has faced a barrage of criticism over his handling of the crisis and questions about what he knew and when. The former London 2012 chairman and double Olympic gold medallist was also forced to give up his ambassadorial role at Nike after he admitted allegations of a conflict of interest had become an unwanted distraction.
After Pound presents the second report, after the first in November blew the lid on systemic state-sponsored doping in Russia, the French financial prosecutor Eliane Houlette will take the unusual step of delivering an update on an ongoing criminal investigation.
Also in November, the former IAAF president Lamine Diack was arrested over allegations that he accepted more than (EURO)1m in bribes to cover up doping violations. His legal adviser, Habib Cisse, and Dolle were also arrested, while French prosecutors said Diack, Lamine's son who acted as a marketing consultant for the IAAF for eight years with a focus on developing markets, was told he would be questioned if he set foot in France.
Diack was last week banned for life from the sport and Dolle, who the Guardian revealed had stepped down from his role last year amid an ethics investigation, was banned for five years following an investigation by the IAAF's independent ethics commission.
Coe, who delivered a glowing tribute to Diack when he succeeded him in August, calling him his "spiritual president", has said he was shocked by the involvement of the 82-year-old Senegalese in the corruption allegations. He has also argued that his role as vice-president was limited to just 10 days of active duty a year and that his focus until 2012 was entirely on delivering the London Olympics.
Much of the pressure on Coe stems from whether he should have questioned more closely the scale of the Russian doping crisis, which was being openly discussed in IAAF circles, and from his previous loyalty to Diack.
His supporters point to his role in setting up the independent ethics committee that revealed the scale of the Russian cover-up and argue, that without Diack's support he would never have been able to win the presidency and the current situation would be even worse. Pound said in his report that the London Games was "sabotaged" by Russian doping and the participation of athletes who should have been banned.
The internal documents leaked this week to the Associated Press showed how Cisse and Dolle considered covering up Russian tests ahead of the Games.
"Our sport is a strong sport," insisted Coe on Wednesday. "Don't run away with the idea that I don't know these are dark days. Of course they're dark days."
Pound, who also criticised Wada in his first report, is also expected to recommend inquiries into the scale of doping in other countries such as Kenya and Turkey.
Renee Anne Shirley, the former head of the Jamaican Anti-Doping Commission and a trenchant critic of the IAAF's handling the issue, said it would be "interesting seeing Coe's continued tired defence of his sport" and believed it had "lost the moral high ground".
Coe focuses on changes he is driving through, including proposals for a new integrity unit and to double the anti-doping budget that he can save athletics.

Lin Homer, Dame Disaster, puts in a classic display before MPs; 
HMRC chief switches to default setting when asked about HSBC scandal - saying nothing much to appear on top of her brief.

John Crace.

Just imagine the rewards for success. Lin Homer, the chief executive of HMRC, was made a dame in the New Year honours list after a year in which her organisation was accused of letting HSBC get away with systematic tax evasion and providing abysmal levels of service to the public.
This on top of a career in which she resigned as chief executive of Birmingham city council following a vote rigging scandal, and accidentally allowing more than 100,000 asylum seekers to stay in the country when she was head of the UK Border Agency. 
 Related:  HMRC chief Lin Homer to step down
"Welcome Dame Lin," said Meg Hillier, chair of the public accounts committee (PAC), as Dame Disaster prepared to face what should be her last hearing before disappearing into the sunset with her £2.2m pension.
"Thank you," replied Dame Disaster, looking only moderately surprised not to have been made a countess for her contribution to public life.
The PAC is a much tamer affair now that Margaret Hodge has stood down as its chair, but it does still have its own pet rotty in the bullet-headed Stephen Phillips who manages to fit in his work as MP with a £750,000 day job as a QC. There's nothing Phillips likes more than raw meat, and in Homer he has easy prey.
What did Dame Disaster think about the fact the Financial Conduct Authority wasn't going to pursue criminal charges against HSBC ? Dame Disaster had no real feelings about it one way or the other.
Hadn't HMRC failed to provide the FCA with evidence because the French wouldn't like it? Dame Disaster said she wouldn't put it quite like that but, basically, yes. Hadn't the French long since said they would have been quite happy for HMRC to share their data with the FCA. Dame Disaster agreed that was one possible interpretation of the French saying, "Oui".
"So HSBC have got away scot-free," Phillips concluded.
 Related:  HSBC escapes action by City regulator following Swiss tax scandal
Dame Disaster merely shrugged. What else did he expect? Wasn't it for exactly that kind of incompetence she had been made a dame?
Phillips sat back theatrically and let the others have a go. Dame Disaster visibly relaxed and returned to her default setting of saying nothing very much in as incomprehensible manner as possible to make it look like she was on top of her brief.
To be fair to Dame Disaster, she's a marginally sharper pencil than her sidekick, Jennie Granger, HMRC's director general of fraud and compliance; though the bar is admittedly very low. Granger's method of answering questions on why £16bn of tax remains uncollected each year, either through fraud or evasion, was to start her answers in an almost inaudible whisper and to end them mouthing random words. By which time, no one - not even her - was any the wiser.
Fortunately Dame Disaster was on hand to help her out. What the committee should really be looking at was how well HMRC was doing to limit the tax gap to just £16bn. For some reason, the committee was reluctant to see her point of view.
"Can we stay on this topic?" asked the Conservative MP Nigel Mills.
"What is this topic?" replied Dame Disaster. That's what she gets the big bucks for.
 Related:  New Year honours 2016: the full list
Mills tried another tack. That extra £7.2bn the chancellor had assured everyone in his autumn statement would come flooding into the Treasury coffers by cracking down on tax fraud and the black economy: how certain was she of that money materialising.
"Oh, that money!" replied Dame Disaster. "I'm not at all certain really." Getting money out of tax cheats was very tricky and we were lucky to be getting as much as we were.
Somewhere over in the Treasury, George Osborne let out a loud howl of anguish. He'd put her name forward for an honour and she'd repaid him by dumping him in the mire. Dame Disaster has promised not to embarrass the government by taking a compromising job in the private sector when she leaves. It will make a change from doing a job in which she embarrasses herself.

Chris Froome-style power data should be open to all, Brailsford tells UCI; 
∑ Team Sky chief wants wider public access to all riders' statistics ∑ Standardised disclosure of data would benefit cycling, says Brailsford.

William Fotheringham.

Sir Dave Brailsford has written to the UCI suggesting it works with professional teams towards giving public access to a range of power and physiological data from all their riders. His move comes in the wake of the controversy during last year's Tour de France about what power the double winner Chris Froome might be producing on his bike and what it may mean.
 Related:  Chris Froome: Olympic Games are overwhelming but Tour is foremost 
In the past Brailsford has said the release of data across the board would not be helpful because the raw material would merely provide grist to the mill of conspiracy theory, and that it may well, in some cases, give rivals a competitive edge.
Speaking at Team Sky's season-opening media day on Tuesday, he said: "I've actually written to [the UCI president] Brian Cookson about this because it strikes me on the whole releasing of data - data in terms of power, the key climbs - it seems to me that's a sport-wide issue, it's not a Team Sky issue or an issue for one rider.
"It's obviously impacting the sport and impacting a lot of people in terms of how they're interpreting a rider and the sport. That's why I wrote to Brian. It should be standardised. If we all agree, what I want is to take away the element of: 'Well, Team Sky are willing to do this or they're not willing to do this.' If we all agreed as teams that here is the disclosure model that we're all going to do, all going to buy into, it takes away that discretionary decision of we're willing to or not willing to [and hence] they're open or they're not open.
"Brian has written back to say he thinks it's definitely worth discussing but it's not easy to do. I'd like to think we could get to a position where we recognise this is not something that's going to go away but as a sport we could address it rather than leaving it to one rider or one team. I think it would help the sport."
Brailsford added: "We feel under a lot of pressure. We get asked more than any other team about data. Our riders, particularly Chris, get asked more about data. The onus falls on us and whatever decision we make and how people interpret that in terms of our willingness to be open or not. But if we all had an agreement that 'right, this is what we are going to do as a sport in general', that's a better way of thinking about it."
To some extent Sky have had their hand forced because other teams such as Giant-Alpecin have made data public either officially or through the website Strava, which publishes riders' power data as well as their times for climbs. Ironically, it almost mirrors the position taken by one of Sky's main critics, the former Festina trainer Antoine Vayer, who called for teams to release data across the board in a Guardian interview in July : "Everyone asks if they are clean. If I say yes, they laugh and say 'prove it'. To say riders are clean, you need the data."
 Related:  Sport picture of the day: the long and winding road in Majorca for Team Sky
By the second rest-day of the Tour, after speculation on French television over Froome's figures, Brailsford, the rider and Sky had decided to make a limited amount of his data public. At the time, Froome said he would be willing to release more, providing all other teams did the same; the double Tour winner went one step further in early December by putting on view the findings of independent physiological tests carried out immediately after the Tour at the GSK Human Performance laboratory in London.
Brailsford added that in his view, the controversies in athletics were leading that sport into a similar situation faced by cycling in 1998 after the Festina scandal revealed widespread doping. "If you compare it to our sport a point in time came with an event that was the straw that broke the camel's back. Something now has to be done [in athletics]," he said. "While that felt pretty tough at the time for our sport, it is in a much better place now. Better than maybe it ever has been.
"My experience would say don't wait. Look in the mirror. Warts and all. Get it all out. The sooner the better. If you really want to get over those hurdles now you increase your chances of being able to move forward. I think now they have an opportunity, as tough as it may seem."

America Ferrera and Jennifer Lopez: 'It's a very special moment' in TV for Latinas; 
The two actors, who both have new shows, address whether progress has been made on the small screen during the Television Critics Association press tour.

Nigel M Smith in Los Angeles.

"I think this was the first part that was offered to me that wasn't specified 'Latina',' said actor America Ferrera of her involvement in NBC's new comedy  Superstore, during the show's panel at the Television Critics Association winter press tour in Pasadena, California on Tuesday.
The former Ugly Betty star, who has not had a series regular role since ABC ended that show's run in 2010, has addressed the lack of Latino representation in television and film before. Last March, the actor told  the Huffington Post  that although she was overjoyed to see Gina Rodriguez become the second Latina actor to take home a Golden Globe in 2015 following her own win in 2007 for Ugly Betty, Ferrera expressed dismay that there haven't been more Latina winners over the years. "It's a little disheartening to know that there are only two of us," Ferrera said at the time. 
 Related:  Superstore: Walmart-inspired sitcom isn't such a bad deal
During Superstore's panel, the actor said she was surprised that Ugly Betty didn't represent a "watershed moment" for Latinos on television. Said Ferrera: "We went off the air, and it was years until you saw another Latino [on television]."
"When it comes to diversity and breaking stereotypes, and finding opportunities for non-white actors, progress gets made in these individual steps - and we should celebrate them and reward them, especially when they're successful," she continued. "But I do think it's important to kind of also acknowledge that we have successes that don't necessarily end up in up watershed moments for diversity on television."
Ferrera did go out of her way to applaud NBC for what she deems a historic moment for television: this year, the network has three news shows fronted by Latina actors. On top of Superstore starring Ferrera, Jennifer Lopez heads the police drama Shades of Blue, while Desperate Housewives' Eva Longoria is front and center in Telenovela, a parody of the popular Latin soap operas. "It's a very special moment," said Ferrera.

Lopez, speaking during the Shades of Blue conference that followed, cited Grey's Anatomy and Scandal showrunner Shonda Rhimes as having a major influence in advancing minority representation on the small screen. "To me, that's when TV got interesting again," she said of Grey's Anatomy. The actor said that following the hit medical drama, seeing actors of colour onscreen has become "more of the norm". "There's been more of a shift in the past year or so," added Lopez. "Television has always been great at reflecting society since way back - and pushing the boundaries of what's happening in life. I think it's no different right now."
Asked to look to the future, Ferrera said she's "always hoping for the best".
"It's not just about Latinos, it's about Asian representation, African American representation. The more we talk about it, and the more about how its succeeding and of people being hungry to seeing stories like this, I think will encourage other networks to enrich their storytelling by reflecting the world that we actually live in."

Superstore airs Mondays on NBC; Shades of Blue, Thursdays.

Snooper's charter: cafes and libraries face having to store Wi-Fi users' data; 
Theresa May gives first hint costs may far exceed £240m estimate as it emerges even small-scale providers could be targeted.

Alan Travis Home affairs editor.

Coffee shops running Wi-Fi networks may have to store internet data under new snooping laws, Theresa May has said.
Small-scale networks such as those in cafes, libraries and universities could find themselves targeted under the legislation and forced to hand over customers' confidential personal data tracking their web use.
 Related:  Why journalists should challenge the new surveillance powers 
The home secretary has also given her first hint that the costs of her snooper's charter are likely to go far beyond the official £240m estimate. May told peers and MPs that talks were under way with internet and phone companies over costs and their technical capacity to deliver the measures, after being told that Vodafone, O2 and EE had testified that each company could each spend that amount alone in implementing the proposed surveillance law.
During nearly two hours of questioning by the joint parliamentary scrutiny committee on her bill, the home secretary revealed that small-scale internet providers would not be excluded from the requirement to store their customer's internet records for up to 12 months.
"I do not think it would be right for us to exclude any networks," she told MPs and peers. "If you look at how people do their business these days, it is on the move."
May rejected demands from the information commissioner and from the defence and security industries that there should be a "sunset clause" on the legislation ensuring it would be revisited within five to seven years to cope with the rapid pace of technological change. She insisted the bill was "technology neutral" and fit for a rapidly changing technological world.
 Related:  Mass snooping and more - the measures in Theresa May's bill
The home secretary had no answer when questioned by MPs and peers as to how she would enforce legal notices requiring overseas internet and technology companies, such as Apple, Facebook, Twitter and Google, to store their customers' communications data records for 12 months and to hand them over to British police and security agencies on request. May said they were still examining issues of "extra-territoriality".
She did, however, attempt to reassure the scrutiny committee that judicial commissioners, to be appointed to operate a "double-lock" authorisation process on intercept and bulk interception warrants, would have sufficient flexibility to examine decisions taken by cabinet ministers to order intrusive snooping operations.
The scrutiny committee has had only two and a half months to examine the 300-page bill which is being introduced in the wake of disclosures by the whistleblower Edward Snowden, uncovering mass surveillance and bulk collection programmes operated by Britain's GCHQ and the National Security Agency in the US. The committee is to produce its pre-legislative scrutiny report by 9 February before the bill is given a Commons second reading.
The issue of the costs faced by the internet and phone companies in complying with the bill's requirements to collect, store and retain for 12 months all their customers' communications data tracking their individual use of the web, email and mobile phones could prove a serious difficulty for the Home Office.
 Related:  The Guardian view on surveillance: citizens must be the state's master. Not its plaything | Editorial
The Labour MP David Hanson raised the issue with May, saying that Vodafone, EE, O2 and Three had testified in evidence that they could each spend £240m alone and were troubled about their current capacity to deliver compliance with the legislation on budget and on time. O2 had said the costs involved will be "huge", while EE said that if there was any cap or limit on the government reimbursing their costs for storing the data involved, it could make things very difficult.
May made clear that the government had agreed to underwrite the costs involved in the companies' complying with the bill on a "cost recovery basis". She said the Home Office was in talks with the companies but insisted that the initial estimate had not been "plucked out of the air".
She said: "We have provided some indicative figures. We are still in discussion with individual communication service providers about ways in which these capabilities are to be provided. We will have reasonable cost recovery when we require these companies to provide these capabilities."
May said that she had spoken to the companies about the sums of money involved and the technical feasibility and that they had been responsive.

America is finally waking up to its inequality problem; 
Under Obama, the economic recovery has bypassed almost all Americans. They won't stay silent for ever - and Bernie Sanders could be their inspiration.

Owen Jones.

To critique Barack Obama's presidency is to be guilty of these cardinal sins: blasphemy, ingratitude and a lack of realism. What was once the nation of Jim Crow produced the first African-American president, the most liberal commander-in-chief since Richard Nixon (as Obama himself once put it ). Funny, charming, with a coolness that eludes practically every other politician, he is the ultimate ambassador for US power. Could the United States possibly elect someone more progressive?
 Related:  Why does Bernie Sanders continue to avoid a foreign policy platform? | Lucia Graves 
And yet it is difficult not to conclude that, as Obama delivers his final State of the Union address, the US remains a chronically unjust and devastatingly unequal society, its proud democracy beholden to powerful and wealthy interests. It is this potential tinderbox that makes the implausibly clown-like, quasi-fascist Donald Trump the Republican frontrunner; and, more hopefully, a 74-year-old self-described socialist from Vermont - Bernie Sanders -a serious challenger to the Clinton machine.
That's not to diminish Obama's achievements. The lack of universal healthcare has long made the US a baffling aberration among developed nations; Obamacare's significantly increased coverage should not be sniffed at. Obama's U-turn on his public stance on equal marriage - yes, made possible by the struggle and sacrifice of US LGBT activists - is another triumph. His recent activism on the great US guns scandal and the existential threat of climate change is to be applauded, too.
But consider the plight of the majority of Americans. We know that, six years into his presidency, poverty was still higher than before the financial system near-imploded. While child poverty has been alleviated for many Americans in the past five years, for African-Americans it has remained stubbornly constant.
The gains of economic recovery have certainly been beneficial to those of great wealth - including the culprits behind the crash - but have meant little to the average American. Of course, that has everything to do with the structure of the US economy since Ronald Reagan swept to power. Consider this: according to the Economic Policy Institute - a thinktank close to the embattled US labour movement - between 1979 and 2007, the top 1% seized 53.9% of the entire increase in US income. It is often suggested that male median income has been stagnant in the US since the 1970s, hidden only by a flood of women into the workforce: how that's worked out depends on all sorts of qualifications, such as which price index you choose. Yet even by the most optimistic calculations, if university-educated American men have enjoyed a boost in salaries, those with only high school qualifications endured sliding incomes between 1979 and 2013.
But if Reaganism engineered this model, Obamaism failed to replace it. According to Emmanuel Saez, a US economics professor, between Obama's inauguration in 2009 and 2013, pre-tax income among the top 1% has jumped from $871,100 to $968,000 ; for everybody else, it practically stood still.
Yes, the top 1% suffered a bigger hit in the crash (but how they bounced back), employers' healthcare contributions have to be factored in, and Obama's administration introduced a more progressive tax system than the one Bush bequeathed. Yet here is an economy structurally geared to favour the very wealthiest. A woman in a full-time job takes home the same paypacket as she did in 2007; a man, slightly less. In 2014, hourly wages after inflation were falling or flatlining for most American workers. US workers might be more productive, but they will struggle to see the gains in their bank balances.
 Related:  Bernie Sanders: free public college tuition is the 'right thing to do'
That's before we even deal with foreign policy. We all know of Bush's Iraq folly, opposed by Obama himself; but, as Isis marches across the coast of chaos-ravaged Libya, we spend too little time addressing the president's own foreign calamity. Drones that former US service personnel have described as recruiting sergeants for Isis ; the failure to redeem his promise to shut Guant·namo ; the failure to secure a just peace in Palestine.
Across the western world, popular discontent is either being funnelled into the ranks of the xenophobic populist right, or new progressive movements of the left. For all too many struggling middle-income and poor Americans, it is Trump who has become the answer, directing their anger at anyone but the powerful. But whether or not Bernie Sanders secures the nomination, his movement offers some hope to cure the ills of modern America.
Without the support of Big Money, Sanders's grassroots campaign raised $73m last year. With primary elections looming, Hillary Clinton is now in a dead heat with Sanders in Iowa; in New Hampshire, he is ahead. His movement could transform the Democrat party.
None of this is to scapegoat Obama. Even the most well-intentioned president will struggle against a system described last year by Princeton researchers as an "oligarchy", where the median net worth of a senator in 2013 was $2.8m. But fewer Americans are self-identifying as conservative ; younger Americans have far more progressive views than their elders. Black Lives Matter and Occupy have forced long-ignored issues on to the agenda.
Obama's presidency has failed to build the just America its citizens deserve. But the US has a proud history of bottom-up movements that have overcome injustice. Their time may have come again.

The Guardian view on the geopolitics of falling oil prices; 
Some rue the get-rich-quick allure of oil in emerging nations. Whatever happens, the geopolitical consequences of falling prices are myriad and unpredictable.

Editorial.

In the geopolitics of oil production, predictions are always risky. However important it may be, the price of crude is never the single factor driving events. That a global shakeup will occur  if the spectacular tumble in prices persists is, however, a fairly safe bet. Witness how record highs and lows in oil have affected international relations and political developments over the last four decades.
The oil shocks of the 1970s reshaped the global landscape and lent new significance to the Middle East. When prices collapsed in the mid-1980s, the Soviet Union's final demise owed much to the collapse in its export revenues. Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait derived in part from an ambition to capture new lands at a time of financial stringency. In Algeria, another country dependent on oil revenues, that same price collapse - which reduced the price of crude to below $10 a barrel - contributed to an election victory for Islamists, then a coup, and then civil war. All of this makes it difficult to draw clearcut conclusions about strategic winners and losers. Of course, the liberal democracies of the west benefited from the end of the Soviet bloc, but it is hard to argue that low oil prices in the Arab and Muslim world led to much peace and stability. 
 Related:  The Guardian view on the economic and environmental impact of falling oil prices | Editorial
One safe observation today is that the slump in global oil prices has notably dimmed hopes that emerging powers might continue their growth and modernisation, simultaneously becoming solid stakeholders in a stable international order. Too many had based their ambitions on the high commodity prices that are now in freefall. As the head of the IMF, Christine Lagarde, commented this week, now they face a "new reality" of slow growth and worrying uncertainty. To take one example: Brazil, formerly described as a champion of the global south, is now reeling because of its challenged economy - made worse by a corruption scandal centred on its oil giant Petrobras. Brazil is a democracy; instability there is unwelcome news. Nor will low oil prices help the new government in Nigeria, Africa's number one oil-producer, at a time when jihadi networks are spreading across that region and beyond.
But if a falling oil price hurts those countries the west would view warmly, it also has the power to hurt those it would regard as adversaries. In Russia, Vladimir Putin appears determined to re-establish his nation as a major power through military adventurism on the European continent and in the Middle East. Now he will increasingly find himself confronted with a complex financial equation. A 10% cut in public spending has just been announced, a clear sign of stress from the double whammy of international sanctions and low commodity prices in an economy that depends on crude at $100 a barrel. Regimes similarly affected by the falling oil price might want to turn to their sovereign wealth funds to compensate, but those are not unlimited.
Venezuela is another example of the pitfalls of what is sometimes called the resource curse, over-dependency on oil at the expense of modernisation and diversification. There will be regional consequences as Venezuela's "Bolivarian" model struggles, not the least of which will be felt by Cuba, long supported by Venezuelan subsidies and now opening a new chapter of relations with the US.
But nowhere are the geopolitical consequences of low oil prices more unpredictable than in the Middle East. For Saudi Arabia, orchestrating the price drop, it is a key factor that might weaken its regional rival Iran as the latter returns to the oil export market. But low prices also represent a domestic challenge to the Gulf dynasties. That might eventually discourage belligerence; but in the short term it could fuel it as insecure regimes seek to deflect attention from domestic tensions. Russia could well respond that way, and China's reaction is equally unpredictable. Among the knowns and the unknowns, it is certain that too little oil revenue can be as damaging as too much.

Sun faces phone-hacking claims from five high court claimants; 
Documents laid before the court include allegations that phone hacking took place at the Sun from 2000 until 2006.

Jasper Jackson.

A bid to establish whether the Sun was involved in phone hacking has been launched at at a hearing dealing with allegations from 16 celebrities and public figures against the newspaper's publisher, News Group Newspapers. 
The high court heard that of the 16 claimants, who include former EastEnders and Coronation Street actors, five allege that articles published in the Sun were obtained by the hacking of phones. The others say they were targeted by the now defunct News of the World.
The claims presented in court include examples provided by Simon Clegg, the former chief executive of the British Olympic Association, who says around half of the articles he alleges were obtained through phone hacking were published in the Sun. 
Lawyers for NGN say the stories about Clegg, who led the campaign to persuade the government to bid for the 2012 Olympics, were sourced through legitimate means.
Other celebrities who are part of the case against the two newspapers include the former FamilyFortunes presenter Les Dennis, Hear'Say singer and Coronation Street actor Kym Marsh and Doctors actor Sarah Manners. Documents laid before the court include allegations that phone hacking took place at the Sun from at least 2000 onwards and cite examples up to 2006, when the NoW royal editor Clive Goodman and the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire were arrested for intercepting voicemails.
The claimants are seeking disclosure of records from the Sun, similar to those produced by News UK for NoW. 
Anthony White QC, representing NGN, said the defendant should be given more time to present an argument against the disclosure, saying a "similar regime" at the News of the World had generated costs of £13m. "If we have to put in place a disclosure regime for the Sun going back to 1998, we would have to do so from scratch," he said.
A decision on whether the claims against the Sun can proceed to trial will be delayed until a later hearing before April.
Lawyers for those making claims against NoW said that stories produced by the paper's features section were the work of more than one individual.
The hearing comes more than a year after the former Sun editor Rebekah Brooks was cleared of all charges related to phone hacking at NoW. Brooks has since returned to become chief executive of the paper's parent company, News UK.

Cutting diesel pollution puts climate change target at risk, says VW UK chief; 
Boss of carmaker that cheated on tests of toxic NOx emissions downplays impact of scandal and says diesel vehicles needed to reduce CO2 levels.

Adam Vaughan.

Taking too many diesel cars off the road because they have been blamed for Europe's air pollution problems would risk the industry missing its climate change targets, the boss of Volkswagen UK has warned.

Last year it emerged that Volkswagen had cheated on tests for emissions of nitrogen oxides (chemical name NOx), the name for the toxic gases nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (chemical name NO 2), both of which are found in diesel fumes. Paul Willis, managing director of VW UK, told MPs on Wednesday that tackling NO2 emissions could come at the expense of cutting carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from cars - the greenhouse gas seen as a major contributor to climate change. 
NO2 is responsible for nearly 6,000 annual premature deaths in London, parts of which breached annual limits last week.
"I would say that unless we have a significant diesel mix in Europe, within our fleet, we will miss that target, not VW, the industry will miss that [CO2] target," said Willis, referring to the EU target of an average new car emitting 95g CO2 per kilometre by 2021, compared to an average of 123.4g CO2 per km in 2014.
Transport is responsible for around a quarter of European Union greenhouse gas emissions, so moves to cut them are seen as vital to climate change efforts.
During an often heated exchange with environment, food and rural affairs committee MPs, Willis defended VW's environmental record but conceded the company had to win back consumer trust after the revelations last year that 12m of its cars were equipped with "defeat devices" to cheat NOx emissions tests.
"For almost everyone in our company to learn what we learned in September [when the scandal emerged] was very difficult for us to swallow and very difficult for us to understand. I think you heard the apologies I made at that time and I'm still really sorry for that." He said the company would redouble efforts to win back trust. 
But owners of the 1.2m VW cars in the UK affected by the diesel emissions testing scandal should not receive any compensation because they have not suffered any loss, he argued. "To pay compensation, there has to be a loss. At this stage I see no reason for there to be a loss. The adjustment of the software, our engineers are telling us, there will be no difference in in fuel consumption as a result of this fix. 
"The other area is on the question of residual values, I have seen no clear evidence there has been any adverse impact on residual values." 
                     A survey last year found that nine out of 10 VW drivers in Britain affected by the scandal believed they should receive compensation, in addition to the software fix that VW is rolling out to customers.
Asked whether consumers would begin to factor health into their purchasing decisions, Willis said that pollution emissions were not a priority for most car-buyers.
 Related:  The rise of diesel in Europe: the impact on health and pollution
"I'm sorry to tell you but look at the data and look at what customers' priorities are when they're buying vehicles, they don't talk about NOx," he said.
He said the scandal had had some effect on its sales in November and December but noted that retail orders in December 2015 were actually higher than orders in December 2014. "I think people know there was an error in the testing regime, and they understand in the real world there was no difference at all," he said.
Asked how much more NO2 had been emitted as a result of his company cheating on the tests, Willis repeated previous assertions that it was impossible to say because there is no agreed standard for "real world" emissions.
Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, sitting next to Willis, said the technology for testing real world emissions had only been available for two to three years.
Separately on Wednesday, VW's chief executive Matthias M¸ller is meeting regulators in Washington to attempt to reach agreement with US authorities on a solution for the affected cars. On Sunday he appeared to downplay the idea the company had cheated tests,  telling NPR it was simply a "technical problem" not an "ethical problem".

Former South Africa cricketer faces Ram Slam match-fixing charges; 
∑ Investigation into corruption during T20 competition nears completion ∑ South Africa braced for biggest scandal since Hansie Cronje affair.

Ali Martin in Johannesburg.

South African cricket is bracing itself for the biggest match-fixing scandal to hit the country since its former Test captain, Hansie Cronje, was banned for life in 2000, with an investigation into corruption during the recent Ram Slam Twenty20 competition understood to be close to completion. 
 Related:  Sri Lankan cricketers face inquiry after accusations of 'scandalous behaviour'
Cricket South Africa announced on 15 December last year that it had charged an "intermediary" under its anti-corruption code for "contriving to fix, or otherwise improperly influence aspects" of the tournament, as well as refusing to cooperate with its enquiries. Now a column by the respected journalist and broadcaster, Neil Manthorp, in Business Day has revealed that a legal case is being prepared against "a significant number of domestic players" with the ringleader - the "intermediary" referred to last month - known to be a former South African international cricketer.
While a number of players are set to be charged with "failure to report" approaches, the report said the ringleader is facing possible jail time for his part in the scam.
Match-fixing was made illegal in South Africa in 2004 under the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act Law, introduced four years after Cronje admitted to his role in manipulating international games. Speaking in December, Haroon Lorgat, CSA's chief executive, said: "Our attitude to corruption will always be one of zero tolerance and we are confident that we have the necessary structures in place to effectively deal with any corrupt activity.
"We will relentlessly pursue under our code and the law of the land any persons we believe to be involved in corrupting the game and, with assistance from the police, we will also seek criminal prosecution."

Sebastian Coe must resist joining The Powerfully Powerless or be damned; 
Trust in sports administration has been destroyed over the past year by elites who claim oblivion - Lord Coe must not add to this growing demographic.

Marina Hyde.

According to Sebastian Coe, last week's banning of four senior athletics officials "could not send a stronger message". Unfortunately for his lordship, the suspicion is that Wada report into alleged corruption within the IAAF will send an infinitely stronger message. Then again, arguably the last time Coe was right about something was at the moment of his obscurantist electoral triumph, when he described his since-arrested predecessor Lamine Diack as the "spiritual president" of athletics.
Still, you're always the last to know, aren't you? Back in November, Coe told the culture select committee that he had never heard the whispers about Diack "possibly being involved in corruption".

To which the only reasonable reply was: dude, how is that even possible? There are uncontacted tribes who had heard those whispers. Google Earth bits of the Amazon jungle at any point over the past few years and you'd have been able to see bones and earthenware vessels arranged into giant messages reading: "Wait - he got tens of thousands of dollars from a defunct sports marketing firm because his house burnt down?!?!?! DO ME A FAVOUR".
With that statement, Coe made a choice he must either reverse or be damned by. He promoted himself to early 21st century power's fastest growing demographic: what we might term The Powerfully Powerless. Like all sports administrators, all banking CEOs, all media bosses, and all senior coppers, he was unaware. They can't be expected to have had a clue about this stuff, much less be accountable for it. Even when they resign, they only do it to stop being a distraction from their own valuable clean-up operations.
Over the past year or so, international sports governance has become another thing in which trust has collapsed amid sensational scandal. Yet like each of the other institutions it follows - banks, parliament, the media, the Catholic church, the police - the details that emerged seemed to confirm what people outside their remuneration had in fact known for decades. Back in 2010, David Cameron attacked the media for kiboshing the 2018 World Cup bid, when any punter with the most passing knowledge of Fifa could have told the prime minister we had about as much chance of winning an ExCo vote as we had of pulling off a Jules Rimet-Eurovision accumulator. The shock of last May's Fifa arrests must have shaken the PM badly - certainly as badly as the revelation that Rupert Murdoch's lieutenants were not always impeccable.
But the pattern reaches far beyond Cameron. From one elite to another, around the world, those in charge have chosen to declare themselves clueless. Never mind spiritual presidents - governance has been ceded to the spiritual heirs of either Captain Renault or Inspector Clouseau. I leave it to you to judge which. Even if we are to place the most charitable interpretation on their blindness, we cannot escape the conclusion that lowly punters seem to see more than the elites.
We live in interesting times - usually a euphemism, and in this case very likely to be so. The question of what all this means for something ordinary people care about - sport itself - is a complicated one.
We understand how the trust in elites goes - well, those of us who don't draw cash from them do, at any rate. But we don't have a completely clear picture of what happens when the trust is gone. Some bits we can see, and they are not encouraging. We know that a sense of powerlessness against globalised forces appears to be fuelling the rise of rightwing populism. Back in 2013, meanwhile, research conducted by The Economist Intelligence Unit found a cascade of scandals such as MPs' expenses and phone hacking had led to a marked decline in political participation. Scepticism and contempt had increased; disillusion was deepened.
Two years ago the forthcoming Wada report's author Dick Pound announced he no longer watched the Tour de France; he recently expanded his list of non-events by declaring that he now doesn't bother with the International Association of Athletics Federations' championships either. It will not have escaped the International Olympic Committee that more and more bodies politic are voting against their cities bidding to host the Olympics, while the newly sacked again Fifa general secretary JÈrÙme Valcke's comment on the comparative ease of holding tournaments in jurisdictions where there is "less democracy" was a moment of hideous candour.
In fact, like all the other damaged institutions, sport governance needs far more democracy. There were common themes to the trust breakdown from bank to church that are clearly echoed in sport: power had become concentrated, transparency (if it ever existed) was eroded, secrecy was enhanced, and the concept of "taking responsibility" was effectively abandoned. The lesson - mostly untaken across the board, alas - is that elites need to become more open and less hierarchical. A few years ago, Time magazine theorised that the Federal Reserve might not have missed an $8tn housing bubble had they opened a few board seats to consumer advocates - "heck, even community organisers". And so with Fifa and the IAAF. There is not a soul alive who could argue these bodies could be worse run if they opened themselves up to influences beyond blazers, bagmen and brown-envelope merchants.
If Coe is serious about reform (and he should be, as his personal survival now depends upon it) he must ask himself what the IAAF really has against drawing upon the wisdom of greater crowds. If he declines to, we will have to continue asking why he knew less about Diack than Wikipedia.

Top 10 failed romances in fiction; 
From Sittenfeld to Soucy, Tolstoy to DH Lawrence: the love stories that end in disappointment or sadness can also be the most rewarding and haunting.

Rachel B Glaser.

As Tolstoy said: "All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." Is this true of romance too? Is a happy romance a cliche? Is a mess more familiar to us? 
 Readers are witnesses to the unseen motives, fears, and fantasies of characters. A book that switches point of view grants the reader a unique perspective of the relationships in the story, an angle the characters will never see. The reader understands what was at stake, what could have been avoided, what the other one was thinking. Readers are let in on a secret, and the secret becomes very complex.
 Related:  Top 10 kitchens in literature
These complexities of loss and romance are ones I thought about when writing Paulina & Fran. What is romance? Can you have it with a friend? Is it always linked to sex? Does it truly ever die? Or does it just shrink and hide, then glimmer from its hiding place, like glitter stuck in the slats of your floor?  
Here are 10 books I loved reading, and all contain a failed connection. I've kept my list mostly obscure (to intrigue you), and the descriptions as vague as I can, so as not to keep the plots of these worthwhile reads surprising.
                     1. I Am Elijah Thrush by James Purdy                   
This masterpiece of broken and odd love triangles involves two elderly enemies in a decades-long feud, an amateur memoirist, a flesh-eating animal, and a small boy who speaks in bird sounds. Each character has their own unusual, impossible passion. Purdy's heartbreaking and scandalous tale begins with my favourite first line of any book: "Millicent De Frayne, who was young in 1913, the sole possessor of an immense oil fortune, languished of an incurable ailment, her wilful, hopeless love for Elijah Thrush, 'the mime, poet, painter of art nouveau', who, after ruining the lives of countless men and women, was finally himself in love, 'incorrectly, if not indecently', with his great-grandson." Though this story is very amusing, the characters are in an almost constant state of wanting. They have much anxiety, pain, and sorrow over their love. Love is a cruel torture in this book. Moments of joy, surprise, accomplishment, and friendship, ease the mood but do not erase the pain.
                     2. Prep by Curtis Sittenfeld                   
Young love strikes two prep school students in such a real-feeling and exciting way, I read straight through a whole weekend until the inevitable turn. This skilfully told portrayal of first heartbreak made me empathise, agonise and occasionally admonish the painfully self-conscious protagonist, Lee. Painful moments of misunderstanding during Lee's parents' visit to the prep school where this story takes place made me cry, and other moments of inaction made me wish it were a choose-your-own adventure story, so I could guide Lee around. 
                     3. Women in Love by DH Lawrence                   
This brilliant, thorough novel chronicles multiple romances from multiple viewpoints. Some flourish while others find cruel and violent ends. Lawrence writes from inside the relationships, voicing the duelling minds and conflicting thoughts, exposing the emotional dance at the heart of every romance. Written in 1920, parts of this book feel very modern to me - Gudrun's fashion and some of the dialogue ("dunno"). In a book of this scope, there is room to explore everything, and DH takes his time describing a mining company, a dying father, a jealous girlfriend, a drowning child, a bleeding horse, an intellectual sculptor, a precocious child, a pregnant flirt, and countless others. My favourite scene is one that flashes between love and anger on a dirt road after a bad drive. 
                     4. Desperate Characters by Paula Fox                   
This witty, exquisitely written story of daily life in 1970s Brooklyn is filled with vivid characters and examines the somewhat troubled and unsatisfying relationship of a married, childless couple. One of my favourite parts is the backstory of an affair between the main character and a publisher of plant books. A cat scratches the protagonist early on in the story and the suspense will make you late for your appointments. Paula Fox's writing reminds me of Joy Williams and Flannery O'Connor. Her world is nuanced and unforgiving. Fox talks about people and ideas, fluently, gracefully, culling deep meaning from the everyday.
                     5. The Little Girl Who Was Too Fond of Matches by GaÈtan Soucy                   
All is tragic in this insane and powerful novel translated from the French about eccentric, unsocialised children living in the aftermath of their father's death. Love is so fleeting in this violently surprising story that one puts the book down in defeat, sighs, then must continue on, like the hero. I read the book in its entirety on a flight back from Spain, and on finishing it, was so awed and struck that I flipped to the beginning and started again.
                     6. The First Bad Man by Miranda July                   
Unlikely pairings are the most exciting. July is a master of the limitless ways two people can connect. Witness a relationship shift and mutate in this freewheeling, hilarious adventure of the heart. A must-read for anyone who loved July's hilarious debut collection No One Belongs Here More Than You, or any numb reader in need of some laughter or wonder.

                     7. Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy                   
The ultimate book of tragic love: a married woman falls for a young officer and their troubled passion turns pages like the book's on fire. This classic has three or four main threads, and like the DH, really captures life in a distant time and place. I admittedly skimmed some of the passages on farming to get back to these helpless love junkies, whose doomed relationship is startlingly well-written. At one point, Tolstoy so perfectly describes a young woman feeling pretty, I concluded he, too, was once a young woman.
                     8. Lucinella by Lore Segal                   
This meta-novella is a love letter to writing. Early on, the protagonist, Lucinella, meets a poet, but finds him lacking: "What I cannot forgive is the meagerness of the back of William's neck." My favourite aspect of this book is that Segal creates older and younger versions of Lucinella and puts them in scenes with Lucinella. So Lucinella must watch William flirt with young Lucinella, and Lucinella must see her future observing old Lucinella. Segal's wild narration explores disappointment and ambivalence in love in frank, charming, and innovative ways, such as Lucinella watching her ex mourn her from the grave.
                      9. After Claude by Iris Owens                   
The protagonist of this hilarious and bizarre book is hating on Claude and his "dark, intense frog eyes" from page one, yet their interactions continue. She declares: "I am essentially a lighthearted person who tries to see the humour in the freak show called life." Follow her unusual endeavours that lead her into a stranger's apartment. This book runs on frustration, insults and weirdly beautiful lines that creep by when you least expect them. 
                     10. Bad Sex by Clancy Martin                   
This dark novella drags the reader through a whirlwind of infatuation, sacrifice, lying, lusting, drinking, crying and nearly dying. In the opening chapter, Brett sleeps with her husband's banker and her life is never the same. The dialogue and details are so real, at times it felt like a scandalous email from a troubled friend. The sentences are sparse. Not a word out of place. See the tropics and feel the feelings, vicariously, without the hangover.

Paulina & Fran by Rachel B Glaser is published by Granta Books, priced £12.99. It is available from the Guardian bookshop for £10.39, with free p&p.

Why journalists should challenge the new surveillance powers; 
Chakrabati and Brooke say investigatory powers bill gives the state 'a blank cheque' to spy on citizens and threatens investigative journalism.

Roy Greenslade.

Journalists should challenge the surveillance powers contained in the government's draft investigatory powers legislation, argued two speakers at a panel debate on Monday.
Shami Chakrabati, the director of Liberty, and Heather Brooke, the journalist who exposed the MPs' expenses scandal, believe the bill - drawn up largely to combat terrorism - will give the state "a blank cheque" to spy on citizens and also presents a very real threat to investigative journalism.
Chakrabati and Brooke were taking part in an event, Press freedom in a surveillance state, organised by the London Press Club and the Society of Editors at London's Stationers' Hall.  
According to Chakrabati - once dubbed by the Sun as "the most dangerous woman in Britain" - if the investigatory powers bill is enacted it will "turn all of us into suspects." 
She called for "an appropriate balance between liberty and security. But since 9/11 to be somebody even calling for a more proportionate approach is to be a traitor."
She praised Edward Snowden for his revelations, saying: "We wouldn't be capable of having this debate but for his intervention."
Challenged on the need for surveillance as protection from terrorism, she said that while the police always had the power search homes and tap phones, what we face "without public debate or knowledge or consent or with parliamentary involvement, let alone the involvement of the judiciary" is "blanket surveillance."
And this surveillance is not about the targeting of those who have aroused suspicion "but something which would turn all of us into suspects." She implored journalists to oppose it. 
She said: "If everyone is suspect and all communications are to be captured and retained, looked at or not, how do you protect journalists' sources, how do you protect parliamentarians, how do you medical confidentiality or legal confidentiality? You can't."
Brooke also warned against a "no privacy for us, no scrutiny of them" attitude, especially in view of the government's current attempts to curtail freedom of information requests.
Now a professor at City University London, she served on the Independent Surveillance Review Panel alongside the former MI6 chief, John Scarlett (who argued in the Times on Monday that our way of life depends "more than ever" on "effective intelligence work").
Brooke said: "It's not that if you have nothing to fear, you have nothing to hide. But if you are doing certain types of journalism, by definition you are pissing off powerful people - people with money and power - and you might be considered subversive to the state. 
"For example, the stuff that's been exposed about the police (infiltrating pressure groups) you are challenging the police, they don't like it so, under their Ripa powers, they have made life difficult for journalists. And that's the problem. 
"When you give to the state this gigantic storehouse of all of your internet and telecommunications data, the minute you come on their radar as a person of interest, they have a litmus test maybe not to arrest you, but maybe to blackmail you, to put pressure on you, to do things than may stop you doing certain stories and may curtail your investigation."
Fellow panellist Martin Bentham, the London Evening Standard's home affairs editor, was less pessimistic. He believe Chakrabati and Brooke had "valid arguments... about the need for proper safeguards and proper monitoring" but did not "accept we are going to be living in some sort of East German state with everybody under surveillance." 
What had emerged post-Snowden, he said, was the extent of activities by the security services that even the regulators were unaware of, and in particular how journalists sources could be compromised. 
"The question now is whether the new investigatory powers proposals will provide proper safeguards, and I am relatively optimistic that with judicial oversight, for example, on warrants on journalists, we will achieve something."

This cover-up of sex assaults in Sweden is a gift for xenophobes; 
Police failure to report widespread assaults by immigrant gangs at a Stockholm music festival will be immensely damaging for the country's race relations.

Andrew Brown.

The news that the Swedish authorities covered up widespread sexual assaults by immigrant gangs on teenage girls at a Stockholm music festival, and possibly other incidents too, is immensely damaging for race relations in Sweden because it conforms so precisely to two stereotypes.
The first, widely believed in nationalist circles, is that immigrants to Sweden are responsible for the huge rise in reported rapes in recent years. The second, more true, and much more widely believed, is that you cannot trust respectable Swedish opinion to be honest about the bad effects of immigration. 
It has been quite clearly established that there has been an increase in violent crime, and in reported rape, over the last 40 years in Sweden. In 1995, the first year for which statistics are easily available on the Crime Agency's website, there were 179 murders in Sweden, of which 29 involved guns; in 2014 there were 317, of which 74 involved guns.
Some of the violence is closely linked to the appearance of gangs of Balkan and Middle Eastern origin among refugee groupings who fight for control of the drugs trade, among other things. There were around 40 unsolved gang murders on police files at the end of last year.
 Related:  Swedish police accused of covering up sex attacks by refugees at music festival
Rape statistics are harder to judge. The raw figures suggest a huge rise in reports, from 1,707 in 1995 to 6,697 in 2014. But, as the Julian Assange case showed, there is perhaps less stigma about reporting the crime than elsewhere, and the Swedish legal definition of rape is wider than in other countries. In any case, the police do not record the ethnicity of either criminals or victims, and the press is extremely constrained over reporting identifying details about either the victims or the perpetrators of crimes.
So it is impossible either to prove or to disprove, from official statistics, the nationalist claim that the rapists are disproportionately young male migrants. Yet that claim is repeated as a fact in racist and xenophobic parts of the internet. What is certain is that you would hardly ever find it mentioned, even to refute, in the reputable Swedish media - until last week.
This is the really damaging effect of the Stockholm scandal - and it is worth noting that only one of the reported assaults at the festival was classed as rape: most were mob gropings, which are still terrifying and criminal violations.
The Swedish political and media establishment decided to deal with the threat of a nationalist and xenophobic party,  the Sweden Democrats, by ignoring them and hoping they would go away. This policy was fuelled partly by wishful thinking, partly by principle and partly by self-righteousness. It ended disastrously.
The Sweden Democrats broke into parliament in 2010 and now hold the balance of power there, although all of the other parties have combined to vote so as to neutralise them. The result of that, again predictably, has been that their support has risen to unprecedented levels - 20% in the last poll I saw. The recent clampdown on immigration can only strengthen them further.
The Social Democrats, and their newspaper, Aftonbladet, appear to have been particularly keen on the posture of suppression and denial, because the great majority of the Sweden Democrats' voters had been Social Democrats, rather than traditional rightwingers.
It is absolutely clear - with the publication of internal memos by the newspaper Dagens Nyheter - that the Stockholm police failed to report the sex assaults at the festival for fear of worsening ethnic tensions. And it was understood by all parties that this would lead to an electoral advantage for the Sweden Democrats.
The organisers, who also allegedly knew what was going on, were concerned for the success of the festival and did not want to frighten away the teenagers who were its target audience.
So teenage girls were systematically assaulted and robbed by gangs of young foreign men because too many powerful people found their suffering was inconvenient. The result of this cover-up will be far more damaging than the truth could have been.

In fact, like all the other damaged institutions, sport governance needs far more democracy. There were common themes to the trust breakdown from bank to church that are clearly echoed in sport: power had become concentrated, transparency (if it ever existed) was eroded, secrecy was enhanced, and the concept of "taking responsibility" was effectively abandoned. The lesson - mostly untaken across the board, alas - is that elites need to become more open and less hierarchical. A few years ago, Time magazine theorised that the Federal Reserve might not have missed an $8tn housing bubble had they opened a few board seats to consumer advocates - "heck, even community organisers". And so with Fifa and the IAAF. There is not a soul alive who could argue these bodies could be worse run if they opened themselves up to influences beyond blazers, bagmen and brown-envelope merchants.
If Coe is serious about reform (and he should be, as his personal survival now depends upon it) he must ask himself what the IAAF really has against drawing upon the wisdom of greater crowds. If he declines to, we will have to continue asking why he knew less about Diack than Wikipedia.

Air pollution: UK environment ministers face court action within weeks; 
Law firm ClientEarth says it will seek urgent court action because of the risk to people's lives from dangerous emissions.

John Vidal.

UK environment ministers will be taken to court within weeks to make them speed up plans to reduce dangerous urban air pollution. 
Law firm ClientEarth, which last year forced the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to come up with fresh plans to tackle illegal NO2 levels in British cities, warned that it would seek urgent court action because thousands of people's lives were at risk if present government plans were not strengthened. 
Under new plans revealed before Christmas, Defra promised clean air zones for five cities by 2020 in addition to one already planned for London. But it will still take at least five years to clean up pollution in many cities, including Manchester, Cardiff and Edinburgh. 
"The government seem to think that the health of people in cities like Glasgow, Manchester and Bristol is less important than that of people in London. While London gets a clean air zone covering all vehicles, Birmingham gets a second-class zone and Derby and Southampton third-class, while other areas including Manchester and Liverpool are left out. We all have the same right to breathe clean air," said Alan Andrews of ClientEarth.

Andrews said that ClientEarth would go to the high court by 17 March and would ask for the case to be fast-tracked because people's lives were at risk. Nearly 6,000 people die prematurely each year in London alone because of NO2, according to one study.
"They [the government] have had since 2011. We are looking for a hearing this year, hopefully before the summer. This is such an urgent issue.
"The supreme court ordered government to take immediate action. These plans are an outrageous statement... that the government doesn't intend to comply as soon as possible. It is an arrogant response that is simply not good enough," he said.
In an article for the Guardian on Wednesday, barrister Justine Thornton, the wife of former Labour party leader Ed Miliband, says air pollution is a political scandal which the courts should resolve.
"The government is still putting short-term political priorities ahead of public health and people's lives. The revised air pollution plan soft pedals on pollution by private motorists while the government appears intent on watering down European legal limits for vehicle emissions. 
"The stage is set for a fascinating tussle between law and politics. The UK court will have to roll up its sleeves and decide whether this government is doing what it can to make our air as safe as possible," wrote Thornton, who will next month formally become a QC. 
"Ten more years of dangerous air pollution in London puts a whole generation of children at risk. The quality of the air that our children breathe is too important to be decided behind closed doors by government and vehicle manufacturers," she wrote. 
NO2 pollution limits for the whole year were breached in Putney high street and Knightsbridge last week. These state that maximum hourly nitrogen dioxide concentrations are not exceeded for more than 18 hours a year.

Does child protection need a rethink?; 
The review of local safeguarding children boards is an opportunity to improve accountability of schools, social care and police.

David N Jones and Maggie Blyth.

Buried in the prime minister's December announcement about improving children's services was a review of Local Safeguarding Children Boards (LSCBs), which coordinate child protection in England. This is the first stocktake of these arrangements since the battered baby syndrome guidance was first issued in 1970. This review, undertaken by former director of children's services, Alan Wood is hugely significant, with enormous implications for the protection of children.
In response to this review, the Association of Independent LSCB Chairs - those who lead the local boards - has convened a roundtable to analyse safeguarding challenges and explore options for improvement. This debate has to extend beyond local politicians and professionals. How do we both support families and ensure that children are protected? 
 Related:  Child protection cases have rocketed - Cameron's only answer is privatisation
Since 1970 we have seen a string of tragic cases ; some have stirred strong emotions and resulted in changes in the law. The public, politicians and media react strongly to cases of abuse but are also quick to condemn the breakup of families without good reason. 
This review is happening as awareness of abuse and problems of parenting is increasing. The prime minister upgraded child sexual abuse to a "national threat" in March 2015 and created a cabinet taskforce in June. Adults disclosing historic child sexual abuse, the scandals surrounding child sexual exploitation cases and the significant increase in the number of new abuse cases could indicate child protection is facing a crisis. The numbers of children on child protection plans and investigations into child sexual abuse are higher than ever before. Serious case reviews tend to highlight problems of poor communication in working together to protect children. 
Is this review a response to a service needing overhaul? Or is it about improved understanding of child welfare, effective work to protect children and a renewed commitment to put the protection of children at the heart of public services? 
Contrary to what is too often reported, England and Wales have one of the safest child protection systems in the world. The number of children who die as a result of maltreatment has not increased over the last thirty years. Social workers, teachers, health visitors and police officers often successfully intervene to make children's lives better. There are many examples of agencies working together to tackle exploitation, make communities safer and protect children. 
Nonetheless, there are three reasons why this review is so important. 
The legislation that created LSCBs is now over 10 years old and requires updating. These boards were set up primarily to coordinate the multi-agency partnership and ensure its effectiveness. There is a strong case for giving the LSCB, or whatever replaces it, a clear mandate to hold local organisations to account for the quality of services and for enhancing the scrutiny role already inherent in legislation, but not always used. Are new tools or powers needed to make this possible?
Secondly, we need better ways to change ineffective local partnerships. There are many strong child protection arrangements around the country; over 20 LSCBs have recently been graded good by Ofsted. Improving the lives of children can only be achieved by all agencies working closely together. The local child protection partnership remains essential but there are opportunities to establish wider regional structures to hold local arrangements to account. Functions such as policies and procedures and staff training could be undertaken more cost-effectively on a regional basis, as is being explored in the West Midlands.

And thirdly, LSCBs are a partnership between local agencies, with an independent chair to support them to hold each other to account. Experience demonstrates the importance of local challenge and learning, but the role of independence could be strengthened. The independent commissioners appointed in a few poorly performing local authority areas could provide a model for greater independent accountability and oversight of child protection as part of an improvement agenda.
Child protection depends on effective working between schools, health, police and social care. It is essential this review ensures all these agencies cooperate in safeguarding children and are jointly held to account. When children are not adequately protected, we need quicker remedies. This framework requires legal backing; to remove the statutory requirements would expose children to harm and set back the improvements of the last decade.
LSCBs are the body tasked with oversight of all these agencies. We have the opportunity to use the accountability and scrutiny functions to properly hold the organisations and their leaders to account, to ensure improvement where it is needed and to keep the child protection partnership working well. This review offers a potential step change in making sure all professionals put the protection of children first.

Bidding process for 2020 Tokyo Olympics dragged into IAAF scandal; 
∑ Wada investigation reveals money may have influenced Lamine Diack's vote ∑ Diack switched support from Istanbul to Tokyo after sponsorship payment.

Owen Gibson.

The bidding process for the 2020 Olympics has been dragged into the IAAF scandal after Dick Pound's Wada investigation revealed that $5m of sponsorship money may have been a factor in swaying Lamine Diack's vote. 
 Related:  Inside the IAAF: who knew what and when
Pound's independent commission examined transcripts that showed Diack dropped his support for Istanbul and switched to Tokyo after the Japanese city agreed to pay the sponsorship cash.
The commission also uncovered evidence that senior IAAF officials benefited personally from the decisions to award athletics' world championships.
The commission's report cites transcripts of conversations between Diack's son Khalil and Turkish officials in relation to the 2020 Olympics.
It states: "Transcripts of the various discussions between Turkish individuals with KD [Khalil Diack] make reference to a discussion regarding the Olympic city bidding process for the 2020 Summer Olympic Games.
"It is stated that Turkey lost LD's [Lamine Diack's] support because they did not pay sponsorship moneys of $4m-$5m either to the Diamond League or IAAF. According to the transcript the Japanese did pay such a sum.
" The 2020 Games were awarded to Tokyo. The IC did not investigate this matter further for it was not within our remit."
It is believed the sponsorship deal in question involved the Japanese electronics giant Canon, which was a Tokyo 2020 gold partner and signed a multi-year deal with the IAAF 10 months out from the Olympics vote in Buenos Aires.

Dick Pound held Sebastian Coe's IAAF career at his mercy - and let him live; 
A week that started with Sebastian Coe on the ropes ended with him being revived as Dick Pound backed him to lead reform at the IAAF.

Sean Ingle.

When the killer question came, Dick Pound gently rocked on his seat and took a discreet breath. "Given what you have said about the IAAF council, and that it must have known what was going on in Russia, do you believe Lord Coe's position remains tenable?" he was asked.
 Related:  Sebastian Coe admits IAAF is 'a failed organisation' after new Wada report 
There was a deliberate pause. Everyone knew Sebastian Coe's tender career as the head of global athletics was at his mercy. A few damning words would have pulverised it. Instead Pound, that ice-veined investigator of Russia's sporting corruption only two months ago, put a warm protective cloak around the IAAF president. And so a week that started with Coe on the ropes ended with him receiving an unexpected dose of smelling salts.
"I think it's a fabulous opportunity for the IAAF to seize this opportunity and under strong leadership to move forward," explained Pound, whose former role as an outspoken head of the World Anti-Doping Agency gives his words more credibility than most. "There is an enormous amount of reputational recovery that has to occur here but I can't think of anyone better than Lord Coe to lead that."
You could almost hear the sound of jaws plummeting through the floor of the Dolce Munich Hotel and into the basement. Understandably so. In the few minutes between Pound's independent commission report being released and the press conference, those scanning the executive summary had noted it was severely critical of the IAAF's response to the Russian doping scandal. Indirectly, Coe was in the firing line given the report insisted that "the IAAF council could not have been unaware of the extent of doping in athletics and the non-enforcement of applicable anti-doping rules". Coe had sat on that very council since 2003.
Yet Pound was able to perform a curious juggling act, on the one hand lambasting the IAAF under Coe for being "in denial" about the extent of their troubles while also putting his faith in the new man to fix them. So in one breath he would say: "The IAAF displays no genuine appetite to deal with the problems" yet in the next he backed Coe to rise to the challenge of clearing up its mess, because "you learn from experience".
When it was put to Pound that Coe's IAAF had not moved fast enough to change, he concurred, saying: "Of course there was cover-up and delay. Acknowledge this. If you can't acknowledge it you are never going to get past it." Yet when asked whether Coe should have been more aware of Russian doping, the IAAF president was given a pass. "I don't want to lay the failures of an entire council at the feet of one individual," said Pound, who later insisted: "My sense is if Lord Coe knew about corruption he would have said something about it."
Pound's words were chosen with lawyerly care, by someone with decades of experience in international sports politics. He knew what he was saying. It appeared Coe was being given his blessing to continue as president - while at the same time being warned to step up his act. As Pound put it: "Continued denial will simply make it more difficult to make genuine progress."
Two other points are worth stressing. First, while the media's questions to Pound were predominately about Coe he is mentioned only twice in the entire 95-page report. Once in an email from his former right-hand man Nick Davies, who stepped down from the IAAF in December, and then in a footnote quoting a Guardian story. Yet even though the report does not address Coe's role - and presumably did not thoroughly investigate what he knew or when - Pound still offered Coe staunch backing. Perhaps he considered the lack of alternatives.
The second is that Coe and the IAAF still face a long and bumpy ride. French prosecutors may yet have their day in court with the now disgraced members of athletics' governing body. Coe's close friend Davies, meanwhile, was the subject of a particularly damning section of the independent commission report. Davies had claimed an email to the IAAF's former marketing executive Papa Massata Diack suggesting they delay the announcement of Russian doping bans around the 2013 world championships in Moscow was "brainstorming".
But Pound strongly disagreed, saying that Davies knew about "Russian skeletons in the cupboard". And he was not just brainstorming: "Instead, it was a comprehensive and considered plan proposed by the IAAF deputy secretary general and communications director to a member of the IAAF president's inner circle."
 Related:  Inside the IAAF: who knew what and when
Yet given the scrutiny and pressure Coe has faced since becoming the IAAF's president in August he will leave Munich with a spring in his step. Perhaps he had an inkling the day would turn out fine. Certainly the casual way he listened to Pound from the back of the conference room, often fiddling with his glasses or muttering a quiet word to his loyal lieutenant Jackie Brock-Doyle, suggested as much. "The IAAF still has an enormous task ahead of it to restore public confidence," he said afterwards. "We cannot change the past but I am determined that we will learn from it and will not repeat its mistakes."
They were the right words, but words are no longer enough. As the Pound report makes clear, the sport's deep problems will not be magicked away - especially given the twin contagions of doping and corruption have spread far beyond Russia. While Coe has started to make some welcome structural reforms to track and field's governing body, its overly defensive and closed culture does not yet appear much different. A sceptical public will want more before relaxing their gaze. For now Coe and the IAAF remain on notice.

It may be good news for Renault but investors will continue to fret; 
In the wake of the emissions cheating scandal at Volkswagen, the mere whiff of anything odd can choke share prices.

Nils Pratley.

A fuss about nothing? Renault thinks so. It says it is "good news for Renault" that investigators have not found Volkswagen-style cheat devices during emissions tests on company's cars. So how come Renault's share price recovered only half the 20% fall that followed reports that anti-fraud investigators had raided three of the carmaker's plants?
One answer: the corporate statement wasn't quite a definitive boast that everything is trËs jolie under the bonnet. Renault could, for example, have said its board is completely confident that investigators will find nothing because there is nothing to find. Instead, there was a curious sentence about how the "on-going tests open the way for improvement solutions for future and current Renault vehicles". Solutions to which problem? 
At least SÈgolËne Royal, France's energy and ecology minister, seemed to leave no room for ambiguity. "There is no fraud at Renault," she said. "Shareholders and employees should be reassured." Maybe they will be. Maybe the (EURO)2.5bn wiped off Renault's stock market value on Thursday will be wiped on again.
It remains a safe bet, however, that investors will continue to fret about what fresh horrors will be revealed from the global car industry. Outsiders know two facts that may be relevant. First, this is an industry where expertise is sometimes shared to trim research budgets. Second, the top crew at Volkswagen say they didn't know a thing about the cheating software and, if utter ignorance was the true position, managements elsewhere may also be in the dark.
Renault, to be clear, may be a model of corporate virtue on emissions - judgment will have to await the investigators' findings. But, as an industry, carmakers seem to have devoted more resources to working out how to pass emissions tests, rather than exploring ways to reduce noxious emissions themselves. No wonder the industry and its regulators aren't trusted. After the Volkswagen scandal, share prices can choke on the mere whiff of anything odd.

Tesco's unanswered questions
As shoppers flock back to Tesco, investors don't. OK, the shares rose 6% on Thursday as trade at Christmas beat the City's gloomy expectations. But, at 168p, the share price is roughly where it was soon after chief executive Dave Lewis arrived in autumn 2014. By contrast, this time last year, the shares were heading towards 240p as the market thought it sensed a rapid bounceback.
One half-decent Christmas will raise spirits, but, over the past year, shareholders have had to recognise how long it will take to improve Tesco's financial fortunes. Lewis listed several admirable qualities behind the strong(ish) Christmas - sharper prices, better customer service and fewer empty shelves - but none of those improvements are free from the retailer's point of view.
Note the important line in the statement: Tesco is trading "in line" with profit expectations for the financial year of £930m at the operating level. Translation: any trading gains will be "invested", as retailers misleadingly put it, for the benefit of customers rather than directed towards shareholders.
That is a correct order of priorities since it was obvious to everybody that Tesco needed to regain its competitive edge. But the big question for investors - what level of profit margin can be achieved while being competitive? - remains unanswered. Tesco used to run on 5% until the customers decided they were being ripped off. Last year the figure was 1%. In the new world, 2% or 3% should be possible, but the difference between the two is wide in profit terms when your UK turnover is £48bn.
Signs of stability reduce the risk of a rights issue to reinforce Tesco's balance sheet, but that danger was probably passing anyway. Real progress, for shareholders as opposed to customers, will come only when Lewis starts talking about restoring the dividend at a decent level. That moment still feels some way off.

FCA needs personality transplant
"Recent interventions by HM Treasury and other bodies have raised questions from directors regarding the board's independence." So says the Financial Conduct Authority in a report on the effectiveness of its board. You can understand why the directors are puzzled about what it means to be an independent regulator. It was George Osborne, not them, who last year ousted the last FCA chief executive, Martin Wheatley.
The chancellor was within his rights, it should be said - his powers of intervention are part of what the FCA coyly calls "a complex and demanding stakeholder landscape." But the episode underlined how, under the UK's "twin peaks" model of financial regulation, the Bank of England towers over the FCA. The Bank will always be the senior posting, but the FCA badly needs its next boss to be a big personality.

Inside the IAAF: who knew what and when; 
Senior figures inside the IAAF, such as Lamine Diack, have been implicated in the Russian blood-doping scandal which dates back at least to 2009.

Sean Ingle.

Lamine Diack
                     IAAF president 1999-2015                   
Accused by Wada's independent commission of "deliberately inserting" Habib CissÈ into the IAAF's anti-doping department in November 2011 to manipulate Russian athlete biological passport cases, although likely to have known about Russian doping before then. Last month Diack reported to have told French police that he sought £1m in bribes from Valentin Balakhnichev, the IAAF treasurer and president of Russia's athletics federation, to cover up doping in 2011. Balakhnichev denies the claim.

Nick Davies
                     Deputy general secretary                     
                     August-December 2014                   
Leaked emails from July 2013 showed when Davies was IAAF director of communications he discussed managing the release of Russian bans to avoid negative publicity around the 2013 world championships. Was also told about the extortion of Liliya Shobukhova in February 2013 by the IAAF whistleblower Sean Wallace-Jones. Stepped down voluntarily while IAAF ethics committee reviewed his case. Pound's report claimed he was "well aware of Russian skeletons in the cupboard".

Habib CissÈ
                     Legal adviser to President Diack 2003-14                   
Was allegedly inserted into the IAAF anti-doping department by Diack to disrupt and corrupt its anti-doping work in November 2011. CissÈ was put in charge of Russian athlete biological passport cases, a move the IAAF anti-doping manager Thomas Capdevielle called "unusual and inappropriate".

Pierre Weiss
                     IAAF general secretary 2006-11                   
Knew of widespread Russian doping by October 2009, when he sent a letter to Balakhnichev warning: "This matter of the Russian athletes' blood levels is now so serious... that immediate and drastic action is needed." As he explained, Russian test results at the 2009 world championships "strongly suggest a systematic abuse of blood doping or EPO-related products".

Essar Gabriel
                     IAAF general secretary 2011-15                   
Unclear what he knew, if anything, about Russian doping. Only mentioned in passing in the recent IAAF ethics commission report.

Gabriel DollÈ
                     Director of the IAAF's medical and anti-doping department                    
                     2001-13                   
Given his role, it's likely he would have known about the extent of the Russian blood passport problems from 2009, but from 2011 "actively corrupted departmental operations" according to Wada.

Sebastian Coe
                     IAAF president 2015-present                   
Coe insists that while he was generally aware of the problems with Russia and doping from the time he competed onwards, he had no knowledge of any specific corruption within the IAAF or Russian athletics despite working for the IAAF since 2003.

Thomas Capdevielle
                     IAAF anti-doping manager                   
                     2004-present                   
Knew of problems with Russian athletes at least as early as 3 November 2011, when, according to the IAAF ethics committee report, he was asked by DollÈ, "to prepare and send a note to CissÈ summarising the status of the numerous ABP Russian cases, then under proceedings or under investigations". Praised by Pound for trying to do the right thing.

Huw Roberts
                     Senior counsel August 2015-present                    
Roberts told the IAAF's ethics commission that he first became aware of Shobukhova's extreme blood profile towards the end of 2012 and resigned from the IAAF a few months later after repeatedly confronting Diack over the failure to sanction Russian athletes. Praised by Pound for trying to counteract corruption in organisation.

Papa Massata Diack
                     IAAF marketing executive                    
                     2000-14                   
Allegedly a key figure in the corruption of the anti-doping unit from 2011 onwards, along with CissÈ and DollÈ, and banned for life for his supposed part in the extortion of Shobukhova by the IAAF ethics commission early this month. Currently in Senegal; an Interpol warrant for his arrest on alleged corruption and money laundering charges has been issued.

Sergey Bubka
                     Senior IAAF vice-president 2007-present                   
Unclear what he knew, if anything, about what was going on in Russia. In December 2015 he said he was "deeply shocked" by claims of systematic doping in Russian athletics.

Valentin Balakhnichev
                     IAAF treasurer 2011-15 Head of Russian athletics 1991-2015                   
Banned for life by the IAAF ethics commission last week for allegedly extorting money from Shobukhova in conjunction with Papa Massata Diack and CissÈ.

French government reassures Renault investors there is 'no emissions fraud'; 
Almost (EURO)5bn was wiped off carmaker's market value in early trading after news of police raids at carmaker's premises.

Gwyn Topham Transport correspondent and Julia Kollewe.

French ministers have said that no "defeat device" or fraudulent software in Renault engines has been found, after the carmaker's share price plunged on Thursday following reports that police had raided its premises. 
Shares in Renault tumbled more than 20% on Thursday morning as investors feared that the French manufacturer could be drawn into the VW diesel emissions scandal, after unions revealed that fraud investigators had searched three sites the previous week. Shares rallied to leave Renault down around 10% by the end of the day. 
Renault confirmed the raids had taken place but denied that any evidence of defeat devices had been discovered, before France's ecology and energy minister, SÈgolËne Royal, moved to calm speculation.  
Royal said that the French independent technical commission set up in the wake of the VW scandal, which presented its results to the minister in a meeting on Thursday, had found nothing wrong in Renault's cars. She told journalists: "There is no fraud at Renault. Shareholders and employees should be reassured." 
However, Royal confirmed that Renault cars did emit carbon dioxide (CO 2) and nitrogen oxide (NO x) emissions above accepted limits in their tests. Renault pledged in late 2015 that it would invest (EURO)50m (£38m) to bring its cars' real-world emissions into line with those recorded under official test conditions. 
As news of last week's police raid emerged, Renault's shares fell sharply, wiping (EURO)5bn (£3.7bn) off the company's market value and depressing European markets. Already down around 2% on the back of lower oil prices, the French stock market, CAC, and its German counterpart, the DAX, extended their losses to more than 3% after the Renault reports. 
A second French politician, economy minister Emmanuel Macron, played down the raids as "normal" checks, adding that no stigma was attached to Renault. The company said investigators had decided to carry out additional checks on parts and factories to look at the way it uses exhaust emissions technology, following an earlier investigation by the French government. 
The CGT union said that investigators took the personal computers of several Renault directors. A union official, Florent Grimaldi, told Reuters: "There were searches at several Renault sites by fraud investigators. Management has not confirmed that it is about NOx emissions but given the sectors that were inspected we think that it could be linked."
Shares in other carmakers also fell, with Peugeot down 5% even though the company said emissions tests carried out by the French energy ministry on its cars showed no anomalies and that it had not been subject to searches by fraud investigators. In Frankfurt, Daimler, BMW and Volkswagen also fell sharply alongside Renault, although they recovered much of their losses during later trading. 
Volkswagen's rivals have been drawn into the fallout from the scandal after increased focus on the real level of emissions from engines, which have been far higher in most vehicles than official test results show, even without the kind of cheat devices used at VW. Volkswagen is still facing fines that could potentially run into tens of billions of dollars in the US since it admitted rigging emissions tests for a range of its diesel vehicles. 
The Environmental Protection Agency and VW are still in talks over remedies for around 500,000 affected diesel cars in the US, after Californian regulators rejected VW's plans for a recall earlier this week.

VW's chief executive, Matthias M¸ller, suggested fitting a catalytic converter could address the problem on most vehicles, though German press reports have suggested more than 100,000 cars would need to be bought back. In the meantime, VW has pledged at least $1,000 worth of compensation to American owners. 
However, VW's UK managing director has said there will be no compensation paid to British motorists, where 1.2m cars are affected. In a letter to the Commons transport select committee, Paul Willis said that VW did "not believe it was necessary" to compensate owners and that only "goodwill payments" tailored to different countries were being considered by the manufacturer. 
Consumer groups in Britain called on the government to introduce tougher measures. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: "Volkswagen customers will be angry at this news and simply will not understand why US consumers are getting a goodwill payment and they're not. British consumers deserve to be treated fairly. We urge Volkswagen to reconsider its position." 
VW disputes that the software installed in its affected diesel cars constitutes a "defeat device" in the EU, although it has accepted that the same software constitutes a defeat device in the US, under a "different regulatory framework". MPs said they would be recalling Willis for further questioning by the committee.

The Guardian view on the relief of Madaya: at last, they can eat. Thousands more still starve; 
One day peace will come. And then the Assad regime and its allies must be held to account by the international community.

Editorial.

These were harrowing images, ones that bring to mind horrors seen during the second world war. Emaciated children, bones visible beneath their skin, their feeble voices begging for food. The skeletal body of a man who starved to death. The stories behind these images were no less heart-wrenching: families reduced to eating grass and leaves, parents eating nothing at all so their children might survive. 
These were not scenes from a medieval history book, nor from a country stricken by natural disaster, but from today's Syria, a country where the list of atrocities inflicted on civilians seems to have no end. The plight of Madaya - just an hour from Damascus - a town of 30,000 besieged since July last year, was suddenly brought to the world's attention by Syrian activists and opposition networks who resorted to spreading photos and videos online. They did well: a first convoy of United Nations aid finally arrived earlier this week. A second one got through on Thursday. UN officials and international aid workers found at least 400 inhabitants in a critical state of undernourishment. According to MÈdecins Sans FrontiËres, at least 28 people, including six babies, had succumbed to famine.
The age-old strategy of siege is back. The Syrian regime, aided by Iranian-controlled foot soldiers, had chosen this method to retake charge of key routes connecting Damascus to the Lebanese border and coastal areas. It was a policy of starve-or-surrender, in a blatant violation of international humanitarian law. That this crime - which must now be thoroughly documented by the UN commission investigating atrocities in Syria - even happened is terrible. That it took so long for public opinion and international actors to become aware of it adds to the scandal. This was both a humanitarian blockade and a media blockade, typical of the Assad regime, where journalists are routinely kidnapped. Without the international outrage, it is hard to judge when a reluctant Syrian government would have lifted the siege of the rebel-held town.
But it would be short-sighted to see this as a definitive or even a sufficient outcome. Indeed, both the Assad regime and its Hezbollah allies have claimed to have had nothing to do with the starvation. Nor is it any less worrying that the siege stopped only after the UN negotiated a tit-for-tat agreement whereby aid would be allowed through to two northern areas, encircled by anti-Assad rebels.
Madaya is not an exception. The UN estimates that at least 15 other Syrian towns are currently besieged, with more than 400,000 people denied access to food and medicine. Almost two years after a UN resolution that supposedly forced warring parties to let aid through, the situation seems only to have worsened. The number of Syrians deemed "at risk" has doubled, says the UN. Saving Madaya should blind no one to the fact that atrocities against civilians are ongoing, even intensifying, and that the Assad regime and its allies are overwhelmingly to blame.
For now, the priority is to get aid through. But it is essential not to lose sight of the need ultimately to hold those responsible for these crimes to account. There is a terrible list of horror and brutality. And when, one day, peace finally comes, the perpetrators must not be forgotten.

The Sun published stories obtained by phone hacking, says Glenn Mulcaire; 
Convicted hacker tells high court he gave paper information about Wayne Rooney and brothel receptionist in civil case brought against News UK by 16 public figures.

Jasper Jackson.

The private investigator whose arrest led to the closure of the News of the World has claimed that the Sun also published stories obtained through phone hacking.
In evidence presented to the high court on Thursday, convicted phone hacker Glenn Mulcaire detailed examples of stories published in the Sun between 2004 and 2006 that he said were obtained by intercepting voicemails under orders from the former News of the World news editor Greg Miskiw. 
"I am aware of stories that were published in the Sun that contained information that I obtained through the use of phone interception," says Mulcaire's written statement. "Due to the length of time that has passed I cannot recall every story.  
"However, I do recall several particular stories that I was tasked to provide information on, where I am almost certain that the information that I obtained through phone interception was published in the Sun newspaper."
Mulcaire claims says he used phone hacking to provide information for stories in the Sun about a convicted rapist who won the lottery while serving his sentence, and another about a brothel receptionist and the footballer Wayne Rooney.
The statement says: "I strongly suspect that this job - which relates to international footballer Wayne Rooney and former brothel receptionist Pat Tierney - was a job for the Sun via Greg Miskiw, who was based in Manchester at the time. I remember that 'The Sun' appears in the left-hand corner of one of the pages of my notebook, which also shows the names of Rooney and Tierney. This means the information ended up at the Sun as I would have been told this upon tasking."
Mulcaire alleges that though he was commissioned by Miskiw, the jobs were carried out for the Sun. In a separate statement, Miskiw admitted hacking phones while at the News of the World, but does not detail doing so for the Sun.
The stories Mulcaire cites were published during the editorship of Rebekah Brooks, who in September returned to become chief executive of News UK, a role she occupied at the company's previous incarnation, News International.
Brooks was cleared in 2014 of all charges relating to phone hacking at the News of the World while she was editor, prior to taking over at the Sun.
Mulcaire was arrested in 2006 along with the News of the World's royal correspondent, Clive Goodman, and sentenced to six months in prison in 2007 for hacking into the Clarence House phones. He was found guilty of further charges in 2014 and sentenced to a six-month suspended sentence. Miskiw, who left the News of the World in 2005 to set up his own news agency in Liverpool, was sentenced to six months in prison in July 2014 after pleading guilty to conspiracy to intercept voicemail messages.
Mulcaire's statement was presented at a pre-trial hearing in a civil claim brought by 16 celebrities and public figures who allege that their phones were hacked by newspapers owned by News UK. Five of the claimants say the Sun published stories based on information obtained by phone hacking. 
A number of claimants also allege that their phones were hacked by journalists working on the features desk before and after the period between 2005 and 2006, when convicted phone hacker Dan Evans worked there. Lawyers representing News UK subsidiary News Group Newspapers, through which the Sun is owned, claim that only Evans intercepted messages.
News UK denies phone hacking took place at the Sun. A spokesperson said: "Following many years of investigation, there were no charges against the Sun or its employees for voicemail interception. Today, certain claimants seeking financial settlements arising from activities at the News of the World have made unsubstantiated claims against the Sun. If the court permits such claims to proceed, the Sun will defend them vigorously."

Homan Square: inquiry into Chicago police 'should also cover facility'; 
Justice Department pressured to expand civil rights investigation as Rahm Emanuel's challenger calls secret detention warehouse's inclusion 'crucial'.

Zach Stafford in Chicago.

A major investigation into Chicago police should be extended to cover the detention warehouse Homan Square, a police interrogation facility exposed by the Guardian, a group of politicians have said. 
The Cook County board of commissioners, which oversees the second largest county in the US including the entirety of Chicago, approved a measure on Wednesday calling for the DoJ to expand its landmark investigation into the city's police department "to look into allegations of civil and human rights violations" at Homan Square.
That inquiry from the nation's top law enforcement agency came after video footage of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald being shot in the back by a Chicago police officer led to the forced resignation of the city's police chief, and a wider look by the justice department's civil-rights division which has only put more pressure on Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel to step down after police misconduct on his watch.  
 Related:  Homan Square: Chicago police chief's downfall prompts calls to shutter facility
"In order to begin to restore faith in our criminal justice system, it is crucial that the DoJ investigate these allegations and include Homan Square in its pattern and practices investigation," said Jesus "Chuy" Garcia, the county commissioner who nearly defeated Emanuel in a runoff election last year that turned on police reforms Barack Obama's former chief-of-staff has encouraged only since protests in late November over McDonald's death.
As Chicago's police take the national spotlight from Cleveland and Ferguson, Missouri, which were subject to similar DoJ inquiries into race-based policing and use of force, Cook County officials said the scale of Washington's investigation "provides us with an ideal opportunity" to bring to light more of the city's law-enforcement abuses.
"Any federal investigation of the Chicago police department that does not include Homan Square will be incomplete and woefully inadequate," said commissioner Richard J Boykin .
At Boykin's latest of several hearings on the warehouse, an activist and two attorneys who have worked with suspects detained for prolonged periods at Homan Square argued that the city's notoriously brutal police force had become too protected by city hall for such allegations to be held up to official scrutiny from within the city.
"The only means by which we can establish concrete facts and hold responsible parties to account is by impartial review," said activist Jonathan Terassi, "because reporting has shown that misconduct from CPD officers and units working out of Homan Square is both a pattern and a practice."
The board's resolution, which cites "allegations of torture, denial of counsel and off-the-books detentions [that] raise serious questions of human and constitutional rights violations", is non-binding. But the last-minute support from multiple politicians - including Garcia, who told the Guardian he found such allegations "disturbing" - is significant from the county commissioners who have longed proved a thorn in Emanuel's side.
Calls for the justice department to investigate Homan Square independently began almost immediately after the Guardian last year published the first in a series of investigative reports, which include more than 20 first-hand accounts of detention at the facility - as well as documents recording more than 7,000 people held without access to an attorney.
Commissioner Boykin and US representative Danny Davis hand-delivered to the attorney general a request for the Department of Justice to investigate Homan Square in March. On the same day US attorney general Loretta Lynch announced her inquiry into the entire department nearly nine months later - after a judge ordered the unsealing of the McDonald footage, and Emanuel had fired police commissioner Garry McCarthy - she called the Homan Square allegations "extremely important". 
While the facility was not included in the DoJ's initial investigation, "we always reserve the right to expand it", said Lynch.
A spokeswoman for the Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether the agency had yet to receive the resolution or reconsidered the scope of its inquiry. 
But activists, continuing to protest about Homan Square amid their calls for Emanuel to resign, are hoping for more than extra oversight by the US government: they want the warehouse shut down.
"We have been consistently campaigning for the closing of Homan Square ever since we found out about it," Frank Chapman, field organizer of Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression's Stop Police Crimes project, said after McCarthy's firing. "We wouldn't have found out about it if it wasn't for the Guardian because no Chicago newspaper whispered a word about it."
Charlene Carruthers, an organizer with the activist group Black Youth Project 100, said she believed the Guardian's reporting on Homan Square had directly resulted in the police chief's resignation but, with a series of policing scandals swarming Chicago, that the mayor should be next.
"They lead a city where it's very clear the police yield abusive power over people, and they're complicit in it," Carruthers said of the Emanuel administration last month. "It includes Laquan McDonald, and it goes far, far, far beyond what happened to Laquan."

America is finally waking up to its inequality problem; 
Under Obama, the economic recovery has bypassed almost all Americans. They won't stay silent for ever - and Bernie Sanders could be their inspiration.

Owen Jones.

To critique Barack Obama's presidency is to be guilty of these cardinal sins: blasphemy, ingratitude and a lack of realism. What was once the nation of Jim Crow produced the first African-American president, the most liberal commander-in-chief since Richard Nixon (as Obama himself once put it ). Funny, charming, with a coolness that eludes practically every other politician, he is the ultimate ambassador for US power. Could the United States possibly elect someone more progressive?
 Related:  Why does Bernie Sanders continue to avoid a foreign policy platform? | Lucia Graves 
And yet it is difficult not to conclude that, as Obama delivers his final State of the Union address, the US remains a chronically unjust and devastatingly unequal society, its proud democracy beholden to powerful and wealthy interests. It is this potential tinderbox that makes the implausibly clown-like, quasi-fascist Donald Trump the Republican frontrunner; and, more hopefully, a 74-year-old self-described socialist from Vermont - Bernie Sanders -a serious challenger to the Clinton machine.
That's not to diminish Obama's achievements. The lack of universal healthcare has long made the US a baffling aberration among developed nations; Obamacare's significantly increased coverage should not be sniffed at. Obama's U-turn on his public stance on equal marriage - yes, made possible by the struggle and sacrifice of US LGBT activists - is another triumph. His recent activism on the great US guns scandal and the existential threat of climate change is to be applauded, too.
But consider the plight of the majority of Americans. We know that, six years into his presidency, poverty was still higher than before the financial system near-imploded. While child poverty has been alleviated for many Americans in the past five years, for African-Americans it has remained stubbornly constant.
The gains of economic recovery have certainly been beneficial to those of great wealth - including the culprits behind the crash - but have meant little to the average American. Of course, that has everything to do with the structure of the US economy since Ronald Reagan swept to power. Consider this: according to the Economic Policy Institute - a thinktank close to the embattled US labour movement - between 1979 and 2007, the top 1% seized 53.9% of the entire increase in US income. It is often suggested that male median income has been stagnant in the US since the 1970s, hidden only by a flood of women into the workforce: how that's worked out depends on all sorts of qualifications, such as which price index you choose. Yet even by the most optimistic calculations, if university-educated American men have enjoyed a boost in salaries, those with only high school qualifications endured sliding incomes between 1979 and 2013.
But if Reaganism engineered this model, Obamaism failed to replace it. According to Emmanuel Saez, a US economics professor, between Obama's inauguration in 2009 and 2013, pre-tax income among the top 1% has jumped from $871,100 to $968,000 ; for everybody else, it practically stood still.
Yes, the top 1% suffered a bigger hit in the crash (but how they bounced back), employers' healthcare contributions have to be factored in, and Obama's administration introduced a more progressive tax system than the one Bush bequeathed. Yet here is an economy structurally geared to favour the very wealthiest. A woman in a full-time job takes home the same paypacket as she did in 2007; a man, slightly less. In 2014, hourly wages after inflation were falling or flatlining for most American workers. US workers might be more productive, but they will struggle to see the gains in their bank balances.
 Related:  Bernie Sanders: free public college tuition is the 'right thing to do'
That's before we even deal with foreign policy. We all know of Bush's Iraq folly, opposed by Obama himself; but, as Isis marches across the coast of chaos-ravaged Libya, we spend too little time addressing the president's own foreign calamity. Drones that former US service personnel have described as recruiting sergeants for Isis ; the failure to redeem his promise to shut Guant·namo ; the failure to secure a just peace in Palestine.
Across the western world, popular discontent is either being funnelled into the ranks of the xenophobic populist right, or new progressive movements of the left. For all too many struggling middle-income and poor Americans, it is Trump who has become the answer, directing their anger at anyone but the powerful. But whether or not Bernie Sanders secures the nomination, his movement offers some hope to cure the ills of modern America.
Without the support of Big Money, Sanders's grassroots campaign raised $73m last year. With primary elections looming, Hillary Clinton is now in a dead heat with Sanders in Iowa; in New Hampshire, he is ahead. His movement could transform the Democratic party.
None of this is to scapegoat Obama. Even the most well-intentioned president will struggle against a system described last year by Princeton researchers as an "oligarchy", where the median net worth of a senator in 2013 was $2.8m. But fewer Americans are self-identifying as conservative ; younger Americans have far more progressive views than their elders. Black Lives Matter and Occupy have forced long-ignored issues on to the agenda.
Obama's presidency has failed to build the just America its citizens deserve. But the US has a proud history of bottom-up movements that have overcome injustice. Their time may have come again.

IAAF council 'could not have been unaware' of doping in athletics - as it happened; 
The second part of the Wada report has claimed that the IAAF council 'could not have been unaware' of doping in athletics but he refused to blame Lord Coe, insisting the former London 2012 chief is the best man to lead the IAAF out of their current crisis.

The report says that the IAAF council could not have been unaware of doping athletics
Dick Pound says Lord Coe is the best person to carry on as the IAAF president and days he doesn't believe that the former London 2012 chief knew about the doping
But he does say that there was a cover-up - something Coe denied on Wednesday.
Instead Pound blames organisational failure and says the blame extends beyond the Diacks but continued to absolve Coe of blame.
Of course, the Diacks are not without blame and Pound said that everything began with the former IAAF president Lamine Diack who "was responsible for organizing and enabling the conspiracy and corruption" that took place.
The commission also fears that instances of extortion in Russia and Turkey may be the 'tip of the iceberg'

And here's Owen Gibson's first take from Munich ...
The first part of the report confirms much of what was outlined in last week's ethics commission report into how the IAAF president's son, his lawyer and the head of its anti doping unit covered up doping violations and extorted money from the Russian marathon runner Lillya Shubokhova but also includes the tantalising detail that Lamine Diack told IAAF legal chief Hugh Roberts that the delay in sanctioning Russian athletes had put him in a "difficult position" that could only be resolved through his friendship with Vladimir Putin. As revealed by the Guardian last week, the cabal tried a similar extortion trick on Turkish 2012 1500m gold medallist Asli Alptekin.
The report says that the IAAF Council, of whom Coe was a member: "The IAAF Council could not have been unaware of the extent of doping in athletics and the non-enforcement of applicable anti-doping rules". It also says: "The IAAF Council could not have been unaware of the level of nepotism that operated within the IAAF".
The report is damning of the IAAF and the extent to which those within the organisation have admitted knowing the full extent of the problems with Russian doping and suggests it is stil in denial.
"There was far greater knowledge within the IAAF of problems in Russia than it was willing to acknowledge," it concludes. The "rogue individuals" defence and the idea that IAAF staff were "all but blameless" and "truly shocked" when they discovered level of corruption is not tenable. "It is increasingly clear that far more staff knew about the problems than has been currently acknowledged," it says. "The circle of knowledge of the offending conduct within the IAAF is much larger than has been acknowledged".
Nick Davies, the former deputy secretary general and Coe's right hand man, comes in for particular criticism. He stood down in December when an email emerged suggesting he was conspiring with Papa Massata Diack over the announcement of Russian doping bans around the Moscow 2013 world championships. When the commission interviewed Davies in June 2015 he did not mention any knowledge of delays or "Russian skeletons in the cupboard".

More now on the news that France has issued an international wanted notice via Interpol for Papa Massata Diack ...
The French arrest warrant for Papa Massata Diack which has been transmitted as an international wanted alert via Interpol means he could be arrested if he travels outside his home country of Senegal, especially to European Union countries with which France's legal authorities work closely.
 In November, French prosecutor Eliane Houlette told The Associated Press that authorities had planned to arrest Papa Massata Diack at around the same time that they also took his father into custody, in a hotel room, in November.
 "We didn't arrest Mr. Diack's son because he didn't come to Paris when he was meant to. But he is also implicated in this affair," she said. "We haven't had the opportunity to arrest him in France. We would have done so if we could."
 The Interpol alert is based on a French arrest warrant that was issued for Papa Massata Diack in December.

France has issued an international wanted notice via Interpol for Papa Massata Diack, the son of former IAAF President Lamine Diack, saying he is wanted for corruption and money laundering. 
The French request was lodged last month. The so-called Red Notice is posted on Interpol's website. That alerts Interpol's members that Diack is wanted in France.
The notice says the former IAAF marketing consultant is "wanted by the judicial authorities of France for prosecution to serve a sentence."
France's national financial prosecutor told The Associated Press last year that Papa Massata Diack is suspected of being actively involved in a bribery and blackmail scheme also allegedly involving his father when he presided over the governing body of track and field. The elder Diack was arrested in France last November and subsequently charged with corruption and money laundering. Also under criminal investigation in France are Diack's former legal counsel, Habib Cisse, and the IAAF's former director of anti-doping, Gabriel Cisse.

Homan Square: legislators vote for DoJ inquiry of Chicago police to add facility; 
Justice Department pressured to expand civil rights investigation as Rahm Emanuel's challenger calls secret detention warehouse's inclusion 'crucial'.

Zach Stafford in Chicago.

Watchdog politicians aiming to replace a lack of internal law enforcement oversight by the city of Chicago have passed a resolution that ignites legislative pressure on the US government to investigate a police interrogation facility exposed by the Guardian.
The Cook County board of commissioners, which oversees the second largest county in the US including the entirety of Chicago, approved a measure on Wednesday calling for the Department of Justice to expand its landmark investigation into the city's police department "to look into allegations of civil and human rights violations" at the detention warehouse known as Homan Square.
That inquiry from the nation's top law enforcement agency represented a domino effect: video footage of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald being shot in the back by a Chicago police officer led to the forced resignation of the city's police chief, and a wider look by the justice department's civil-rights division has only hurled more pressure on Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel to step down after police misconduct on his watch.  
But even politicians, activists and attorneys who saw the Guardian's reports on Homan Square as signals of secrecy "far, far, far beyond" a single police-shooting cover-up have acknowledged - after Wednesday's surprisingly unanimous vote - that federal pressure on the department marked a turning point for their attempts to shutter the facility.

"In order to begin to restore faith in our criminal justice system, it is crucial that the DoJ investigate these allegations and include Homan Square in its pattern and practices investigation," said Jesus "Chuy" Garcia, the county commissioner who nearly defeated Emanuel in a runoff election last year that teetered on the very police reforms Barack Obama's former chief-of-staff has encouraged only since protests over McDonald's death.
As Chicago's police re-inherit the national spotlight from Cleveland and Ferguson, Missouri, which were subject to similar DoJ inquiries into race-based policing and use of force, Cook County officials said the scale of Washington's investigation "provides us with an ideal opportunity" to bring to light more of the city's law-enforcement abuses.
"Any federal investigation of the Chicago police department that does not include Homan Square will be incomplete and woefully inadequate," said commissioner Richard J Boykin .
At Boykin's latest of several hearings on the warehouse, an activist and two attorneys who have worked with suspects detained for prolonged periods at Homan Square argued that the city's notoriously brutal police force had become too protected by city hall for such allegations to be held up to official scrutiny from anywhere but outside Chicago.
"The only means by which we can establish concrete facts and hold responsible parties to account is by impartial review," said activist Jonathan Terassi, "because reporting has shown that misconduct from CPD officers and units working out of Homan Square is both a pattern and a practice."
The board's resolution, which cites "allegations of torture, denial of counsel and off-the-books detentions [that] raise serious questions of human and constitutional rights violations", is non-binding. But the last-minute sponsorship from multiple politicians - including Garcia, who told the Guardian he found such allegations "disturbing" - showed a kind of groundswell among the county commissioners, who have longed proved a thorn in Emanuel's side.
Calls for the justice department to investigate Homan Square independently began almost immediately after the Guardian published the first in a series of investigative reports, which include more than 20 first-hand accounts of detention at the facility - as well as documents recording more than 7,000 people held without access to an attorney.
Commissioner Boykin and US representative Danny Davis hand-delivered to the attorney general a request for the Department of Justice to investigate Homan Square in March. On the same day she announced her inquiry into the entire department nearly nine months later - after a judge ordered the unsealing of the McDonald footage, and Emanuel had fired police commissioner Garry McCarthy - Loretta Lynch called the Homan Square allegations "extremely important". 
While the facility was not included in the DoJ's initial investigation, "we always reserve the right to expand it", said the nation's top law enforcement officer.
A spokeswoman for the Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether the agency had yet to receive the resolution or reconsidered the scope of its inquiry. 
But activists, continuing to protest Homan Square amid their calls for Emanuel to resign, are hoping for more than extra oversight by the US government: they want the warehouse shut down.
"We have been consistently campaigning for the closing of Homan Square ever since we found out about it," Frank Chapman, field organizer of Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression's Stop Police Crimes project, said after McCarthy's firing. "We wouldn't have found out about it if it wasn't for the Guardian because no Chicago newspaper whispered a word about it."
Charlene Carruthers, an organizer with the activist group Black Youth Project 100, said she believed the Guardian's reporting on Homan Square had directly resulted in the police chief's resignation but, with a series of policing scandals swarming Chicago, that the mayor should be next.
"They lead a city where it's very clear the police yield abusive power over people, and they're complicit in it," Carruthers said of the Emanuel administration last month. "It includes Laquan McDonald, and it goes far, far, far beyond what happened to Laquan."

Renault shares plunge after police raids on sites; 
French stock market falls and almost (EURO)5bn wiped off carmaker's market value after news of police raids at sites reportedly linked to emissions engineering.

Julia Kollewe.

Shares in Renault tumbled more than 20% on news that police had raided several of the French carmaker's sites.
 Initial reports suggested the raids were connected to the Volkswagen emissions scandal but Renault, which confirmed that fraud investigators had searched three sites last week,  said  "no evidence of a defeat device equipping Renault vehicles" had been found.  
The carmaker said investigators had decided to carry out additional checks on parts and factories to look at the way it uses exhaust emissions technology, following an earlier investigation by the French government.
The raid was first reported by Agence France-Presse, and sent Renault's shares sharply lower. They fell to (EURO)68.74, wiping (EURO)5bn (£3.7bn) off the company's market value and depressing European markets. Already down around 2% on the back of lower oil prices, the French stock market, CAC, and its German counterpart, the DAX, extended their losses to more than 3% after the Renault reports. 
Shares in other carmakers also fell, with Peugeot down 6.6%, even though the company said emissions tests carried out by the French energy ministry on its cars showed no anomalies and that it had not been subject to searches by fraud investigators. In Frankfurt, Daimler was down 5.5%, BMW lost 4.5% and Volkswagen shed 4.6%.
                     A union official, Florent Grimaldi, told Reuters : "There were searches at several Renault sites by fraud investigators. Management has not confirmed that it is about NOx emissions but given the sectors that were inspected we think that it could be linked."
Since Volkswagen admitted in September it had used software to manipulate emissions tests in some diesel vehicles, investigations have been launched in several countries into the German carmaker, but also into other car manufacturers.

How to watch Netflix as a feminist; 
Last week, Emma Watson launched a feminist book club called Our Shared Shelf - but with binge-watching easily as popular as book-reading, isn't it time we had a feminist TV club? Here are five Netflix picks that make the cut.

Arwa Mahdawi.

Look, I've got nothing against books. Some of my best friends are books. Book clubs, though, are another matter. I've always had an almost pathological aversion to joining one. They seem to me to be an excuse to drink wine and be pretentious, and I don't need an excuse to do either. My antipathy for book clubs means I'm not one of the 68,640 people who, at the time of writing, have joined Emma Watson's feminist book club. Launched last week, the club is called Our Shared Shelf and is hosted on Goodreads.com. The first book is My Life on the Road by Gloria Steinem.
 Related:  Emma Watson starts feminist book group on Twitter 
I applaud Watson's initiative, but I can't help but wish she had set up a feminist Netflix club instead. Not just because I'm anti book clubs, but because it would serve the greater good. I mean, let's be real, only 1% of any book club actually read the book. That's the first rule of book clubs. Meanwhile, 99% of people with a Netflix subscription regularly binge-watch programmes and are actively seeking ways to justify this binge-watching as an important social exercise. Right?
Since Watson is busy, I've decided to start a feminist Netflix club myself. It will be called Netchicks. No, no, it won't. Streaming Feminists? Nah, not right either. Let's take a leaf out of Watson's book club and call it Our Shared Netflix Password. While finding a name is easy, deciding on the content is a little trickier. After several hours down a Google research rabbit hole I am depressed, disoriented and dubious. Every show I Googled had been alternately described as both the best thing and the worst thing to ever happen to feminism. I had gone deep into the feminist-pseudoacademic-industrial complex and it had given me a complex. But, after much debate, here is my preliminary list of feminist Netflix club picks. And if there is one discussion point that governs the lot of them, it's this: have we outgrown the Bechdel test now? And if we have (and I think we have), what do we replace it with?

Jessica Jones
 Netflix's first female-fronted superhero show is an obvious choice. Jones uses her super-strength to save the world from the evil manipulations of Killgrave, a straight, white man. Right on! But it isn't Jessica's strength that makes the show noteworthy; it's her weaknesses. Forget having it all or leaning in, Jessica is an angry alcoholic loner. Partly, this is a result of Killgrave's abuse. But Killgrave is too pathetic, too undeveloped a character to be entirely convincing as a villain and the most fascinating element of Jessica Jones is the struggle around agency. How much is Jessica a victim and how much is she clutching at the idea of victimhood as an all-absolving identity? Feminism, like everything else, has its flaws, and Jessica Jones makes no attempts to hide them.

Scream
 Horror movies aren't known for their feminism. The promiscuous die first; middle-class virgins survive; women are generally slashed, raped and tortured. However, one of the first mainstream, category-defying horror films was 90s classic Scream. The film repeatedly draws attention to misogynistic horror tropes, then upturns them. In one scene, Sidney Prescott, the main character and " final gir l" is told: "You're not a virgin. Now you got to die. Those are the rules." But Sidney kills her would-be killer and stars in several sequels, becoming a self-help author.

The Fall
 In The Fall, Gillian Anderson plays a detective hunting down a serial killer who targets young women. There is a strong female lead, an almost painful peeling back of the layers of sexual and structural violence against women, and a lot of feminist speechifying. Now, speechifying can backfire. Take season four of Scandal, for example, in which Olivia Pope's intermittent tirades against the wage gap or the words used to describe women seem as if the drama has been paused for a public service announcement. Anderson's speeches, however, are so brutally matter-of-fact that they make a point without belabouring it, and it's a joy to watch. When confronted about a one-night stand, for example, Anderson says: "Man fucks woman. Subject: man; verb: fucks; object: woman. That's OK. Woman fucks man. Woman: subject; man: object. That's not so comfortable for you, is it?"

Pretty Little Liars
 This show revolves around a group of girls who are being tormented by a mysterious antagonist, defying numerous murder attempts in high heels and perfect makeup. There are many reasons why this shouldn't be a feminist show but - largely due to its excellent depiction of friendship - it is. When one of the girls comes out as gay, it's a non-issue. She's a character; she's not the "gay character". I wish this show had been around when I was a teenager.

Master of None
                     Creator Aziz Ansari follows 30-year-old Dev as he wanders New York doing mundane things with a group of friends. The show also regularly illustrates everyday racism and sexism, with episode seven, for example, juxtaposing a woman's experience walking home alone at night (terrifying) with a man's (unremarkable). Unfortunately these points, much lauded by the media, often feel heavy-handed and a recognition of - wow! - a male writer articulating the female experience. Really, the show is on this list for one reason only: Denise. Denise is a black lesbian who is friends with Ansari's character and frequently nails, deadpan, in one sentence, what every stretched out "feminist" scene completely overstates.

 11 Jan: The Guardian reveals that Papa Massata Diack, who acted as a marketing consultant for the IAAF, had apparently sent an email to International Olympic Committee members in 2008 arranging for "parcels" to be delivered to senior IOC members.
 12 Jan: The Associated Press reports that the IAAF considered hiding Russian doping bans from the public before London 2012 and recognised that more than 42% of all tested elite athletes from the country were cheating.
 13 Jan: Coe denies any 'cover-up' at the IAAF and denies suggestions he is underestimating the seriousness of the crisis engulfing athletics' governing body.

 Good afternoon.  Dick Pound, formerly the president of the World Anti-Doping Agency, will shortly hold a press conference following the release of the second part of his report into the doping scandal currently engulfing athletics. Whereas the first part focused on Russian state-sponsored doping, the second part will focus more on attempted cover-ups within athletics' governing body, the IAAF.
Earlier, the Associated Press reported that they have been provided details of the 89-page investigation and the news agency claims that the report will conclude that there was no way members of the world athletics governing body's council, which included the current president Sebastian Coe, could have been unaware of the extent of doping and non-enforcement of the rules in track and field.
Coe has travelled to Munich, along with the Guardian's Owen Gibson, who is expecting more uncomfortable questions for the former London 2012 chief.
Sebastian Coe, the president of world athletics' embattled governing body, will be under further pressure on Thursday as fresh allegations are outlined of widespread corruption at the heart of the sport.
The crisis facing world athletics has grown over the past two years to the level where many consider it to be worse than the turmoil enveloping Fifa that led to the downfall of Sepp Blatter, mass arrests by the US Department of Justice and a generation of executives being implicated in a $200m-plus bribery scandal.
Dick Pound, the former president of World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada), is to present the second part of his report into systemic doping in Russia and attempted cover-ups at the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). He is among those who believe the scandal in athletics is worse because it "affects the results on the field of play" as opposed to "moving money around like the Fifa boys".

Top Gear relaunch faces potential clash with new ITV motoring show; 
The Drive, featuring Louis Walsh and Mariella Frostrup, scheduled to debut around same time as Chris Evans's take on BBC show.

Mark Sweney.

ITV's new Top Gear rival could launch against from Chris Evans's take on the original BBC2 motoring show, with both scheduled to debut in the coming months. 
ITV has announced details of its new show, The Drive, in which eight celebrities will compete against each other in a series of races and vehicles.
The broadcaster has signed up Louis Walsh, Mariella Frostrup, Angus Deayton, weather presenter Laura Tobin, Johnny Vegas, rapper Professor Green, singer Ella Eyre and Olympic athlete turned presenter Colin Jackson.
The five-part series, hosted by Vernon Kay with former professional driver Jason Plato offering expert advice, is expected to air by the summer. 
Evans's new-look Top Gear, which has been beset by problems including the loss of his hand-picked executive producer Lisa Clark after just five months, is to launch at the beginning of May.
While the two shows are not direct competitors, there are similarities, with early reports about ITV's programme referring to it as a take on Top Gear's "star in a reasonably priced car" time-trial segment.
And while ITV's schedulers are yet to confirm a broadcast date, Evans is unlikely to appreciate a new, high-profile motoring-themed show to potentially overlap and steal some of the PR thunder of his highly anticipated relaunch of Top Gear on 8 May.
ITV's show will use a knockout format that will culminate in a final involving a race with Formula 4000 racing cars. The programme is being made by TwoFour Productions, the company behind Splash! and The Hotel Inspector.
Kay said: "Everyone thinks they can drive - but can they? This show will test not only their skills behind the wheel, but also how they control their fear. Drive is not just about straight-line speed, all driving skills are going to be tested. But when it's not your clutch you're burning or your tyres you're shredding, it's full steam ahead."
Speaking in California last week, Evans admitted the atmosphere at Top Gear was "apocalyptic" and "armageddon"-like when he joined, following the assault scandal that resulted in Jeremy Clarkson and ultimately his co-hosts, James May and Richard Hammond, and executive producer, Andy Wilman, leaving the show.
Evans, who is filming scenes for the show in the US, admitted the hectic schedule and pressure to reinvent the programme had been a "baptism of fire, to say the least".

Bowie was to the 70s what the Beatles were to the 60s; 
If the Beatles captured a 60s of optimism and love, Bowie was the signature artist of the 70s - distilling paranoia and confusion into pop both euphoric and terrifying.

Dorian Lynskey.

David Bowie had no feel for the 1960s. No wonder he floundered. Neither flower-power optimism nor insurrectionary bravado really turned him on: as he wrote in All the Young Dudes : "We never got it off on that revolution stuff." Even Space Oddity fixated on the loneliness of space travel rather than the pioneer spirit.
The 1970s, though: there was a decade that spoke to his anxieties. A decade of cults, terrorists, scandals, recessions, defeats, environmental panic and a sense of constant crisis - what Francis Wheen described in his book Strange Days Indeed: The Golden Age of Paranoia as "a pungent melange of apocalyptic dread and conspiratorial fervour". Bowie was to the 70s what the Beatles were to the 60s: a lightning rod, a tuning fork, a mirror. With his mastery of dread, and the excitements of dread, the man who described himself as "an awful pessimist" understood the decade's strange energies like no other musician.
 Related:  David Bowie: the man who thrilled the world 
For Bowie, the 70s started a little late. He described 1970 as "a waste of a year" because the delayed release of The Man Who Sold the World enhanced his sense of depression and pointlessness; the unreleased Tired of My Life presented him as a typical victim of post-60s malaise. He only began to survey the new decade with confidence on Hunky Dory (1971) and what he saw was an exhausted landscape of fallen icons and sunken dreams, crying out for change. Life on Mars? was his tour of the cultural ruins, with a teenage heroine who deserved better. Bowie saw "a leadership void" in rock and felt that the hungry new generation he described in Changes and Oh! You Pretty Things needed a new kind of rock star, attuned to the chaotic vibrations of the time: someone like David Bowie.
Ziggy Stardust was the physical expression of Bowie's intellectual fascination with stardom and the power of exceptional individuals, fed by Warhol and Nietzsche. In Bowie's brain the overlapping appeal of rock stars and dictators that disturbed leftwing observers was rather exciting. At a time when more histrionic commentators were comparing western democracies to Weimar Germany, he revelled in decadence and desperate hedonism. Not everyone was as precise as the Jehovah's Witnesses, who predicted that the world would end in 1975, but there was a growing fear that time and resources were running out. Bestsellers included Hal Lindsey's grimly millenarian tome The Late Great Planet Earth. Hollywood's best directors struck a note of cynicism and unravelling. Newspaper editorials warned of irreversible decline. And there was Bowie-as-Ziggy singing, "We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot." Ziggy was killed off after a year because he had to die. Time was racing on.
In 1973, Bowie returned from a show in Japan via a long, grim train journey through the USSR and the Eastern Bloc, arriving home to tell his wife, Angie: "After what I've seen of this world, I've never been so damned scared in my life." Assembled from the debris of incomplete concept albums, Diamond Dogs (1974) was a marriage of two dystopias: the grey police state of Nineteen Eighty-Four and the insurgent anarchy of A Clockwork Orange. Again, it felt timely when American cities were facing bankruptcy and the oil crisis threatened the western way of life. Bowie imagined that his tribe of feral urchins, the "diamond dogs", would use rollerskates because there was no oil for cars. "This ain't rock'n'roll," he cried, madly. "This is genocide."
Bowie moved to New York in 1974, when the US was experiencing the painful spasms of the Nixon administration's death spiral, and detected "the lilting phrase before the crashing crescendo". Young Americans (1975) found him searching for liberation in Philadelphia soul and "one damn song that can make me break down and cry" yet alienated by cocaine (the 70s rock'n'roll drug) and "psychological terror". The title track saw America as a garbled stream of images glimpsed through a limousine window by a cold, curious outsider.
 Related:  Bowie in quotes: 'I wouldn't like to make singing a full-time occupation'
It was while he was bunkered in America that Bowie began getting into trouble for predicting the emergence of a Hitleresque figure who would scythe through the mess and impose tyranny. "I believe very strongly in fascism," he blathered, to his lasting regret. "Adolf Hitler was one of the first rock stars." He couldn't have known that in a feverish corner of the British elite, powerful men such as the SAS founder David Stirling, were talking about giving Britain a dose of what Pinochet had brought to Chile. Historians tend to identify 1975 as the nadir of 70s paranoia and gloom (writing at the time, Martin Amis thought that "everything seemed ready for the terminal lurch") and that was when Bowie recorded Station to Station (released in 1976), in which he scrabbled for a way out of the psychological pit he had dug for himself while fretting, "It's too late." This is the Bowie (and the America) we find so bleakly riveting in The Man Who Fell to Earth. A man who was all too convincing as a bewildered alien.
Another thing that makes Bowie the quintessential 70s artist is that his work was the junction box for so many of the decade's divergent styles, including glam-rock, soul, funk and krautrock. The love of Kraftwerk and Neu! that filtered into Station to Station was one of the things that led him to West Berlin for Low, "Heroes" (both 1977), and Lodger (1979) where his hectic velocity took on a different flavour. He was not exactly upbeat. "People simply can't cope with the rate of change in this world," he said. "It's all far too fast ... And it'll get worse. There's not really a cause for hope." But his Berlin music's freshness was a kind of optimism. In this cold war city, an isolated outpost of a country convulsed by terrorism, he pulled back from despair. Even when he worried about nuclear war on Fantastic Voyage (the Soviets had just invaded Afghanistan) he sounded more like a liberal humanist than an apocalyptic prophet. He was, he said, "learning to be happy", in his fashion.
These three albums reasserted Bowie's importance despite the onslaught of punk (whose ferocious stars reminded him of the diamond dogs) and anticipated the sound and style of the 1980s, when the myriad artists the Pet Shop Boys recently described as "Bowie's children" would thrive. He emerged intact, if not undamaged, from a decade that he had done more than anybody to define. Fear - of the future, of irrelevance, of himself - was the fuel that propelled him through it. He was not alone in being scared but nobody else so consistently channelled that anxiety into art whose brilliance was a kind of consolation.

Spotlight: the reporters who uncovered Boston's Catholic child abuse scandal; 
A Boston Globe investigation into widespread child abuse by Catholic clergy has been turned into a new film starring Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams. The Pulitzer-winning team talk small-town secrets, collective guilt - and whether anything has really changed within the church.

Henry Barnes.

On the homepage of the Boston Roman Catholic archdiocese website, next to information on preparing for marriage, is a box labelled "Support, Protection and Prevention". You have to scroll to see the first reference to children and click a link to find any mention of abuse.
In 2002, the Boston Globe's Spotlight team, a group of five investigative journalists, uncovered the widespread sexual abuse of children by scores of the district's clergy. They also revealed a cover-up: that priests accused of misconduct were being systematically removed and allowed to work in other parishes.
The team's investigation brought the issue to national prominence in the US, winning them the Pulitzer prize for public service. The journalists' story, and those who suffered at the hands of the clergy, are the subject of Spotlight, a Hollywood movie starring Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams. It is a love letter to investigative journalism and a reminder that, 13 years and some $3bn in settlement payments later, survivors in Boston and beyond are still waiting for satisfactory long-term action from the Vatican. 
"The Catholic church often talks about this as pain that's in the past," says Spotlight's co-screenwriter, Josh Singer. "I think the survivors would tell you they're less interested in the church trying to make amends and more interested in the church protecting children in the future."
Singer, who was a writer and editor on The West Wing, calls the Spotlight journalists of 2002 a "championship team". Their player-manager was Boston native Walter "Robby" Robinson. His high school, which was across the road from the Boston Globe's offices, employed three priests who were later suspended for misconduct. In the film, Robinson, played by Michael Keaton, represents the Globe's old guard. He's navigating a community that's very Catholic and very close-knit, working on a contentious story for a paper that he says at the time was "too deferential to the church".
"Every major city in the US has two things in common," Robinson tells me. "They have an archdiocese and they have a major newspaper. I don't know of a single city where, in hindsight, clues that this was going on didn't surface way back when. If we'd been more open to the notion that such an iconic institution might have committed such heinous crimes I think people would have got on to this sooner."
It was this implicit deference by the police, attorneys and, to some degree, the press that interested Singer in the story. In a key scene, a lawyer who represents the victims says: "It takes a village to raise a child. It takes a village to abuse one."
"That collective looking away was always interesting," Singer says. "How had the community fostered this? That seemed to have bigger power and resonance, because that is similar to what's still going on with Penn State or Jimmy Savile at the BBC".

"Sometimes we need to question a little more when we are part of an insider group," he says. "To listen to the outsiders."
Phil Saviano was battling to get his story heard long before the Spotlight team's stories were published. Saviano, a survivor who was abused by his parish priest from the age of 12, had sent the Globe information on the Boston clergy that reporters originally missed. In the film, Saviano (played by actor Neal Huff) tells the Spotlight team that, for a kid from a poor family in Boston, being groomed by his priest was like being singled out by the Almighty : "How do you say no to God?" 
Saviano, now in his 60s, was one of the victims who refused a settlement from the church and retained, unlike others, his right to speak freely about his experience. He's the founding member of the New England chapter of the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests. After the Spotlight investigation, Snap's membership swelled to more than 22,000 as victims came forward, according to its executive director, David Clohessy.
"Before Spotlight's work, Snap members were usually ignored," he says. "They were unsuccessfully trying to warn parishioners, parents, police, prosecutors and the public about this massive, ongoing danger to kids. After Spotlight's work, people started to pay attention."
'Reporters talk on the phone, we do data entry, we look at court records. Good luck making that interesting!'
  Sacha Pfeiffer    
                     Michael Rezendes, played by Mark Ruffalo in the film, is the only journalist involved in the investigation still working on the Spotlight team. Rezendes describes the experience of having his story turned into a movie as "strange and intrusive", but he's a big fan of the finished product.
"We call Boston the biggest small town in America," says Rezendes. "Everybody seems to know everyone. The film-makers probed that pretty deeply, and were able to make a statement about the collective ability to speak out when you see wrongdoing."
"I had huge reservations about letting Hollywood fictionalise our lives," says Sacha Pfeiffer, another member of the Spotlight team, who is played by Rachel McAdams. "We talk on the phone, we do data entry, we look at court records. Good luck making that interesting!"

But there was no need to sensationalise the story, says the screenwriter - the procedure and the scale of the scandal were compelling enough. Still, the film is more All the President's Men than Broadcast News ("Watergate was a local story, so was this," says Singer). There is no bitching, little jostling, only the occasional glimpse of ego. Working at the dawn of online news, the team spend hours rifling through giant church directories, begging to use the state legislator's photocopier. Just as they are ready to print, their editor (Marty Baron, portrayed by Liev Schreiber) tells them to stop and take stock. 
The Spotlight team had identified 12 priests who they knew had been implicated in child sex abuse. They wanted to get the names out there, but Baron told them to hold their fire and aim for the bigger target: the Catholic church itself. "Would an editor have that sort of restraint now?" asks Singer. "As opposed to just throwing what you have up on the web? If you'd just run those names it would have been a he-said-she-said with every single one. Instead of talking about the bigger story, which is the system."
"The internet has forced us to think in short bursts," says Robinson. "We seldom have time to get a really strong grasp on what the full story is. Everybody's trying to get morsels out there, instead of the full meal."
The Spotlight story got told because Baron, newly arrived from the Miami Herald, told the locals how to see their city. The Globe's new editor was an outsider who questioned a norm: that the church was untouchable. That confidence - to follow a difficult story through against the prevailing wisdom - is a rare quality, says Robinson. And the investigative reporting that followed was expensive. "Editors tend to cut it first," says Robinson, "But ask a daily newsreader what is most important to them and they'll say investigative reporting." 
Spotlight has been well received by survivors ("It's re-energised many who have been discouraged by the intractability of the church", says David Clohessy), and the church itself has been broadly supportive. When asked if the archdiocese of Boston endorses the film, Terrence Donilon, communications officer to the city's archbishop, Cardinal Se·n O'Malley, said the archdiocese "would not discourage people from seeing the film", but viewing it "should be an individual choice".
Since the Spotlight investigation, the Vatican has moved to establish a tribunal to hear cases of bishops accused of perpetrating or covering up child abuse. Critics say its remit is foggy and its powers unclear. Pope Francis's visit to Boston last September was marred by his comments the week earlier that US bishops had shown "courage" in facing the scandal. Survivors responded with anger and incredulity. Generally, it is thought that the church still has a lot to learn about transparency.
"It's been 13 years since we published our stories," says Michael Rezendes. "So far, for survivors, there's been a tribunal that hasn't taken any concrete action. Over the last 10 years the Vatican has defrocked something like 850 priests and sanctioned maybe 2,500 more. But in terms of policy, there has been very little systemic change."

Volkswagen CEO meets head of US agency that exposed emissions scandal; 
Company's new boss, Matthias M¸ller, seeks to convince Environmental Protection Agency head Gina McCarthy to accept VW recall plans.

Rupert Neate in New York and agencies.

The chief executive of Volkswagen on Wednesday met the head of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the regulator that exposed the German car company's emissions cheating scandal.
                     Matthias M¸ller, who was promoted to VW CEO following the axing of the previous boss in the wake of the scandal, met EPA administrator Gina McCarthy in Washington.

This was M¸ller's first visit to the US since the scandal, which has wiped out a fifth of VW's market value, broke in September. M¸ller, who declined to speak to the media as he left the meeting in a VW-owned black Audi sedan, is trying to convince McCarthy to accept VW's proposals for how to recall and fix cars fitted with "defeat devices" design to underplay their nitrogen oxide emissions.
The meeting came a day after the California Air Resources Board (CARB) rejected VW's proposals for how to fix the problem as "incomplete, substantially deficient and [falling] far short of meeting the legal requirements". 
"Volkswagen made a decision to cheat on emissions tests and then tried to cover it up," Mary Nichols, the head of CARB, said. "They continued and compounded the lie and when they were caught, they tried to deny it. The result is thousands of tons of nitrogen oxide that have harmed the health of Californians. They need to make it right."
The California regulator's decision to reject VW's plan was endorsed by the EPA, which said: "Volkswagen has not submitted an approvable recall plan to bring the vehicles into compliance and reduce pollution. EPA has conveyed this to the company previously." 
M¸ller requested the meeting with McCarthy in order to discuss the emissions issue, which affects about 600,000 vehicles in the US and 11m across the world. 
After the meeting, VW issuing a statement saying: "We appreciate the time that Administrator McCarthy took to meet with us. Volkswagen will continue to fully cooperate."
McCarthy said: "We appreciated the conversation with Volkswagen. We will continue to work toward a solution."
The meeting risked being overshadowed by an interview M¸ller gave in which he appeared to play down the seriousness of the scandal as just a "technical problem". 
"We had some targets for our technical engineers, and they solved this problem and reached targets with some software solutions that haven't been compatible to the American law," M¸ller said in an interview with NPR on Tuesday. "We didn't lie. We didn't understand the question first."
VW's headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany, later issued a statement acknowledging "irritation" with M¸ller's choice of words, and pointed out he is not a native English speaker. "It is important for him to make clear: Volkswagen's apology for the breach of trust with the American people is meant sincerely and honestly," the company said.
The US Justice Department last week sued the German automaker over emissions-cheating software, potentially exposing the company to billions in fines for clean air violations.
Volkswagen set aside (EURO)6.7bn (£4.9bn, $7.3bn) to deal with the costs of recalling and fixing cars across the world, but penalties in the US lawsuit could cost Volkswagen more than $30,000 per vehicle, which could total as much as $18bn. 
Analysts have warned that the total cost of the scandal could be as high as (EURO)78bn (£58.6bn, $84.9bn), which would be 60% more than the Deepwater Horizon disaster cost BP.
At the time of filing the lawsuit last week, John Cruden, assistant attorney general and head of the Justice Department's environment and natural resources division, said: "Car manufacturers that fail to properly certify their cars and that defeat emission control systems breach the public trust, endanger public health, and disadvantage competitors."

Sun faces phone-hacking claims from five high court claimants; 
Documents laid before the court include allegations that phone hacking took place at the Sun from 2000 until 2006.

Jasper Jackson.

A bid to establish whether the Sun was involved in phone hacking has been launched at a hearing dealing with allegations from 16 celebrities and public figures against the newspaper's publisher, News Group Newspapers. 
The high court heard that of the 16 claimants, who include former EastEnders and Coronation Street actors, five allege that articles published in the Sun were obtained by the hacking of phones. The others say they were targeted by the now defunct News of the World.
The claims presented in court include examples provided by Simon Clegg, the former chief executive of the British Olympic Association, who says around half of the articles he alleges were obtained through phone hacking were published in the Sun. 
Lawyers for NGN say the stories about Clegg, who led the campaign to persuade the government to bid for the 2012 Olympics, were sourced through legitimate means.
Other celebrities who are part of the case against the two newspapers include the former FamilyFortunes presenter Les Dennis, Hear'Say singer and Coronation Street actor Kym Marsh and Doctors actor Sarah Manners. Documents laid before the court include allegations that phone hacking took place at the Sun from at least 2000 onwards and cite examples up to 2006, when the NoW royal editor Clive Goodman and the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire were arrested for intercepting voicemails.
The claimants are seeking disclosure of records from the Sun, similar to those produced by News UK for NoW. 
Anthony White QC, representing NGN, said the defendant should be given more time to present an argument against the disclosure, saying a "similar regime" at the News of the World had generated costs of £13m. "If we have to put in place a disclosure regime for the Sun going back to 1998, we would have to do so from scratch," he said.
A decision on whether the claims against the Sun can proceed to trial will be delayed until a later hearing before April.
Lawyers for those making claims against NoW said that stories produced by the paper's features section were the work of more than one individual.
The hearing comes more than a year after the former Sun editor Rebekah Brooks was cleared of all charges related to phone hacking at NoW. Brooks has since returned to become chief executive of the paper's parent company, News UK.
A spokesperson for News UK said: "Following many years of investigation, there were no charges against the Sun or its employees for voicemail interception. Today, certain claimants seeking financial settlements arising from activities at the News of the World have made unsubstantiated claims against the Sun. If the court permits such claims to proceed, the Sun will defend them vigorously."

Top Gear relaunch faces potential clash with new ITV motoring show rival; 
The Drive, featuring Louis Walsh, Mariella Frostrup, Angus Deayton and Jonny Vegas, scheduled to debut around same time as Chris Evans's take on BBC show.

Mark Sweney.

ITV's new Top Gear rival could launch against Chris Evans's take on the original BBC2 motoring show with both scheduled to debut in the coming months. 
ITV has unveiled details of its new show, called The Drive, which will see eight celebrities compete against each other in a series of races in different vehicles.
The broadcaster has signed up former Louis Walsh, Mariella Frostrup, Angus Deayton, weather presenter Laura Tobin, Jonny Vegas, singers Professor Green and Ella Eyre and former Olympic athlete Colin Jackson.
The five-part show, which will be hosted by Vernon Kay with former professional driver Jason Plato offering expert advice, is expected to air in the first half of this year. 
Chris Evans's new-look Top Gear, which has faced problems including the loss of Evans's hand-picked executive producer Lisa Clark after just five months, is to launch at the beginning of May.
While the two shows are not direct competitors, there are similarities ,with early reports about ITV's programme referring to it as a take on Top Gear's "star in a reasonably-priced car" time trial segment.
And while ITV's schedulers are yet to confirm an exact air date, Evans will certainly not appreciate a new, high-profile motoring themed show to potentially overlap and steal some of the PR thunder of his highly-anticipated relaunch of Top Gear on 8 May.
ITV's show will use a knock-out format building to a final that will involve a race with Formula 4000 racing cars. 
The programme is being made by TwoFour Productions, the company behind Splash! and The Hotel Inspector.
"Everyone thinks they can drive - but can they? This show will test not only their skills behind the wheel, but also how they control their fear," said Kay. "Drive is not just about straight line speed, all driving skills are going to be tested. But when it's not your clutch you're burning or your tyres you're shredding, it's full steam ahead."
Speaking at the Television Critics Association press tour in California last week, Evans admitted that the atmosphere at Top Gear was "apocalytpic" and "armageddon"-like when he first joined following the assault scandal that resulted in Jeremy Clarkson and ultimately his co-hosts James May and Richard Hammond and executive producer Andy Wilman leaving the show.
Evans, who is filing scenes for the show in the US, admitted the hectic schedule and pressure to reinvent the show has been something of a "baptism of fire to say the least".

Thursday's best TV: Room 101; Jericho; Busting the Drugs Millions: Brian Pern: 45 Years of Prog and Roll; The Venture Bros; Scandal; 
More Yorkshire navvy larks; David Tennant on sushi; a real-life drugs bust; and superior prog mockumentary; plus Adult Swim cartoon fun and the White House soap returns.

Jonathan Wright, Andrew Mueller, Graeme Virtue, Hannah J Davies, Paul Howlett, Ali Catterall, John Robinson.

Jericho 9pm, ITV
Episode two of writer Steve Thompson's navvy lark drama, and schoolmaster's widow Annie (Jessica Raine) and her family continue to adjust to their reduced circumstances in a frontier Yorkshire shanty town. In this, they're not helped by the unwelcome presence of railway detective Bamford (Mark Addy), who's investigating the explosion at the viaduct at the behest of landowner Charles Blackwood (Daniel Rigby). Can Annie and enigmatic Johnny Jackson (Hans Matheson) keep their dark secret? Jonathan Wright

Room 101

8.30pm, BBC1
David Tennant wants to put sushi into the titular dungeon. "It doesn't even come with chips!" "To be fair," says Frank Skinner, "you come from a place where they won't even eat raw Mars bars." Elsewhere, comedian Aisling Bea has it in for pigeons, along with adults on scooters ("like getting breastfed at 40"). But what are we to make of the rapturous applause that greets Sir Trevor McDonald's request for less queuing? Truly, the UK is going to hell in a handcart. Ali Catterall 

Busting The Drugs Millions: Inside The National Crime Agency 10pm, Channel 4
Gripping inside story of a drugs bust, illustrated with NCA documents and surveillance footage. The film recalls a nine-month operation that began with the monitoring of a single suspect and ended with dozens of officers working to dismantle one of Britain's largest criminal networks, thought to be worth at least £180m. That this is a fraction of the many billions in illegal traffic that occurs annually does not make the accomplishment, in and of itself, any less impressive. Andrew Mueller

Brian Pern: 45 Years Of Prog And Roll 10pm, BBC4
A new series of affectionate mockumentaries following Brian Pern, the erstwhile frontman of progressive rockers Thotch. In tonight's first episode, Brian unveils a radical look, courtesy of new wife Astrid (Suranne Jones), who reveals that she will soon be taking over as Brian's manager. Astrid's quest for easy money lands Brian at the Isle Of Wight festival, and also on a Thotch fan cruise, complete with celebrity auction. John Thomson gets it just right as Thotch's fan club president, Perry. John Robinson

The Venture Bros 11pm, FOX
A long-running cult in the US, this Adult Swim animated series spoofs 1960s Hanna-Barbera shows such as Jonny Quest by injecting off-colour gags, existential ennui and a barrage of pop-culture riffs. A Halloween special from 2012 might not be the best introduction to the perpetually exasperated Dr Venture and his golly-gosh sons Dean and Hank, but it's fairly representative of the show's inventiveness and fizzy wit, with the added bonus of guest star JK Simmons voicing a Lebowski-like hermit with a secret. Graeme Virtue

Scandal

10pm, Sky Living
As the fifth season of Shonda Rhimes's twisty White House soap continues, President Fitz delivers a speech so saccharine it ought to come with its own sugar tax. As he expresses regret about his affair with political fixer Olivia (Kerry Washington), he's unaware that his paramour has in fact helped her father, a murderer, break out of prison on his watch. Less improbable is tonight's main storyline, which focuses on a woman who comes to Olivia to accuse a celebrated author of sexual assault. Hannah J Davies

No cover-up, pledges Coe, as new report on athletics doping threatens more pain; 
IAAF president says he understands gravity of the issue as senior figures say crisis engulfing sport is worse than Fifa scandal.

Owen Gibson Chief sports correspondent.

Sebastian Coe, the president of world athletics' embattled governing body, will be under further pressure on Thursday as fresh allegations are outlined of widespread corruption at the heart of the sport.
The crisis facing world athletics has grown over the past two years to the level where many consider it to be worse than the turmoil enveloping Fifa that led to the downfall of Sepp Blatter, mass arrests by the US Department of Justice and a generation of executives being implicated in a $200m-plus bribery scandal.
 Related:  Sebastian Coe denies underestimating seriousness of IAAF crisis 
Dick Pound, the former president of World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada), is to present the second part of his report into systemic doping in Russia and attempted cover-ups at the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). He is among those who believe the scandal in athletics is worse because it "affects the results on the field of play" as opposed to "moving money around like the Fifa boys".
In broadcast interviews before the publication of Pound's report, which is expected to be an indictment of the role of the IAAF in the scandal, Lord Coe - who was a vice-president for seven years under the previous regime - insisted there was "no cover-up" and he had not "for one moment" regretted taking the role.
"One of the accusations is that I don't get the seriousness of this issue. I do. I am dealing with it every day and have been dealing with this since effectively I took over as president," he told CNN.
Last week, senior figures at the IAAF - including the son of Coe's predecessor and the head of the anti-doping unit - were banned, along with the head of the Russian athletics federation, following an ethics commission investigation that showed in shocking detail how they had attempted to subvert the testing system and extort money from the marathon runner Liliya Shobukhova.
Since well before Coe took over in August, there has been a series of revelations linking the systemic doping in Russia, which saw the country banned from competition in the wake of Pound's first report, to cover-ups and corruption at the IAAF's headquarters in Monaco.
The Guardian revealed this week that Papa Massata Diack, who acted as a marketing consultant for the IAAF, had apparently sent an email to International Olympic Committee members in 2008 arranging for "parcels" to be delivered to senior IOC members, while the French newspaper Le Monde claimed he had paid $50,000 in cash to Gabriel Dolle, the former head of the IAAF's anti-doping unit, to keep quiet about positive tests.
 Related:  Fifa and IAAF endure grim 2015 but corruption crises far from over
A large leak of documents to the Associated Press this week showed senior IAAF officials knew as long ago as 2009 that the Russian blood doping was so serious that athletes risked dying and that Diack was warned in September 2012 that 42% of Russian elite athletes were doping.
Before the press conference in Munich, Pound said: "The second report will consist of the possible criminal actions on the part of individuals, in response to the generalised claim that the IAAF did not follow up on positive test results."
When the Sunday Times and German broadcaster ARD made those claims in the summer, Coe insisted they amounted to a "war on my sport". But he has faced a barrage of criticism over his handling of the crisis and questions about what he knew and when. The former London 2012 chairman and double Olympic gold medallist was also forced to give up his ambassadorial role at Nike after he admitted allegations of a conflict of interest had become an unwanted distraction.
After Pound presents the second report, after the first in November blew the lid on systemic state-sponsored doping in Russia, the French financial prosecutor Eliane Houlette will take the unusual step of delivering an update on an ongoing criminal investigation.
Also in November, the former IAAF president Lamine Diack, Papa Massata Diack's father, was arrested over allegations that he accepted more than (EURO)1m in bribes to cover up doping violations. His legal adviser, Habib Cisse, and Dolle were also arrested, while French prosecutors said Papa Massata Diack, Lamine's son who acted as a marketing consultant for the IAAF for eight years with a focus on developing markets, was told he would be questioned if he set foot in France.
Papa Massata Diack was last week banned for life from the sport and Dolle, who the Guardian revealed had stepped down from his role last year amid an ethics investigation, was banned for five years following an investigation by the IAAF's independent ethics commission.
Coe, who delivered a glowing tribute to Lamine Diack when he succeeded him in August, calling him his "spiritual president", has said he was shocked by the involvement of the 82-year-old Senegalese in the corruption allegations. He has argued that his role as vice-president was limited to just 10 days of active duty a year and that his focus until 2012 was entirely on delivering the London Olympics.
Much of the pressure on Coe stems from whether he should have questioned more closely the scale of the Russian doping crisis, which was being openly discussed in IAAF circles, and from his previous loyalty to Lamine Diack.
His supporters point to his role in setting up the independent ethics committee that revealed the scale of the Russian cover-up and argue, that without Lamine Diack's support he would never have been able to win the presidency and the current situation would be even worse. Pound said in his report that the London Games was "sabotaged" by Russian doping and the participation of athletes who should have been banned.
The internal documents leaked this week to the Associated Press showed how Cisse and Dolle considered covering up Russian tests ahead of the Games.
"Our sport is a strong sport," insisted Coe on Wednesday. "Don't run away with the idea that I don't know these are dark days. Of course they're dark days."
Pound, who also criticised Wada in his first report, is expected to recommend inquiries into the scale of doping in other countries such as Kenya and Turkey.
Renee Anne Shirley, the former head of the Jamaican Anti-Doping Commission and a trenchant critic of the IAAF's handling the issue, said it would be "interesting seeing Coe's continued tired defence of his sport" and believed it had "lost the moral high ground".

Legal action launched against 7-Eleven owner who allegedly underpaid $31,500; 
Fair Work ombudsman acts against Brisbane franchisee who allegedly underpaid staff by paying flat rate of $17.74 an hour rather than penalty rates.

Shalailah Medhora.

Legal action has been launched against the owner of two 7-Eleven franchises who allegedly underpaid staff by $31,500 by denying them penalty rates. 
The Fair Work ombudsman has launched the legal action on behalf of 21 employees of the two Brisbane stores - many of whom are international students - claiming they have been underpaid between $98 and $5080.

A franchisee, Jason Yuan, allegedly paid employees a flat rate of $17.74 an hour, even if they worked on Sundays, late nights and public holidays. He is liable for up to $10,200 for each breach.
The two stores were targeted in surprise, late-night visits by the ombudsman, who has warned Yuan in the past of his obligation to pay penalty rates. 
He will appear before the federal circuit court in Brisbane on 11 February.
Yuan will become the sixth operator of the convenience store chain to appear before the court since 2009.
In August an investigation by Fairfax papers and the ABC found that 7-Eleven underpaid two-thirds of its workers, some receiving only $10 an hour. The minimum wage is $17.29 an hour.
A spokeswoman for the 7-Eleven said in a statement in August: "7-Eleven strongly supports the Fair Work ombudsman's investigation into employees' pay and conditions currently under way at a select number of franchisees' stores."
The Greens have called for a Senate inquiry into the exploitation of the convenience store workers.

Supreme court to revisit corruption conviction of former Virginia governor; 
Bob McDonnell and his wife were convicted of taking gifts and loans from a businessman in exchange for promoting his company's dietary supplement.

David Smith in Washington.

Disgraced former Virginia governor Bob McDonnell's hopes of avoiding prison time were boosted on Friday, when the US supreme court agreed to hear his appeal against corruption convictions.

McDonnell, once a high-flying Republican politician, and his wife, Maureen, were convicted in 2014 of taking $177,000 in gifts and loans from a businessman, Jonnie Williams, in a trial that lifted the lid on the couple's financial and marital troubles.  
McDonnell was sentenced to two years in prison, but the supreme court last year agreed that he would not have to report there until his appeals process was complete. The court is expected to hear the case in the coming months and rule by the end of June.
"I am very grateful to the US supreme court for its decision today to hear my case," McDonnell said on Friday. 
"I am innocent of these crimes and ask the court to reverse these convictions. I maintain my profound confidence in God's grace to sustain me and my family, and thank my friends and supporters across the country for their faithfulness over these past three years."
McDonnell, 61, an ex-army officer and state attorney general, served as Virginia governor from 2010 to 2014, a noted champion of family values. In 2010 he delivered the Republican reply to President Obama's state of the union address. Two years later, he was rumoured to be in contention to be Mitt Romney's vice-presidential running mate.
His fall from grace was swift. During a trial in Virginia's state capital, Richmond, prosecutors described a lavish lifestyle the McDonnells enjoyed thanks to gifts and sweetheart loans from Williams that included holidays, designer clothing and shoes, a Rolex watch, $15,000 for their daughter's wedding and more.
In an attempt to rebut the charges, McDonnell's defence contended that he could not have conspired with his wife because their marriage had in fact collapsed.
Nevertheless McDonnell was convicted of 11 corruption counts including conspiracy, bribery and extortion for taking the loans and gifts in exchange for promoting a dietary supplement made by Williams's company, Star Scientific.
The Richmond-based 4th US circuit court of appeals upheld McDonnell's conviction last July, but his lawyers contend that in doing so it used an overly broad definition of bribery, penalising the type of actions that many elected officials carry out on behalf of constituents. 
They argue that the former governor's conduct did not constitute "official action" in exchange for a thing of value, as required for conviction under federal bribery law. The actions in question "were limited to routine political courtesies: arranging meetings, asking questions and attending events," the lawyers wrote in court papers asking the supreme court to hear his appeal.
"This is the first time in our history that a public official has been convicted of corruption despite never agreeing to put a thumb on the scales of any government decision," they wrote.
On behalf of the US government, solicitor-general Donald Verrilli responded in court papers that the convictions were based on "the unexceptionable proposition that a public official violates federal corruption statutes where, as here, he accepts personal benefits in exchange for his agreement to influence government matters".

McDonnell is supported by both Democratic and Republican former officials including ex-attorney generals Michael Mukasey and John Ashcroft and Gregory Craig, former counsel to Obama. They wrote: "The law should not be broadened to subject government officials to the threat of prosecution for engaging in innocent conduct that occurs on a routine basis."
The court declined to examine a second issue raised by McDonnell: whether the trial judge did enough to ensure jurors could remain impartial despite the coverage of the case in Virginia media.
McDonnell's wife was found guilty of nine criminal counts and received a one-year sentence. Her appeal has been put on hold until the supreme court decides her husband's case. 
Prosecutors granted Williams immunity from prosecution, in exchange for his cooperation.

Two Test players under investigation in South Africa for match-fixing; 
∑ 47 players and staff have been questioned over Ram Slam allegations ∑ Retired Gulam Bodi named as suspected 'intermediary' on Thursday.

Ali Martin in Johannesburg.

Investigators looking into the corruption scandal that has engulfed South African cricket are understood to have spoken to 47 players and staff in the country, with two active former Test cricketers among those believed to have been involved. 
The retired one-day all-rounder Gulam Bodi was named by Cricket South Africa on Thursday as the 'intermediary' alleged to have been the ringleader of the scam, which took place during the Ram Slam Twenty20 competition before Christmas.

The number of individuals contacted in the evidence gathering process over the past month shows the size of the investigation by anti-Corruption officials, with some of those spoken to now facing charges of failing to report wrongdoing during the tournament.
Bodi, who played three limited overs matches for South Africa in 2007 and stopped playing last year, is cooperating with officials but CSA is now understood to be investigating at least two more former internationals who are still playing professionally although they are not involved in South Africa's current Test series against England.
Those found to have manipulated matches could face possible jail sentences if criminal cases are pursued, with match-fixing illegal in South Africa under the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act Law.
The law, which contains a clause for sporting events, was passed in 2004, four years after the former captain Hansie Cronje was banned for life ban for his role in match-fixing.

Mexico's beleaguered president seizes on El Chapo's arrest to lift gloom; 
A recent outburst of violence highlights that the rule of law is largely absent - an issue that could soon be compounded by lower oil prices and peso devaluation.

David Agren in Mexico City.

Two days after fugitive cartel kingpin JoaquÌn "El Chapo" Guzm·n was apprehended by Mexican marines, President Enrique PeÒa Nieto took to the airwaves to boast about the capture of a man whose two escapes from high-security prisons had come to symbolize institutional failure and corruption in the country. 
"The detention of the world's most wanted criminal confirms the coordination of our institutions in favor of the rule of law," said PeÒa Nieto.  
But a stream of news reports over recent days have offered a rough reminder that the rule of law - even a semblance of security - is absent from much of Mexico. 
Over the weekend 17 people were abducted by gunmen as they travelled to a wedding; on Tuesday, five teachers were snatched from their school by kidnappers who are demanding a ransom. Both incidents took place in the violence-racked state of Guerrero - once best known for the beaches and glamour of Acapulco, but now notorious for the kidnap and presumed murder of 43 teacher trainees in 2014. 
And a reminder of Mexico's endemic political corruption came on Friday, when a former head of PeÒa Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary party - and one-time ally of the president - was arrested in Spain as part of a money-laundering investigation. Humberto Moreira, who was detained at Madrid airport, resigned in 2012 after a debt scandal was uncovered in Coahuila, the state he had previously governed.
Moreira's former state finance secretary pleaded guilty in Texas to federal money laundering charges in 2014 and the man who replaced him as interim governor is also wanted in the United States on suspicion of embezzling millions.
Recapturing Mexico's most wanted man was a much-needed boost for PeÒa Nieto, who has proved intensely aware of his international image since taking office in 2012.. The administration had previously stayed silent on issues of security, preferring instead to talk up an agenda of economic reforms. 
Analysts say the response to the recapture and the president's sudden propensity to speak on security issues reflects a shift in approach, but also a chilly economic climate, with a plunging peso and falling oil price.
"In simple language, he said: we're going back to the policies of [PeÒa Nieto's predecessor Felipe] CalderÛn," said Il·n Semo, political historian at the Iberoamerican University. 
 Related:  Young, idealistic - and dead: the Mexican mayor gunned down on her second day
The new year began with the horrific murder of small-town mayor Gisela Mota on her second day in office. Yet PeÒa Nieto insists the security situation is improving, with crime falling 12% during his three years in office and the incidence of extortion, kidnap and homicides tumbling too. The president also insists his reformers are producing results in areas such as telecommunications, education and energy, as Mexicans put less money into billionaire Carlos Slim 's pocket for cellular service and pay less for gasoline. 
But not everyone is convinced, especially by the president's positive portrayal of the country's security institutions - mentioned often in speeches after El Chapo's arrest. 
 "They can find El Chapo but not 43 missing students," groused leftist leader AndrÈs Manuel LÛpez Obrador.
Polls show confidence in institutions such as the army, police and politicians crashed after the attacks on the Ayotzinapa students. Ironically, a poll in Reforma showed 31% of Mexicans think worse of PeÒa Nieto's administration after the El Chapo arrest.
"There's such an environment of mistrust that nothing is to be believed," said Federico EstÈvez, political science professor at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico. 
The increased security talk comes as Mexico confronts low prices for oil - the country's principal export and critical for funding social spending. Current prices barely cover the cost of production, said veteran Mexican energy observer George Baker.
The peso has plunged to record lows too - not the fault of PeÒa Nieto, who called Mexico the "economic engine" of Latin America, but an issue with the potential to prompt unrest in Mexico nevertheless.
"Crises always come accompanied by big devaluations," said Semo. "Devaluation in Mexico means an eroding of political order, the president's capacity."

A steady stream of leaks - an old strategy in Mexico of trying cases of unpopular persons in the press - has kept El Chapo on the front pages, along with Sean Penn and actress Kate del Castillo. Unseemly stories of a lovesick drug baron done in by an infatuation with a soap opera starlet are among the leaks, though some columnists see this as no coincidence suggest Del Castillo is under serious scrutiny. 
It's a story likely to stay in the media as a tricky 2016 progresses.
"The problems for the actor Kate del Castillo," wrote well-sourced columnist Raymundo Riva Palacio, "are only getting started."

VW sales lag behind wider EU market; 
European car sales 9.3% higher in 2015, while VW sales rose 6.1%.

Gwyn Topham.

Volkswagen has fallen behind its competitors in Europe after the scandal-hit German carmaker failed to keep pace with an industry-wide sales increase of almost 10% last year.  
The European Union saw 13.7m car sales last year, 9.3% more than in 2014. However, sales of Volkswagen cars rose 6.1% over the same period as the company, which has admitted rigging diesel emissions tests, lost ground to its peers. 
The European carmakers' association, the ACEA, said last month's sales alone were up 17% on the previous December, the highest uplift during the market's 28-month recovery after the depths of the financial crisis. But the ACEA noted that the overall numbers were still only now back at 2010 figures, despite the growth. 
Car sales, viewed as a barometer of consumer confidence, were up in all the five big EU markets, with Spain (21%) and Italy (16%) posting the strongest growth. Sales were up 6% in the UK, whose own market recovery preceded the wider EU's, largely due to cheap financing deals. Last week the UK trade body, the SMMT, announced the fourth year of annual growth and a record number of passenger car registrations. 
Volkswagen's sales performance pushed its market share down to 22.5% in December, from 24.7% in the same month in 2014. Sales for all the group's brands - which also include Audi, Seat and Skoda - rose 4.7% in December, some way below the overall rate of new registrations, although the German giant remains by far the biggest player in the European market. 
Volkswagen admitted fitting "defeat devices" to 11m vehicles worldwide to cheat tests for nitrogen oxides pollution, which could cost VW billions of dollars in fines and compensation in the US, although it has indicated it will resist similar moves in Europe.
Other manufacturers saw sales rise strongly in December, particularly French rivals PSA Group, whose numbers increased by 21.4%, and Renault, up 28%. However, Renault's shares have fallen this week, following rumours that it could also be drawn directly into the emissions scandal.
Analysts have forecast that falling fuel prices could boost car sales further in 2016 as the price of motoring drops.

Mexico caught El Chapo, again. But he'll likely live to escape another day; 
Cartel boss JoaquÌn Guzm·n knows Mexican corruption better than anyone, because he lives or dies - escapes or remains imprisoned - by it.

Daniel PeÒa.

Though President Enrique PeÒa Nieto has announced "Mission accomplished" following news of JoaquÌn "El Chapo" Guzm·n's recapture Friday, I'm actually very excited for the drug cartel kingpin's next escape. 
As the trajectory goes, we can expect it to be even more fabulous than his last, more intricately planned and executed than even the tunnel get-away in which Guzm·n burrowed his way out of maximum security prison - Shawshank Redemption style - through his jail cell's shower and rode a motor bike through a lighted underground tunnel to freedom a mile away.
In the spirit of radical honesty I'll say this: that was awesome. Almost a national day of pride for Mexican people everywhere because the story was so ridiculous, so far-fetched (but somehow real), that it could have only happened in Mexico, facilitated by Mexican corruption. It was both laughably tragic and deliciously schadenfreude. Guzm·n became the populist hero who could clown the party in power harder than anyone could clown them while using their own weapon against them, no less: the refined art of Mexican corruption. 
Mexican corruption has created Chapo Guzm·n, our Mexican James Bond, Robin Hood, Jesus Malverde and Bogeyman all rolled into one. And like any great legend, he'll continue to exist (despite or in spite of PeÒa Nieto's wishes) because both Mexicans and Americans need him to exist. Sure, America needs its drugs. But more than that, America needs its drug war, of which El Chapo is the face and this new era of hyper-rampant Mexican corruption symptom. Chapo knows Mexican corruption better than anyone, because he lives or dies by it. He escapes or doesn't escape by it.
The tradition of Mexican corruption is how Guzm·n made his first escape from the notorious Puente Grande prison in January of 2001 despite having been assigned at least two prison guards in addition to extra surveillance cameras on him at all times. It has been speculated that Guzm·n bribed prison guards to dismantle surveillance cameras in order to better smuggle him outside of the prison in a laundry cart.
From there, he rode a truck to an undisclosed location to continue operating his massive Sinaloa Cartel empire, arguably the most powerful cartel-in both capital and fire power - in all of Mexico. It's evident, too, that corruption facilitated Guzm·n's second escape from the Altiplano high-security prison outside of Mexico City, in which the prison's CCTV shows guards unresponsive to the racket accompanying the massive construction project that would facilitate Guzm·n's departure only months after his capture in February 2014. 
                     In the meanwhile, PeÒa Nieto will likely try to sell Chapo Guzm·n's latest capture as a win for the administration. PeÒa Nieto will try to show to the world that his administration can, and will be, tough on crime (never mind the Grupo Higa scandal, in which the president was cleared of charges that he improperly purchased property from public contractors, or the "historical truth" - the administration's shifting story - concerning the missing Ayotzinapa students). 
He'll probably talk about the systematic corruption in Mexico and draw a line between the Mexican government and criminals themselves. He'll even likely try to proclaim some vague victory over cartel influence in Mexico. But let's remember how El Chapo escapes time after time: the collusion of organized crime with public officials. 
As security analyst Jorge Kawas told the Guardian : "Some powerful people in the (Mexican) elite should be worried if El Chapo decides to spill the beans." The gears will turn. Systematic corruption will continue. And Chapo will escape once again. Only this time, I hope there will be an airplane involved.

Press regulator Impress ready to reveal its first 'clients'; 
Body independent of the industry soon to announce publishers' identities.

Roy Greenslade.

                     Impress, the alternative press regulator, is about to get its act together. It will announce on Wednesday (20 January) the identities of its first "clients", the publishers that have agreed to be regulated by it.  
At the same time, the body's chair, Walter Merricks, will announce the timing of Impress's application to the Press Recognition Panel (PRP). 
He will reveal the details before giving a speech at the London School of Economics on the future of press regulation.
Impress has also recruited two new members for its board: Martin Hickman is the former deputy news editor of the Independent and the Press Association's Westminster correspondent. He is co-author (with Tom Watson) of a book about the phone-hacking scandal, Dial M for Murdoch, and now runs a publishing company. 
                     Emma Jones  is a former Sun columnist, deputy editor of the paper's Bizarre column at the Sun, and a news and features writer at the Sunday Mirror. 
Impress is entirely independent of the publishing industry and is the alternative to the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso), which is funded by newspaper and magazine publishers.
Ipso regards signing up to the PRP, which was set up following parliament's creation of the royal charter on press regulation, as a threat to press freedom.
Impress believes that there is no such threat and that publishers who come under the PRP's umbrella will enjoy certain legal protections. 
At present, three major publisher of national titles - the Guardian, Independent and Financial Times - have not signed up to regulation by either Ipso or Impress.
However, journalists at all three, as well as their Sunday stablemates and the London Evening Standard, abide by the editors' code of practice.

 US industrial production down for third month  
The US industrial production data are also bad. Output fell for the third month in a row, by 0.4% in December, after a downwardly revised 0.9% decline in November. Production was held back by a strong dollar and cutbacks made by energy firms in the wake of plunging oil prices.
Taken together with the worse-than-expected retail sales figures, they paint a worse economic picture in the last three months of 2015.

Steve Murphy, US economist at  Capital Economics, said the retail sales figures point to fourth-quarter GDP growth of 1% annualised. 
All things considered, it doesn't appear that the record warm temperatures in December or the latest downward leg in gasoline prices are boosting spending in any meaningful way. We now estimate that real consumption growth was a disappointing 1.5% to 2% annualized in the fourth quarter, with overall GDP growth at an even weaker 1%."

Neil Saunders, who heads up retail consultants Conlumino, said retail sales were held back by discounting and a lacklustre performance of many key holiday categories. Retailers had to work hard to persuade consumers to spend money.
There are a number of explanations for the December pure retail number not being higher. The first of these is that the comparative from last year was fairly tough... 
A relatively weak product line up in electricals failed to capture consumer interest, resulting in a sales decline of around 3.5% in December; and although sales picked up the latter end of the month, clothing also put in a lackluster performance thanks to warmer than average weather. 
The third and final factor is discounting, which was more widespread and deeper this year than last: while this probably helped to stimulate some spending activity, it did not result in huge volume uplifts; as such, the net effect was to dampen overall sales growth."
He sums up 2015 thus: 
Retail is now best described as being in a state of respectable but constrained growth. Despite consumer finances improving and despite consumers having more money to spend this is not consistently finding its way into cash registers. Retailers are having to work increasingly hard to persuade consumers to part with their cash."
block-time published-time 2.12pm GMT 
US retail sales for December were disappointing, said ING economist Rob Carnell, who found the figures somewhat puzzling.
There is no single explanation for the weakness. Warmer than usual weather may heve reduced spending on seasonal clothing, but doesn't explain why auto sales were so much at odds with other auto sales data which are very strong. Falling electronics sales are also hard to explain, as is food, miscellaneous sales, and general merchandise."

 Factory gate prices also fell in December, by 0.2%, reflecting sharp drops in energy costs, according to the US Labor Department. This could dampen expectations that inflation will rise towards the Federal Reserve's 2% target. 
Over 2015 as a whole, producer prices fell 1%, the weakest reading since the series started in 2010.

 US retail sales disappoint in December  
US retail sales slipped 0.1% in December, wrongfooting economists who had forecast no change. Unusually warm weather meant retailers struggled to shift winter clothes, and cheaper gasoline dragged down sales at service stations.
The November retail sales figure was revised higher to 0.4%, the US Commerce Department said. 
More worryingly, retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services (which can be volatile), fell 0.3% last month, following a 0.5% rise in November.

 Royal Bank of Scotland chairman Howard Davies has put the probability of Britain exiting the European Union at 35% in an interview with Bloomberg Television. 
This probability assessment is based on a review of all the polls and also reflects what RBS economists think, Davies said.
You cannot be sure how a referendum like this can go, the polls currently will tell you that there's a small majority in favour of remaining, but it's a very volatile environment. 
And what the polls also will tell you is that the thing people most worry about is immigration in some form, and of course if you had a referendum at a time when immigration was in the news, when the evening bulletins were full of boats across the Atlantic, or there was some great terrorist attack attributed to migrants, this could affect public opinion a lot. 
So I think there will be all kinds that will play into that decision when it comes which will not be fully rational based on an analysis of the impact on the City of London."
On China's economic slowdown, he said:
We're adjusting to that changed role of the Chinese economy, or changed growth rate, and of course the peripheral economies around China which will be affected in the same kind of way."
Here are the key points of the interview:

Brexit: "35% probability"
His pessimism about UK / European investment banking
Downsizing of RBS investment bank is "going well"
Banks are more constrained in bets they can take
There's an adjustment to Chinese growth
There are "fault lines" in world economy
Davies also talked about his lunch with David Bowie, who died on Sunday, and Iggy Pop in east Berlin in the 1970s:
[Bowie] was worried about travelling around east Berlin as he was, and so he approached the British authorities. And as it happened, a friend of mine was in the British Embassy in east Berlin, and I was staying there for the weekend. And we escorted him around in a British diplomatic car and had lunch in the Bertolt Brecht restaurant."

The Institute of Directors has sent us their response to the news that two former bosses of the Co-operative Bank, including its ex-CEO, have been banned from holding senior positions in the City.
Simon Walker, director general of the IoD, said there was " clearly also a failure on the part of the whole board". 
This is further proof that the leadership of the Co-operative Bank in the run up to its spectacular failure was woefully lacking in the skills, knowledge, and decision-making needed for a major financial institution. It is stark reminder that even brands which carry a positive public reputation can have it snatched away from them if their corporate governance isn't up to scratch.
Non-executive directors are there to constructively challenge executives on their actions. Where they do not, as at the Co-op, it can be to the great detriment of the organisation's employees and customers. The Co-op traded on its reputation as an ethical and reliable bank, but while senior executives and the board may have believed their own hype, they manifestly failed to embody these principles, with devastating results."
The IoD believes training for non-executives, including trustees of charities and third sector organisations, is vital for good governance and holding executives to account. It is launching a new course for charity trustees on May.

 Russia has poured cold water on the idea of co-ordinated oil output cuts with Opec, the oil cartel, to prop up plunging oil prices. Brent crude is holding below the $30 a barrel mark on Friday, down 4% on the day. A global oil glut has pushed prices more than 70% lower over the past 18 months.
Russian energy minister Alexander Novak said it is unlikely that such cuts would be agreed, adding that they would "not be efficient" in any case.
The RIA news agency quoted Novak as saying in an interview with RBC TV:
From our point of view, it is unlikely that all the countries within OPEC can agree on production cuts, let alone those countries which are not in the Opec coalition.
Such consultations have been underway for the past year and a half since oil prices started to fall in mid-2014. [But] we see that in 2015 countries like Saudi Arabia in Opec have increased total production by 1.5m barrels per day."
Last month's Opec meeting ended without an agreement on how to shore up oil prices and some members of the cartel urged Russia to reduce its own output.
In the past, Russia has argued that its harsh climate makes it hard to restart production once wells have been closed.

In the 35 years since the actor and singer Jane Birkin sat next to Hermes' boss Jean-Louis Dumas on a plane and complained about not being able to find a good leather weekend bag, the Birkin bag has beaten returns for gold and the benchmark US S&P 500 index, according to the luxury bag retail site Baghunter.

 Brent crude at a 12-year low  
Back to oil, which is still below $30 a barrel. It hit $29.73 at one stage, the lowest since February 2004, and is now trading at $29.89 a barrel. 
The International Atomic Energy Agency could issue its report on Iran's compliance with an agreement to rein in its nuclear programme during a meeting in Vienna on Friday, whereupon western sanctions could be lifted and open the door to more oil supply from Iran. The country's oil exports are already on track to hit a nine-month high in January, at 1.1m barrels a day.
Analysts at Commerzbank said:
With sanctions on Iran likely to be lifted, more oil is flooding the markets. Although the additional supply had been imminent for some time, current sentiment ought to send prices further south."
They cut their 2016 forecast for oil prices to $50 per barrel for Brent by the end of the year, down from a previous forecast of $63.

 Sterling hits 5 1/2 year low against dollar  
Sterling has hit a 5 1/2 year low against the dollar again, as traders are growing doubtful over Britain's economic outlook and the timing of the first rate hike - which some don't expect until early next year - and fears over "Brexit" intensify.
Prime minister David Cameron has promised a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU by the end of 2017, but it may come as early as June this year. Volatility in markets is likely to increase in the run-up to the poll.
The pound slipped 0.5% to $1.4337 earlier, its weakest level since May 2016. It has lost more than 6% in the past six months. It also lost ground against the euro. The euro rose 0.7% to 75p, not far off a one-year high of 76.06p it hit on Thursday.

 The Bank of England said that British banks saw a notable rise in demand for personal loans and other unsecured credit in late 2015, and this is expected to continue into this year. 
The Bank's credit conditions survey said banks were awarding more unsecured lending to households as lenders' appetite for risk grew.
The increase in unsecured credit availability appeared particularly apparent in other unsecured lending, such as personal loans, where credit scoring criteria were reported to have loosened."
The latest data show that net unsecured consumer credit climbed to £1.5bn in November from £1.2bn in October, taking it to its highest level since February 2008.  It was the ninth month running that unsecured consumer credit had been over £1bn.

 Greece's European lenders likely to start reform review next week  
Greece's European lenders are expected to start a review of Athens' reform programme next week, although talks on debt relief may still be several months away.
Before those talks start, Greece needs to conclude a first review of reforms agreed last summer under its third bailout programme with its lenders, which include the EU executive and the International Monetary Fund.
European Commission vice president Valdis Dombrovskis said in an interview with Greek daily Kathimerini:
We are ready to the start the review as soon as possible, most likely next week. But we are not setting any time limit for when the review should be concluded."
Dombrovskis said that to secure a positive progress review, Greece needs to implement pension reform, set up a new privatisation fund and find ways of achieving primary budget surpluses for 2016 to 2018.
He said:
If Greece concludes the review, it will show it is serious with its promises, its programme is on track and this would be a very positive step so that stability is restored."
Greece and some eurozone officials have said the review could be finished next month, but Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the chairman of eurozone finance ministers, cautioned on Thursday that it could be months rather than weeks.
Greece's finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos believes an agreement could be reached within four weeks. He has been touring eurozone capitals to explain the reforms and drum up support for an early conclusion to the review.
Dombrovskis said the European Commission is assuming that the IMF will once again be part of the bailout. The Washington-based fund provided financing for Greece's first two bailouts in 2010 and 2012. But IMF chief Christine Lagarde has said that the fund will probably only decide in the spring whether to take part in the third bailout.
She told Germany's S¸ddeutsche Zeitung that the issues of debt sustainability and progress on pension reforms will be key.
It is clear that pension reform is the trigger that will prove that Greece's economic position is improving."
The IMF has not provided any aid to Athens since August 2014 under a previous programme that is due to expire next March.

Independent City analyst Nick Bubb says about BonmarchÈ,  which already lowered its profit estimates in mid-December and stuck to that guidance on Friday:
Back on Dec 16 th, poor old BonmarchÈ was one of the first fashion retailers to warn that trading conditions during November and early December had been very challenging and since then that story has been well played out. 
 Interestingly, however, Beth Butterwick, (the soon-to-be-departed CEO), says: " In the short period since Christmas, demand has trended towards more normal levels " (which bears out the message from the recent John Lewis sales figures."
The latest John Lewis figures out this morning were strong, showing sales rising 15.6% last week year-on-year (against a sluggish week a year ago), driven by electrical goods (up 18.8%) and fashion (15.4%). Online sales were also strong, rising nearly 26%.

 Corporate round-up  
After Thursday's flurry of retail news, Friday is much quieter. Here's a round-up of the main corporate news.
 The competition regulator has given the final clearance for BT's contentious £12.5bn takeover of EE, Britain's largest mobile phone network, reports Sean Farrell.  You can read more here.
The Competition and Markets Authority said it did not expect the takeover to lead to a substantial reduction in competition or detriment to consumers in any market in the UK, including mobile and broadband services.
It said there was little overlap between BT's mainly fixed phone, broadband and pay-TV business and EE's mobile phone operation. The merger was also unlikely to make things worse for other operators using BT's network.
 UK housebuilder Bovis Homes is leading gains on the FTSE 250 index, rising 3.4% to 953p, after posting record profits for 2015. The company delivered 3,934 homes last year, which represents an increase of over 8% from 2014. The average selling price rose 7% to £231,000. Like its peers, Bovis is confident about the housing market, which is underpinned by government-backed initiatives such as help to buy.
 H&M said it had a good December, with sales up 10% year-on-year. In November, mild weather in north America and Europe put customers off buying winter clothing at the Swedish retailer and sales rose only 4%.
 BonmarchÈ, the UK bargain fashion retailer who targets women over 50, fared less well. Like-for-like sales were down 1.3% in the quarter to 26 December.

Simon Smith, chief economist at broker FxPro, says 2016 so far has been a "terrible year for global stock markets".
According to unofficial theory a 20% decline in a stock index means that it has entered an official bear market and we saw this from the Shanghai Composite overnight following another 3.5% loss. The end of the week in Asia has seen emerging markets record their third weekly loss in a row and the same can be said for some European markets. 
This is now starting to be reflected in profit forecasts for S&P companies across the pond where we're seeing the most downgrades to earnings compared to upgrades since 2009. Crude prices are also lower overnight but for all the talk about whether oil will fall to $20 or whether it won't we have to remember that commodities entered their massive bear market by the 20% measure as far back as 2014."

This means that the Shanghai Composite index, which recorded its lowest close since December 2014, is now in a bear market. It has lost more than 20% from its recent high on 22 December. A bear market is defined as a drop of 20% or more from a recent high.

 VW market share in Europe falls for first time since 2007  
European car sales figures are out. They show that Volkswagen's market share in Europe fell last year for the first time since 2007 as the emissions rigging scandal took its toll.
VW accounted for 24.8% of new cars sold in Europe compared with 25.5% in 2014, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association in Brussels.
The industry as a whole had a good year, with sales jumping 9.2% to a six-year high of 14.2m vehicles, compared with VW's 6.2% increase.
Europe's biggest carmaker has lost ground to rivals such as Fiat Chrysler, BMW and Daimler since the scandal broke in mid-September and put consumers off buying its cars. Bloomberg has all the details.

The market is bracing itself for more supply from Iran. Western sanctions on the country are expected to be lifted within days, after a historic nuclear deal with Tehran was reached last summer.
Brent is heading for a weekly loss of about 10%. Mining giant BHP Billiton has been forced to write down the value of its onshore American oil and gas assets by more than 30% in the wake of the slump in crude oil prices.
Fresh pressure on oil prices and poor Chinese lending data pushed Asian stocks to 3 1/2 year lows on Friday. 
New lending by Chinese banks was weaker than expected in December and well down on the previous month. Banks extended 597.8bn yuan ($90.76bn) of new loans in the final month of 2015, fuelling concerns that Beijing's efforts to boost borrowing via monetary easing are not transmitting to the real economy.
Li Huiyong, an economist at Shenyin & Wanguo Securities in Shanghai, said:
The fall in new yuan loans showed there was little demand for investment and reflected sluggish economic performance in the real economy."

                     The Revenant                   
There have been epic wilderness westerns before, but none quite as epic or wild as this. At times it's so viscerally real and outrageously grand, you can't quite believe what you're seeing, let alone imagine how they did it - not least the already-infamous bear-attack scene. That show-stopping mauling sets Leonardo DiCaprio's fur trapper on a purgatorial cross-country survival/revenge mission through a freezing cold gamut of frontier adversities, natural and human. The story, based on a true account, is pretty old-fashioned at heart, but the execution is state of the art. SR

(Jerwood Theatres At The Royal Court, London, Thursday to 12 March)
Attempting to preview a new Caryl Churchill work is a hiding to nothing, given the secrecy that always accompanies it. All we know about Escaped Alone is that it concerns four women - played by Linda Bassett, Deborah Findlay, Kika Markham and June Watson - tea and a "catastrophe". We do know that the piece will be - like most of her later works - short (at about an hour), and probably divisive. That was the case with Here We Go (45 minutes about death) at the National Theatre late last year, described as "sheer tedium" by one critic but dubbed "unforgettable" by another. Whatever transpires, the 77-year-old writer of Top Girls, who has tackled such diverse subjects as 80s bankers and human cloning, remains a landmark voice in British theatre. MC

(Arnolfini, Bristol, Sat)  
Once a 1980s radical, now an OBE-holder, documentary-maker and artist John Akomfrah is one of British film's greats. Born in Ghana, bred in the UK, he's made deeply political, staggeringly beautiful movies since the early 80s, when he co-founded the Black Audio Film Collective, a group who melded avant garde movie-making techniques with stories of diaspora life. Thirty years after he made the landmark Handsworth Songs, a meditative yet searing Channel 4 film about the riots that exploded in Birmingham and London in 1985, his themes of migration, memory and the relationships between the old colonial powers and the developing world have never been more pressing. Vertigo Sea, a three-screen feature about oceans and the people who travel on them, is coming to Bristol's Arnolfini gallery this week (Sat to 10 Apr) after debuting at 2015's Venice Biennale. Shot in Norway, the Isle of Skye and the Faroe Islands with help from the BBC's natural history unit, it's one of the few responses to anti-migrant hysteria to involve jellyfish, 18th-century frock coats and Moby Dick. To coincide, he'll be speaking here to writer Anthony Downey. CJ

For years, Isy Suttie was one of the London circuit's hidden treasures - an unassuming, occasionally guitar-wielding comic offering gentle but wonderfully crafted stories about her idiosyncratic upbringing in Matlock. Then she got an unexpected break with a part in Peep Show, in which she played offbeat love interest Dobby. Now she has the task of introducing her own established comic voice to new audiences, who'll be more familiar with the sight of her repeatedly breaking Mark Corrigan's heart than telling jokes. The Actual One ties in with the newly published book of the same name (her first), a tale of a delayed rite of passage that's becoming increasingly common: finding you've turned 30, and deciding this is probably the point where you should start becoming an adult.

The mechanics and dynamics of silent comedy didn't die with the advent of the talkies - just look at last year's Shaun The Sheep Movie. A breadth of remit allows this silent and classic comedy film festival to stray beyond the confines of early cinema, although it always manages to find more of that out there. New (re)discoveries this year include Mancunian comedies (from the studio once known as "Jollywood"), silent westerns and a Soviet menage a trois. In addition you get sound-assisted slapstick such as Cary Grant's breakthrough The Awful Truth (introduced by comedian Lucy Porter), and guests including Stephen Merchant, Ken Dodd, Tim Vine (on Sgt Bilko), and Marcus Brigstocke in conversation with the makers of Shaun The Sheep. And if all else fails, you can't go wrong with an orchestrally accompanied screening of Charlie Chaplin's The Kid. SR

(Dublin, Glasgow) 
Even with a genre-shattering band such as Massive Attack, there still exists the notion of a definitive lineup. However, the group that made their first two classic albums - comprising 3D, Mushroom, Daddy G and Tricky - were destined for greatness but, given their volatile personalities, possibly never longevity. Since their mid-1990s heyday, though, the band have gained a monumental stature, embracing guest vocalists and political issues, becoming a kind of Newsnight version of Gorillaz, and lately working with film-maker Adam Curtis. The band have also attempted a rapprochement with Tricky, who has recorded for their new album - material from which may well be aired here - only to then apparently abruptly end the association. Evidently, like a dangerous country, Massive Attack is interesting to visit, though you wouldn't want to live there. JR

Higgins is cast as snooker's darkly irresistible demon who self-destructs even as Davis, in cahoots with ruthless promoter Barry Hearn, is taking the game into every living room. This narrative thrust is a slight over-simplification but does make for high drama. PH

Duffy and Lorent explore the dark dynamics of family life and the relationship between beauty and power, as the work shifts from the brilliant opulence of palace life to the forest where Snow White finds humour and compassion.

Oil prices slide back below $30, heading for 10% weekly loss - business live; 
Market braces itself for more supply from Iran when sanctions are lifted.

Russia has poured cold water on the idea of co-ordinated oil output cuts with Opec, the oil cartel, to prop up plunging oil prices. Brent crude is holding below the $30 a barrel mark on Friday, down 4% on the day. A global oil glut has pushed prices more than 70% lower over the past 18 months.
Russian energy minister Alexander Novak said it is unlikely that such cuts would be agreed, adding that they would "not be efficient" in any case.
The RIA news agency quoted Novak as saying in an interview with RBC TV: 
From our point of view, it is unlikely that all the countries within OPEC can agree on production cuts, let alone those countries which are not in the Opec coalition.
Such consultations have been underway for the past year and a half since oil prices started to fall in mid-2014. [But] we see that in 2015 countries like Saudi Arabia in Opec have increased total production by 1.5m barrels per day."
Last month's Opec meeting ended without an agreement on how to shore up oil prices and some members of the cartel urged Russia to reduce its own output.
In the past, Russia has argued that its harsh climate makes it hard to restart production once wells have been closed.

 Bank of England bans ex-Co-op bosses  
The Bank of England has banned the former boss of the Co-operative Bank, Barry Tootell, from holding a senior banking job. The lender nearly collapsed under the weight of its debts.
The Bank's Prudential Regulation Authority also banned Keith Alderson, a former managing director of the Co-op Bank's corporate and business banking division. Both men also received fines.
It is the first time the chief executive of a bank has been banned over their role during the financial crisis.
PRA chief executive Andrew Bailey said:
This action makes clear that there are serious consequences for senior individuals who fall short of the PRA's expectations. The new Senior Managers Regime, which will be introduced in March, will further ensure that senior managers are held duly responsible for their actions."

 Here in the UK, the energy regulator has accused the big six energy firms of overcharging customers. They haven't cut their retail prices despite plunging wholesale prices on international markets.  
The Guardian's energy editor Terry Macalister writes:
The big six energy companies including SSE, npower and E.ON have made no recent announcements about cutting retail prices although British Gas did reduce its tariff by 5% last August.
"I think they are overcharging in many cases," the head of Ofgem Dermot Nolan told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. There should be bigger cuts in retail energy bills, he added.

 Brent crude at a 12-year low  
Back to oil, which is still below $30 a barrel. It hit $29.73 at one stage, the lowest since February 2004, and is now trading at $29.89 a barrel. 
The International Atomic Energy Agency could issue its report on Iran's compliance with an agreement to rein in its nuclear programme during a meeting in Vienna on Friday, whereupon western sanctions could be lifted and open the door to more oil supply from Iran. The country's oil exports are already on track to hit a nine-month high in January, at 1.1m barrels a day.
Analysts at Commerzbank said:
With sanctions on Iran likely to be lifted, more oil is flooding the markets. Although the additional supply had been imminent for some time, current sentiment ought to send prices further south."

 Greece's European lenders likely to start reform review next week  
Greece's European lenders are expected to start a review of Athens' reform programme next week, although talks on debt relief may still be several months away.
Before those talks start, Greece needs to conclude a first review of reforms agreed last summer under its third bailout programme with its lenders, which include the EU executive and the International Monetary Fund.
European Commission vice president Valdis Dombrovskis said in an interview with Greek daily Kathimerini:
We are ready to the start the review as soon as possible, most likely next week. But we are not setting any time limit for when the review should be concluded."
Dombrovskis said that to secure a positive progress review, Greece needs to implement pension reform, set up a new privatisation fund and find ways of achieving primary budget surpluses for 2016 to 2018.
He said:
If Greece concludes the review, it will show it is serious with its promises, its programme is on track and this would be a very positive step so that stability is restored."
Greece and some eurozone officials have said the review could be finished next month, but Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the chairman of eurozone finance ministers, cautioned on Thursday that it could be months rather than weeks.
Greece's finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos believes an agreement could be reached within four weeks. He has been touring eurozone capitals to explain the reforms and drum up support for an early conclusion to the review.
Dombrovskis said the European Commission is assuming that the IMF will once again be part of the bailout. The Washington-based fund provided financing for Greece's first two bailouts in 2010 and 2012. But IMF chief Christine Lagarde has said that the fund will probably only decide in the spring whether to take part in the third bailout.
She told Germany's S¸ddeutsche Zeitung that the issues of debt sustainability and progress on pension reforms will be key.
It is clear that pension reform is the trigger that will prove that Greece's economic position is improving."
The IMF has not provided any aid to Athens since August 2014 under a previous programme that is due to expire next March.

Nick Bubb says about BonmarchÈ,  which already lowered its profit estimates in mid-December and stuck to that guidance today:
Back on Dec 16 th, poor old BonmarchÈ was one of the first fashion retailers to warn that trading conditions during November and early December had been very challenging and since then that story has been well played out. 
 Interestingly, however, Beth Butterwick, (the soon-to-be-departed CEO), says: " In the short period since Christmas, demand has trended towards more normal levels " (which bears out the message from the recent John Lewis sales figures."
The latest John Lewis figures out this morning were strong, showing sales rising 15.6% last week year-on-year (against a sluggish week a year ago), driven by electrical goods (up 18.8%) and fashion (15.4%). Online sales were also strong, rising nearly 26%.

 Corporate round-up  
After Thursday's flurry of retail news, Friday is much quieter. Here's a round-up of the main corporate news.
 The competition regulator has given the final clearance for BT's contentious £12.5bn takeover of EE, Britain's largest mobile phone network, reports Sean Farrell.  You can read more here.
The Competition and Markets Authority said it did not expect the takeover to lead to a substantial reduction in competition or detriment to consumers in any market in the UK, including mobile and broadband services.
It said there was little overlap between BT's mainly fixed phone, broadband and pay-TV business and EE's mobile phone operation. The merger was also unlikely to make things worse for other operators using BT's network.
 UK housebuilder Bovis Homes is leading gains on the FTSE 250 index, rising 3.4% to 953p, after posting record profits for 2015. The company delivered 3,934 homes last year, which represents an increase of over 8% from 2014. The average selling price rose 7% to £231,000. Like its peers, Bovis is confident about the housing market, which is underpinned by government-backed initiatives such as help to buy.
 H&M said it had a good December, with sales up 10% year-on-year. In November, mild weather in north America and Europe put customers off buying winter clothing at the Swedish retailer and sales rose only 4%.
 BonmarchÈ, the UK bargain fashion retailer who targets women over 50, fared less well. Like-for-like sales were down 1.3% in the quarter to 26 December.

Simon Smith, chief economist at broker FxPro, says 2016 so far has been a "terrible year for global stock markets".
According to unofficial theory a 20% decline in a stock index means that it has entered an official bear market and we saw this from the Shanghai Composite overnight following another 3.5% loss. The end of the week in Asia has seen emerging markets record their third weekly loss in a row and the same can be said for some European markets. 
This is now starting to be reflected in profit forecasts for S&P companies across the pond where we're seeing the most downgrades to earnings compared to upgrades since 2009. Crude prices are also lower overnight but for all the talk about whether oil will fall to $20 or whether it won't we have to remember that commodities entered their massive bear market by the 20% measure as far back as 2014."

 VW market share in Europe falls for first time since 2007  
European car sales figures are out. They show that Volkswagen's market share in Europe fell last year for the first time since 2007 as the emissions rigging scandal took its toll.
VW accounted for 24.8% of new cars sold in Europe compared with 25.5% in 2014, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association in Brussels.
The industry as a whole had a good year, with sales jumping 9.2% to a six-year high of 14.2m vehicles, compared with VW's 6.2% increase.
Europe's biggest carmaker has lost ground to rivals such as Fiat Chrysler, BMW and Daimler since the scandal broke in mid-September and put consumers off buying its cars. Bloomberg has all the details.

 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. 
Brent crude is continuing its slide, trading down 1.85% at $30.31 a barrel at the minute. New York Light crude is down even more, losing 3% to $30.27 a barrel. 
The market is bracing itself for more supply from Iran. Western sanctions on the country are expected to be lifted within days, after a historic nuclear deal with Tehran was reached last summer.
Brent is heading for a weekly loss of about 10%. Mining giant BHP Billiton has been forced to write down the value of its onshore American oil and gas assets by more than 30% in the wake of the slump in crude oil prices.
Fresh pressure on oil prices and poor Chinese lending data pushed Asian stocks to 3 1/2 year lows on Friday. 
New lending by Chinese banks was weaker than expected in December and well down on the previous month. Banks extended 597.8bn yuan ($90.76bn) of new loans in the final month of 2015, fuelling concerns that Beijing's efforts to boost borrowing via monetary easing are not transmitting to the real economy.
Li Huiyong, an economist at Shenyin & Wanguo Securities in Shanghai, said:
The fall in new yuan loans showed there was little demand for investment and reflected sluggish economic performance in the real economy."

This week's new films; 
The Revenant | Room | Creed | Dragon Blade | Ip Man 3 | Breakdown | Patience, Patience You'll Go To Paradise.

Steve Rose.

The Revenant (15) (Alejandro Gonz·lez IÒ·rritu, 2015, US) Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hardy, Domhnall Gleeson, Will Poulter, Forrest Goodluck. 156 mins
There have been epic wilderness westerns before, but none quite as epic or wild as this. At times it's so viscerally real and outrageously grand, you can't quite believe what you're seeing, let alone imagine how they did it - not least the already-infamous bear-attack scene. That show-stopping mauling sets DiCaprio's fur trapper on a purgatorial cross-country survival/revenge mission through a freezing cold gamut of frontier adversities, natural and human. The story, based on a true account, is pretty old-fashioned at heart, but the execution is state of the art.

Room (15) (Lenny Abrahamson, 2015, Ire/Can) Brie Larson, Jacob Tremblay, Joan Allen, William H Macy, Sean Bridgers. 118 mins
Adapting Emma Donoghue's bestseller about a boy raised with his mother in one-room captivity has its challenges - maintaining a child's-eye view is far easier on the page. But this one-of-a-kind story pays off thanks to terrific acting and a sensitivity that never spills into sentimentality. It's a story of two halves, divided by an escape plan. Both confinement and freedom have their challenges. 

Creed (12A) (Ryan Coogler, 2015, US) Michael B Jordan, Sylvester Stallone, Tessa Thompson. 133 mins
It's a little heavy on its feet at times, but this belated Rocky episode is an unexpected bonus, and surprisingly up-to-date - not least in its African-American hero. Apollo Creed's illegitimate son must fight his father's legacy as well as opponents in the ring. As his sage mentor, Stallone has his own battles to fight.

Dragon Blade (15) (Daniel Lee, 2015, Chi) Jackie Chan, John Cusack, Adrien Brody. 99 mins
East meets west in yet another fruitless attempt to create a pan-global blockbuster. This time, the encounter takes place somewhere along the Silk Road during Roman/Han dynasty times. The rest isn't history. Epic battle action is a given; hammy drama makes a nonsense of it.

Ip Man 3 (12A) (Wilson Yip, 2015, HK) Donnie Yen, Zhang Jin, Mike Tyson. 105 mins
Bruce Lee's real-life mentor has become an unlikely franchise folk hero, here facing off against domestic problems and Tyson's American crook in 1950s Hong Kong. As usual, Yen has the gravitas and fighting skills to make it work.

Breakdown (15) (Jonnie Malachi, 2016, UK) Craig Fairbrass, James Cosmo, Emmett J Scanlan. 110 mins
Plenty of slick, macho action thrills as a former hitman protects himself and his family from hostile heavies - primarily by shooting them all.

Patience, Patience You'll Go To Paradise! (NC) (Hadja Lahbib, 2015, Bel) 85 mins

It is the first time the chief executive of a bank has been banned over their role during the financial crisis.

Greece's European lenders are expected to start a review of Athens' reform programme next week, although talks on debt relief may still be several months away.
Before those talks start, Greece needs to conclude a first review of reforms agreed last summer under its third bailout programme with its lenders, which include the EU executive and the International Monetary Fund.
European Commission vice president Valdis Dombrovskis said in an interview with Greek daily Kathimerini:
We are ready to the start the review as soon as possible, most likely next week. But we are not setting any time limit for when the review should be concluded."
Dombrovskis said that to secure a positive progress review, Greece needs to implement pension reform, set up a new privatisation fund and find ways of achieving primary budget surpluses for 2016 to 2018.
He said:
If Greece concludes the review, it will show it is serious with its promises, its programme is on track and this would be a very positive step so that stability is restored."
Greece and some eurozone officials have said the review could be finished next month, but Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the chairman of eurozone finance ministers, cautioned on Thursday that it could be months rather than weeks.
Greece's finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos believes an agreement could be reached within four weeks. He has been touring eurozone capitals to explain the reforms and drum up support for an early conclusion to the review.
Dombrovskis said the European Commission is assuming that the IMF will once again be part of the bailout. The Washington-based fund provided financing for Greece's first two bailouts in 2010 and 2012. But IMF chief Christine Lagarde has said that the fund will probably only decide in the spring whether to take part in the third bailout.
She told Germany's S¸ddeutsche Zeitung that the issues of debt sustainability and progress on pension reforms will be key.
It is clear that pension reform is the trigger that will prove that Greece's economic position is improving."

Nick Bubb says about BonmarchÈ,  which already lowered its profit estimates in mid-December and stuck to that guidance today:
Back on Dec 16 th, poor old BonmarchÈ was one of the first fashion retailers to warn that trading conditions during November and early December had been very challenging and since then that story has been well played out. 
 Interestingly, however, Beth Butterwick, (the soon-to-be-departed CEO), says: " In the short period since Christmas, demand has trended towards more normal levels " (which bears out the message from the recent John Lewis sales figures."
The latest John Lewis figures out this morning were strong, showing sales rising 15.6% last week year-on-year (against a sluggish week a year ago), driven by electrical goods (up 18.8%) and fashion (15.4%). Online sales were also strong, rising nearly 26%.

 Corporate round-up  
After Thursday's flurry of retail news, Friday is much quieter. Here's a round-up of the main corporate news.
 The competition regulator has given the final clearance for BT's contentious £12.5bn takeover of EE, Britain's largest mobile phone network, reports Sean Farrell.  You can read more here.
The Competition and Markets Authority said it did not expect the takeover to lead to a substantial reduction in competition or detriment to consumers in any market in the UK, including mobile and broadband services.
It said there was little overlap between BT's mainly fixed phone, broadband and pay-TV business and EE's mobile phone operation. The merger was also unlikely to make things worse for other operators using BT's network.
 UK housebuilder Bovis Homes is leading gains on the FTSE 250 index, rising 3.4% to 953p, after posting record profits for 2015. The company delivered 3,934 homes last year, which represents an increase of over 8% from 2014. The average selling price rose 7% to £231,000. Like its peers, Bovis is confident about the housing market, which is underpinned by government-backed initiatives such as help to buy.
 H&M said it had a good December, with sales up 10% year-on-year. In November, mild weather in north America and Europe put customers off buying winter clothing at the Swedish retailer and sales rose only 4%.
 BonmarchÈ, the UK bargain fashion retailer who targets women over 50, fared less well. Like-for-like sales were down 1.3% in the quarter to 26 December.

Simon Smith, chief economist at broker FxPro, says 2016 so far has been a "terrible year for global stock markets".
According to unofficial theory a 20% decline in a stock index means that it has entered an official bear market and we saw this from the Shanghai Composite overnight following another 3.5% loss. The end of the week in Asia has seen emerging markets record their third weekly loss in a row and the same can be said for some European markets. 
This is now starting to be reflected in profit forecasts for S&P companies across the pond where we're seeing the most downgrades to earnings compared to upgrades since 2009. Crude prices are also lower overnight but for all the talk about whether oil will fall to $20 or whether it won't we have to remember that commodities entered their massive bear market by the 20% measure as far back as 2014."

 Shanghai shares enter bear market  
This means that the Shanghai Composite index, which recorded its lowest close since December 2014, is now in a bear market. It has lost more than 20% from its recent high on 22 December. A bear market is defined as a drop of 20% or more from a recent high.
The tech-focused Shenzhen Composite, which finished 3.4% lower at 1,796.1, already entered a bear market a week ago, and is now down 24.5% from its recent 22 December high.

 VW market share in Europe falls for first time since 2007  
European car sales figures are out. They show that Volkswagen's market share in Europe fell last year for the first time since 2007 as the emissions rigging scandal took its toll.
VW accounted for 24.8% of new cars sold in Europe compared with 25.5% in 2014, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association in Brussels.
The industry as a whole had a good year, with sales jumping 9.2% to a six-year high of 14.2m vehicles, compared with VW's 6.2% increase.
Europe's biggest carmaker has lost ground to rivals such as Fiat Chrysler, BMW and Daimler since the scandal broke in mid-September and put consumers off buying its cars. Bloomberg has all the details.

 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. 
Brent crude is continuing its slide, trading down 1.85% at $30.31 a barrel at the minute. New York Light crude is down even more, losing 3% to $30.27 a barrel. 
The market is bracing itself for more supply from Iran. Western sanctions on the country are expected to be lifted within days, after a historic nuclear deal with Tehran was reached last summer.
Brent is heading for a weekly loss of about 10%. Mining giant BHP Billiton has been forced to write down the value of its onshore American oil and gas assets by more than 30% in the wake of the slump in crude oil prices.
Fresh pressure on oil prices and poor Chinese lending data pushed Asian stocks to 3 1/2 year lows on Friday. 
New lending by Chinese banks was weaker than expected in December and well down on the previous month. Banks extended 597.8bn yuan ($90.76bn) of new loans in the final month of 2015, fuelling concerns that Beijing's efforts to boost borrowing via monetary easing are not transmitting to the real economy.
Li Huiyong, an economist at Shenyin & Wanguo Securities in Shanghai, said:
The fall in new yuan loans showed there was little demand for investment and reflected sluggish economic performance in the real economy."
