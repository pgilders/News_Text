TroJan horse school head banned from teaching.

Greg Hurst.

A head teacher who was accused of misconduct in the Trojan horse scandal after he forbade Christmas celebrations at a school has been banned from the profession. 
Jahangir Akbar, who was acting headmaster of Oldknow Academy primary school in Birmingham, will have to wait for five years before he can apply to teach again. A disciplinary panel upheld a charge against him last month that he agreed with others to subject pupils at the school to an undue amount of religious influence.
Mr Akbar is one of 14 teachers at schools linked to the Trojan horse scandal that face misconduct hearings brought by the National College for Teaching and Leadership, part of the Department for Education.
Oldknow Academy was one of five schools in east Birmingham that failed an Ofsted inspection when the body was investigating claims of a plot by conservative Muslims to take control of schools. It has since been taken over by a new sponsor and renamed.
The panel, which reconvened yesterday to announce the sanction that it agreed in Mr Akbar's case, described his misconduct as "of a serious nature".
The hearing accepted evidence that he banned the celebrations of Christmas and Diwali and instead introduced a two-day event for the Muslim festival of Eid. He also allowed pupils to go on a ten-day pilgrimage to Mecca.
Allegations that Mr Akbar had prohibited sex education were dismissed. Two other teachers, Akeel Ahmed and Inamulhaq Anwar, who both taught at Park View Academy, have also been found guilty of having agreed to include an undue amount of religious influence on pupils' education. The other cases are still being heard.

US sues Volkswagen over cheating on emission tests.

Alexandra Frean.

The US government has launched a lawsuit against Volkswagen for cheating on vehicle emissions tests which could land the car-maker with penalties of $22 billion, higher than initial estimates of $18 billion. 
The civil suit, filed yesterday in Detroit by the Department of Justice on behalf of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), alleges that VW installed illegal defeat devices in nearly 600,000 diesel cars sold in the US to enable them to cheat the tests.
It is the first case brought against the company by the Department of Justice.
The company could still face separate criminal charges. A number of private class-action lawsuits by VW owners are also pending and analysts believe that the total cost to the company in fines, compensation and repairs could come to (EURO)30 billion.
"We're alleging that they knew what they were doing, they intentionally violated the law and that the consequences were significant to health," a senior justice department official said.
Volkswagen admitted last September that it had included software in diesel cars sold since 2009 that enabled them to cheat on emissions tests. The scandal led to the departure of Martin Winterkorn as chief executive and wiped millions off the company's value as the share price plummeted.
Cynthia Giles, of the EPA, said that the lawsuit followed unsatisfactory discussions with Volkswagen over a recall ordered to fix the affected cars. "These discussions will continue in parallel with the federal court action," she said.
She said that the action was an important step to protect public health by seeking to hold Volkswagen accountable for unlawful air pollution.
Volkswagen could face civil penalties of $37,500 for each vehicle. The EPA initially complained about 482,000.
Yesterday's court filing covers 499,000 two-litre diesel cars sold since 2009 which were potentially emitting harmful nitrogen oxide fumes at up to 40 times the permitted levels and a further 85,000 three-litre vehicles that were at nine times the acceptable levels.
Volkswagen said in a statement that it would continue to work with all government agencies investigating these matters and would work with the EPA on developing remedies to bring the affected vehicles into compliance with regulations "as soon as possible".

A sugar tax is vital if we're to keep the NHS alive.

Liam Donaldson.

The biggest public health crisis of the past 30 years was bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Public concern about "mad cow disease" spread more rapidly than the disease itself, fuelled by the knowledge that it was incurable, by the idea that seemingly any meateater could catch it, and by the distressing image of an afflicted cow staggering to keep its footing. 
The BSE crisis quickly became a scandal as the public lost confidence in the health advice coming from government. What did the public think was the role of government? It was pretty obvious that people expected it to protect them against risks to their health. They became particularly angry if there was any hint of a cover-up or if the government seemed to be placing the interests of industry ahead of the public's health.
Governments now seem to accept their responsibility to protect the public against threats such as pandemic flu and Sars. When I was chief medical officer they certainly gave me full support in the planning and action necessary to mitigate the risks.
Yet helping the public to avoid the risks of modern living is contentious and is not usually seen through the lens of "protection". During my time in office, my recommendations on measures such as a minimum unit price for alcohol were rejected because of two primal political forces: the politician's mortal dread of being labelled a member of the nanny state, and a fear of removing people's perceived pleasures.
For the same reasons, the government recently rejected a sensible measure to fight obesity, heart disease and cancer: a sugar tax. Instead of showing courage, policymaking too often starts with the question: "Who will we upset?" Fear of nanny runs deep.
Such polling of attitudes as has been undertaken suggests that the public quite approves of strong action to protect health. Public awareness of the societal burden of obesity-related illness is growing: It is becoming less acceptable to offer a can of sugary fizzy drink to a child.
The National Health Service, like others around the world, faces the pressing question of how to provide safe, high-quality care without running out of money. Delaying the onset of chronic disease is vital. Without action, the NHS may become unsustainable.

Curse of Bride of Wildenstein puts leading art dealer in court.

Adam Sage.

France's most dominant art dealer went on trial in Paris yesterday accused of concealing a fabulous collection of paintings to avoid paying hundreds of millions of euros in inheritance tax.
Guy Wildenstein, 70, a towering figure in the fine art business, faces up to 10 years in prison if found guilty of tax evasion and money laundering.
The French-American dealer, who said that he earned (EURO)1 million a year, and his relatives are also being asked to settle an unpaid tax bill of (EURO)550 million, a record in France. 
He is accused of concealing much of his inherited fortune in tax havens after he and his late brother Alec fraudulently undervalued the estate of their father Daniel, a French citizen and a renowned art dealer, collector and historian, who died in Paris in 2001.
French prosecutors say that as their father lay dying they began moving his assets, transferring their ownership and moving artworks valued at (EURO)230 million from New York to Switzerland. The vast wealth came to the authorities' notice when two widows in the family claimed that they had been cheated out of their inheritances.
To make matters worse for the brothers, they were then subject to unwanted publicity when Jocelyn Wildenstein, Alec's first wife - known as the Bride of Wildenstein for her infatuation with plastic surgery - lifted the lid on their fortune. Ms Wildenstein revealed the extent and whereabouts of her ex-husband's estate thereby helping the tax authorities to track family assets. She received $2.5 billion as a divorce settlement and was rumoured to have spent $4m on plastic surgery that gave her a cat like appearance. Mr Wildenstein appeared in a criminal court in Paris alongside Alec Jr, his nephew, Liouba Stoupakova, his late brother's widow, and five of their advisers. All deny wrongdoing.
Mr Wildenstein's lawyers asked for the case to be thrown out on the grounds that it was unconstitutional to combine a criminal trial with civil proceedings over unpaid tax.
The trial is being observed anxiously by dealers in Europe and the US concerned that the scandal surrounding the Wildensteins could shed unwanted light on their secretive world. Mr Wildenstein and his late brother claimed to have inherited (EURO)40.9 million when their father died. They settled the inheritance tax bill of (EURO)17.7 million by giving the treasury basreliefs sculpted for Marie-Antoinette. Prosecutors said that the true value of their inheritance was (EURO)616 million, with ownership of most of the assets, including racehorses, galleries and a private jet hidden in offshore trusts. One, the Sylvia Trust, in the Bahamas, held 19 works by Bonnard, the post-impressionist, valued at (EURO)65 million.
Another, the Delta Trust, in the Cayman Islands, held paintings by Picasso, Courbet, the 19th century French realist and Fragonard, the 18th century rococo master. A third trust, in the Virgin Islands, holds a 30,000 hectare ranch in Kenya where Out of Africa was filmed.
Prosecutors allege that the paintings, whilst ostensibly held by off-shore trusts, were in fact in the family's vaults, notably in Switzerland.
In a rare interview with Paris Match, the French magazine, Mr Wildenstein said that he knew that his father had used trusts but claimed that he did not know the details, being himself "neither a tax nor a financial specialist". He also claimed that French law did not then require anyone to declare estate held in these trusts to tax authorities.
The family began dealing in art more than 100 years ago, and came to wield huge influence in Paris and New York in the 20th century. Mr Wildenstein's father was a renowned Monet expert whose collection included 25 works by Renoir, ten by Van Gogh, ten by CÈzanne and eight by Rembrandt. In many of the works owned by the dynasty, such as The Letter by Fragonard, love is idealised. In practice, it has often been wrapped up in mundane considerations of cash.
Sylvia Wildenstein, Daniel's widow, claimed that she had been cheated out of her inheritance by his sons. Her legal action ended when she died in 2010, but by then she had also told tax officials how to find assets allegedly hidden by the family. Her help led to the disclosure that the "private collector" who lent The Lute Player by Caravaggio, valued at £69 million, to New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, was the Wildenstein family. She also prompted investigators to raid the Wildenstein Institute in Paris, where they found Cottage in Normandy, an oil painting by Berthe Morisot, the French impressionist, which is valued at (EURO)800,000. Mr Wildenstein told them that he had no idea that it was there.
The trial continues.
Jocelyn Wildenstein, who divorced Alec, drew attention to the size and location of the family's assets when the tax authorities began to examine them. Guy Wildenstein faces ten years in jail if convicted. The Love Letter by Jean HonorÈ Fragonard, owned by the Wildensteins, shows their love for fine things

King abandoned me, says accused princess.

Graham Keeley.

Princess Cristina of Spain, who is to appear in court on Monday for the start of her trial for alleged tax evasion, has complained that her brother King Felipe and the rest of the royal family have abandoned her. 
The princess is accused of being an accessory to her husband's alleged tax evasion.
IÒaki Urdangarin, 47, a former Olympic handball star, is accused, along with a former business partner, of embezzling (EURO)6 million of public funds from contracts awarded to the Noos institute, a charitable foundation he chaired which organised sports events.
If convicted, he faces up to 19 years in jail; the princess faces a maximum of four years imprisonment. Both deny any wrongdoing.
They are among 18 people due to stand trial in Majorca on Monday.
A friend of Cristina, 50, told El EspaÒol, a Spanish online newspaper: "It is very tough to be abandoned by your family. She has been very struck by the coldness of the family, the ignorance and the contempt in which she has been held."
The couple and their four children were barred from the royal family's Christmas celebrations in Madrid. The couple were banned from royal duties after the judicial investigation into the allegations began in 2011. Last June, they were stripped of their titles as the Duke and Duchess of Palma by Felipe, who has tried to clean up the image of the royal family after the abdication of his father, Juan Carlos, in 2014.
Cristina, who works for the charitable foundation of La Caixa savings bank and lives in Geneva, is reluctant ever to return home. "They are judged and condemned," said a close source. "She will never return to Spain [to live]."
Mr Urdangarin was once the golden boy of the royal family. As a member of the Spanish handball team, he took part in the 1992, 1996 and 2000 Olympics and was team captain in 2000. He met Cristina at the 1996 games in Atlanta and they married in 1997.
He has been publicly humiliated since the scandal erupted in 2011. The couple's (EURO)6 million mansion in Barcelona was impounded by the courts as a guarantee and later sold.
Despite this, the princess has stood by him. "She is very close to her husband," a source said. "She will endure whatever happens."
Cristina remains sixth in line to the throne, a right only she can give up.

What happened to your self-respect, sisters?; 
The young woman in the Danczuk scandal is typical of those who are only too eager to bend to male whims and tastes.

Libby Purves.

Forget, for a moment, the political fate of the MP for Rochdale. After the revelation of his sexual messages to a teenage girl, Simon Danczuk kindly saved us time by saying it himself: "No fool like an old fool." So let his constituents decide, decently remembering his fine crusade against the abuse of their town's girls. Some middle-aged men will always pant after young girls, it's not news. What depresses me more about the correspondence is the fact that it was just that: a correspondence.
Ms Sophena Houlihan, in her own words, "played along" for quite a while because she was "keen for a career in politics". If the current teenage idea of a political career involves sending men thirty years older shots of yourself with half your breasts out, we may need an overhaul of the citizenship curriculum. But Ms Houlihan, face it, was following an older professional path. She knew what she was selling, for a job and a mentor, and it wasn't her passion for socialist theory. 
Read the emails. Much hilarity at Mr Danczuk followed his "I'm horny", and clumsy dad-dancing claims to love "The Article Monkeys" and go to Glastonbury. But on the other side we have the girl, complimented on her tight bodysuit, texting that it "would look better on your bedroom floor". When he says "cheeky!" and threatens to "discipline" her she replies "please do", hence the spanking theme. She only stops cyberflirting and estimates its tabloid value when - IRL, In Real Life, as they say - the MP is dating someone else.
It's the lack of female self-respect that gets me down, not only in this case. Self-respect, an old-fashioned term, is not the same as the more modish "self-esteem", which often transmutes into vanity, a sense of universal entitlement and an inability to take criticism. Selfrespect is deeper, a determination not to let yourself down. It does not embrace the needy narcissism of the selfie (to which the last Mrs Danczuk is famously prone). It does not flirt for advancement; fake or sell serious private things like sexual attraction. Self-respect is not arrogant or calculating, simply a recognition that, however lowly, you are captain of your soul and mistress of your body. That dignity has sustained slaves and captives and martyrs and campaigners, from Marie Curie to Malala to Margaret Thatcher.
But the sexualised culture surrounding young women now torpedoes respect. Whether they are daft teenagers or spike-heeled, hyper-groomed, ambitious professionals pouting for LinkedIn, it tells them that a quick way to success is to look fruity and act flirty.
Sophena Houlihan says she corresponded for weeks about a job before Mr Danczuk asked her age, but she then responded keenly to his lumpen desire. Self-respect would have cut him off sharply, reflecting "dirty old man!" and looking elsewhere for mentors. But that kind of strength is not sufficiently taught today. And when women do use sex, rather than talent, to get ahead it sets back the cause of real equality and embeds deeper in men the conviction that we are shallow, ruled by vanity and probably up for sale.
Look elsewhere and this weary old feminist's heart sinks further. The MP's ex-wives are engaged in a ridiculous catfight, the most recent one - Karen-the-selfie - accusing her predecessor Sonia of being an embittered woman with a sleazy past; Sonia brandishes claims that her husband was a bully exerting "a form of domestic violence", but prefers to take that very serious allegation to a newspaper rather than the police. Again, not selfrespect but a modishly keen embrace of victimhood.
I'll get trolled from both sides for this, and you might say that I too am in a catfight, providing that womenwrestling-in-mud spectacle that traditionally delights male onlookers. I hope not. I wish all women and girls well, delight in those with style or talent or both, mourn for those who suffer. But we need to recognise and deplore that canker of low selfworth, that eagerness to bend to male whims and tastes.
It rarely makes us happy. It runs all the way from young teenage girls, who in repeated surveys overwhelmingly regret early loss of virginity but say they did it because they wanted to be liked and the boys insisted. Then in tales of mid-life we read the humiliating cases of women conned by online dating frauds. Four men were recently jailed for a www.Match.com scam that duped women out of money. One intelligent, professional divorcÈe lost £174,000 to the blandishments of a fake lover she never even met: tellingly, she says now that what she lost was "selfrespect ... I was caught up in this and it was my undoing".
That theme again: the female need to measure her worth by a man's desire. Ancient, historic injustices and contempts - bride-selling, prostitution, male ownership - still haunt the inner lives of women and girls, just as they haunt oppressed populations. They need to be acknowledged in order to be challenged.
So taking that parallel, cite the refreshing Mary Beard commenting on the Rhodes statue row. She asks offended students "to look up at Rhodes with a cheery and selfconfident sense of unbatterability - much as I find myself looking up at the statues of those hundreds of men in history who would have vehemently objected to women having the vote, let alone the kind of job I have". Stare back bravely, girls, and keep your clothes on.
It's recognition that you are captain of your soul, mistress of your body
Historic INJUSTICES still haunt the inner lives of women and girls

MPs could be told to move into halls

Sam Coates Deputy Political Editor MPs could be forced to surrender their second homes and move into halls of residence to save money under plans being considered by the expenses watchdog. 
Ipsa, the parliamentary standards watchdog, is seeking to cut the accommodation bill for MPs, given that they only need their London homes for 230 days a year. It is considering a number of options for reform, including housing MPs in serviced accommodation. Last year MPs with constituencies outside London spent £6.6 million on hotels, rentals and "associated costs". Under current Ipsa guidelines MPs can claim up to £20,600 a year for rent and up to £150 a night for hotels. They have not been able to claim for mortgage interest payments since the expenses scandal.
In the minutes of an Ipsa board meeting, the watchdog said that the funding of MPs' accommodation costs was "still viewed equivocally". The minutes went on: "This is particularly the case given that many MPs rent a property in London, retaining it throughout the year when parliament only sits for circa 230 days of the year."
MPs have reacted angrily to the plans. One told The Mail on Sunday: "What they really mean is forcing us to slum it in university-style blocks.
"What are they going to do? Segregate us into different blocks according to party colours: Cameron's lot in Tory Towers and Corbyn's camp at Labour Lubyanka?" The proposals could also include folding the accommodation allowance into MPs' £74,000 salaries.
Charles Walker, a Conservative MP, said: "The suggestion that MPs are somehow deriving a personal benefit from being separated from their families for 200 days a year is ridiculous." An investigation last year found that 46 MP had claimed expenses for rent or hotels in London, despite owning a taxpayer-funded property in the capital. A spokesman for Ipsa said: "Ipsa wants MPs to be able to stay in London and their constituencies, to do their jobs in two locations and to deliver good value for money for taxpayers. This year we will look at a range of options for how we can do both in the future."
A Tory MP has revealed that he is living on a boat in southeast London to avoid "obscene house price costs". Johnny Mercer, a former soldier who served in Afghanistan and was elected in May as the MP for Plymouth Moor View, brought his boat up from the south coast and moors it near Canada Water.
The boat does not have central heating or a shower, but Mr Mercer told The Daily Telegraph that he preferred it to a hotel room. It also allows him to claim only £2,400 a year for accommodation. He said the MPs' allowance "was an obscene amount of money for two or three nights a week and I wasn't prepared to spend that".

They made the headlines, but what happened next?

One of them tried to change his country's economy, another tried to change her race. One moved to Japan, another moved - amid extreme secrecy - to a light industrial estate in southeast London. Some sought adversity, some had it thrust upon them - one in the form of a hungry Jeremy Clarkson.
What links them all is that whether through tragedy or tragicomedy, their fame briefly flared in 2015. What came next though? How do you recover from an atrocity or from being at the centre of a global scandal? When the cameras left, the Twitterstorms calmed and the front page stories were lining the rabbit cage, what did their lives become? Here we follow up some of the newsworthy names of the past year.
Aylan Kurdi's father It was the photograph that brought home the enormity of the refugee crisis (Hannah Lucinda Smith writes). Aylan Kurdiwas not the first refugee child to drown in the seas between Turkey and Greece, but he changed the debate. Before that photo of Aylan, the refugees fighting their way to Europe were numbers. After it, if only briefly, they had names. 
The photo prompted a huge wave of social action. Volunteers are still flocking to the Greek islands to help refugees arriving in their thousands.
At the mortuary, 12 hours after his wife and two sons perished, Aylan's father, Abdullah, looked a broken man, dressed in borrowed clothes, eyes raw, he said that all he wanted was to go back home to Syria with the bodies of his family and spend the rest of his life close to them. He is now torn between two lives: the one he was so desperate to escape that he took his family on that treacherous journey, and a new one that, cruelly, has now been opened up to him after the tragedy he suffered. Canada, which had refused the family asylum, has offered him a place. Iraqi Kurdistan, spotting a PR opportunity, has hosted him in hotels. Now living in Istanbul, he says that any place would still feel like purgatory.
Sir Tim Hunt "Let me tell you about my trouble with girls," said the Nobel medicine laureate Sir Tim Hunt last June in a speech about women in science that would change his life and trigger the year's most extraordinary academic row (Carol Midgley writes). "Three things happen when they are in the lab. You fall in love with them, they fall in love with you and when you criticise them, they cry."
The British biochemist said later that his remarks were intended as "light-hearted ironic comment" and he did follow on with the phrase "Now seriously". But he hadn't reckoned with the attack-dog ferocity of social media. His words were tweeted by some audience members then shared around the globe.
Suddenly he was the "sexism row scientist", bombarded with hate mail and forced to resign from UCL and the European Research Council. An eminent scientist had been turned into an online punchbag and, to use his words, a "straw man" over a couple of ill-judged sentences.
Many leading figures in science publicly supported him including Richard Dawkins, Brian Cox, Dame Athene Donald, professor of experimental physics at Cambridge University, and young women who had worked with him in laboratories. By October Sir Colin Blakemore had resigned as honorary president of the Association of British Science Writers because it supported Connie St Louis, one of the journalists present at Sir Tim's speech who was accused of presenting an exaggerated account.
Six months on it turns out that Sir Tim is leaving for a new life in Japan. His wife, Mary Collins, a senior scientist at University College London, has been appointed director of research for the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology and he will move with her for five years. "I will be very happy," Sir Tim says. "I will do the shopping and the cooking." They insist that they aren't being "chased out of the country" and this was always part of her life plan. But the fact that Britain is now losing one of its leading female scientists is a rather ironic ending to the story.
Yanis Varoufakis The leather-jacket-wearing, motorbike-riding political economist Yanis Varoufakis, 54, made quite an entrance into European politics last January when he was appointed as Greece's finance minister after Syriza swept to power (Caroline Argyropulo-Palmer writes).
Hailing from a privileged background, he was criticised as a champagne socialist after posing for a magazine spread on the terrace of his house overlooking the Acropolis with his glamorous wife, Danae Stratou, said to be the inspiration for Pulp's Common People.
He won fans in Greece by standing up to creditors and refusing to play by establishment rules - not tucking in his shirt or wearing a tie, even while visiting Downing Street. His eurozone colleagues were less impressed. He successfully led the campaign to reject the terms of the bailout offer in a referendum in June but then dramatically resigned.
However, he hasn't retired from politics. He has parlayed his celebrity into speaking and writing engagements and has appeared on a platform with John McDonnell and has met Jeremy Corbyn a few times, remarking to The Guardian that their "chemistry is excellent". He is part of a group that aims to set up "a pan-European democratic movement" to tackle the refugee crisis, financial crisis and the rise of the far-right.
The Edstone Five days before polling day, Ed Miliband arrived in a Hastings car park for what became the iconic moment of his party's election campaign. Flanked by activists and supporters, the Labour leader unveiled an 8ft 6in limestone tablet which "set in stone" six pledges to voters (Callum Jones writes).
As his officials explained that the plinth - quickly nicknamed "the Edstone" - would be erected in the Downing Street Rose Garden after a Labour victory, Mr Miliband declared: "I want the British people to remember these pledges, to remind us of these pledges, to insist on these pledges."
Cynics and critics quickly aligned to ridicule the gimmick. Lucy Powell, vice-chairwoman of Labour's election campaign, delivered a somewhat off-message defence. "I don't think anyone is suggesting that the fact he has carved them into stone means that he is absolutely not going to break them or anything like that," she said.
Once campaigning ceased, it did not take long for questions to arise regarding the whereabouts of the Edstone. The monolith was not to be placed at the heart of power, but where would it be installed instead? After a flurry of speculation, it was found in a warehouse on a southeast London industrial estate.
Torsten Bell, the former Labour policy adviser understood to have been behind the Edstone, recently put a positive spin on it. "We did a big service to British journalism by providing that level of fun and amusement for a considerable period," he told the BBC.
Luz the cartoonist RÈnald Luzier, the cartoonist known as Luz, arrived late at work at Charlie Hebdo on January 7 last year and thereby escaped the massacre (Adam Sage writes). Twelve people, including the editor of the satirical weekly, died in the attack, but as Luz arrived at the office the two French terrorists were driving off. His caricature of a weeping Muhammad saying "All is forgiven" was on the next front cover.
Four months later, Luz quit Charlie Hebdo, unable to cope with the sense of demoralisation gripping him after the trauma. He said that work had become a torture, and that he no longer wanted to produce cartoons week in, week out.
Luz did not put down his pen, however. On December 3, he did the cover drawing for Cahiers du CinÈma, the French film industry magazine. It was about the November attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead and showed a woman screaming in agony.
He also produced five more drawings for Le Monde illustrating victims of the November attacks. They were based on jottings that he had made at concerts by the Eagles of Death Metal, the US group that was on stage when the terrorists began shooting people at the Bataclan concert hall.
Next year, Luz is planning to bring out a cartoon adaptation of O Humans, My Brothers, the work in which Albert Cohen, the Swiss writer, recounted how he had to confront antisemitism as a child. Luz then plans to start on his "grand project" - a cartoon version of Stephen King's horror novel, The Shining.
The white black activist The revelation in June that the parents of the Washington civil rights activist Rachel Dolezal were white came as a shock to those who knew her: Ms Dolezal had been pretending to be black for a decade and had even described growing up in fear of white supremacists (Rhys Blakely writes).
Her childhood pictures show a pale girl with green eyes and blond hair.
Yet even after Ms Dolezal's parents stepped forward to say that she was of entirely "Caucasian and European descent" she insisted that she still regarded herself as being black. Her "self-identification with the black experience" began in infancy, she said. "I was drawing self-portraits with the brown crayon instead of the peach crayon."
Social media fizzed into overdrive. Ms Dolezal was forced to step down from her role in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. She also lost her position as an adjunct professor at Eastern Washington University, and her life story was rejected by publishers.
A mother of two, she told the Vice website last month that she was pregnant again and was out of work, and suggested that life had been difficult since she dropped out of the headlines.
"I've struggled with depression to the point where I wonder if it's even in my kids' best interest for me to stay around," she said.
"I feel like I'm a liability to my own children. I'm the only person equally hated by the KKK and black feminists."
The king of infidelity It was a bad year for Noel Biderman, the self-styled "king of infidelity" (Rhys Blakely writes). In July the website he founded, Ashley Madison, which claims to help people to have affairs, was hacked, exposing the personal details of 32 million would-be cheaters. Several suicides were linked to the breach. Mr Biderman, 44, was dubbed the internet's most hated man and was forced to resign from his role as chief executive of Avid Media, the parent company. He had previously shrugged off criticism of the site. "We're just a www.platform.No website or 30-second ad is going to convince anyone to cheat," he said. "People cheat because their lives aren't working for them."
Since the hack, Mr Biderman seems to have lost some of his chutzpah. He has declined interview requests and has kept a low profile. What appears to be his personal website describes how he "collects ancient coins and first edition novels". There is no mention of Ashley Madison. It is understood that he is still happily married to his wife of 12 years.
Clarkson's nemesis Oisin Tymon, 37, was the Top Gear producer on the end of an "unprovoked physical and verbal attack" from Jeremy Clarkson at a Yorkshire hotel which ended up with the presenter losing his contract despite a huge petition from fans for him to be reinstated (Kaya Burgess writes). The presenter was suspended after the "fracas", reportedly sparked by the lack of hot food at the end of a day's filming.
As Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond move to Amazon in a reported £160 million deal, the Irish producer is suing the lead presenter and the BBC for more than £100,000 for alleged racial discrimination and personal injury.
Aidan Turner's torso Sometimes all success takes is a judicious strip. A year ago Aidan Turner was a jobbing actor best known for playing a dwarf in The Hobbit. (James Jackson writes). Then came Poldark and that shirtless moment. The effects of his unselfish objectification of his body were instant: mass-swooning in armchairs, the "new Mr Darcy" tag, a Twitter account for his hair, and a thousand fan-selfies in the street.
You feel that the 32-year-old Dubliner is being disingenuous when he said in a recent interview that nothing had changed in his life since then. There has been the customary scrutiny of his love life - he recently became single again, although he was bombarded with proposals, both marriage and indecent ones, during a Twitter Q&A in March.
There have been job offers galore, although it seems he's being selective. We've just seen him in the BBC's And Then There Were None, where he went for a more 007 look as a genocidal mercenary in black tie - and William Hill cut his odds for becoming the next Bond from 20-1 to 12-1. In January he'll be seen in Jim Sheridan's film The Secret Scripture, opposite Rooney Mara, then there's a small New York indie movie called Look Away in a supporting role behind Matthew Broderick and Chloe Sevigny.
The the attention remains, however, on the new run of Poldark in 2016 (and possibly four more series beyond that). Fans have been lining the set to catch a glimpse of Turner.
Turner has also seen, post-Poldark, the name Aidan leap up the list of leading British baby names. Colin Firth never managed that.

On the morning of August 3, Tom Hayes dropped off his son at nursery. Hours later, he was sentenced to 14 years for fraud for the Libor fixing scandal. His life as a highly paid trader was over.; 
From his cell, the former UBS banker wrote to the Times City editor Harry Wilson, revealing what happened next. This is his story.

Harry Wilson.

Tom Hayes was found guilty of manipulating the Libor rate. This is the London interbank overnight lending rate, the benchmark used by financial institutions to determine interest rates. Below are the letters he sent from prison to Harry Wilson. In December, Hayes' sentence was reduced to 11 years
On the morning of August 3, Tom Hayes dropped off his four-yearold son, Josh, at a nursery; within hours he was told that his life as a highly paid trader was gone for good and he was squatting on a court toilet in view of a guard. He had become a convicted fraudster destined to spend at least the next 7 years in prison after being given a 14-year sentence.
"It was over," Hayes recalls in the first of his series of letters. "The guard led me into a room daubed in graffiti, with the faint smell of cigarettes and urine. The guard allowed me to use the toilet, but it had no door - the days of privacy and dignity were over. A plastic toilet with no seat. I couldn't really comprehend it.
"I was led to a small holding cell and the door behind me locked. I could hear banging and shouting from other cells. I curled up on the only thing in the cell, a wooden bench." 
After a 15-minute meeting with his lawyers, Hayes was taken to the prison van that would take him to Wandsworth Prison, where he would spend his first night behind bars.
"I was led away by a sympathetic female guard who reassured me. She handcuffed my wrist to hers, and we waited in line for those going to HMP Wandsworth to be searched. A large guy in front of me became aggressive about being searched. Later, I would meet him after he was convicted for a murder I suspect he didn't commit, but at the time it did nothing to soothe my nerves.
"I sat in the tiny room and figured if I sat with my back against the side of the van, no photographer would be able to get a photo of me. I pushed my back against the wall - they had enough photos; they didn't need one of me at my lowest ebb. As the van stopped at the junction to turn onto Tooley Street, the cameras flashed through the darkened windows. I scrunched back to keep out of shot.
"The drive through the busy commuter traffic was strange. I looked out of the window at everyone going home, passing familiar places. The guards played Capital Radio; I couldn't quite comprehend these were sights I wouldn't see for years. Life outside the van seemed so normal.
"We pulled through the gate house at Wandsworth. Vans were stacked up waiting to unload and we sat for about 30 minutes waiting for our turn. Slowly my shock was abating.
"We were ordered off the van. Most on it were on remand and returning for the day. I, on the other hand, was going through induction. A strip-search. My modesty seemed strangely immune. Again it seemed like a dream, followed by an awful grey tracksuit and light blue T-shirt. As an entry-level prisoner, I was not allowed my own clothes. Nor was I allowed my prison bag. I was issued with a blue plastic plate, bowl and mug and a pack of Happy Shopper tea, UHT milk and biscuits. It seemed so strange; these were my belongings in a clear plastic HMP bag.
"I was still wearing my court shoes, which made me look stupid in my tracksuit as we went to E-wing so they could process me. I was given a plate of rice and green beans and an apple. Some induction orderlies [prisoners who work on the induction wing] came to speak to me. They offered advice and some kind words, but I was a fish out of water; all I wanted to do was speak to my wife, hear her voice, for her to reassure me. I wanted to go home.
"A prison guard in the office let me make a one-minute phone call. I struggled not to cry. I told Sarah I was OK; she sounded fine, but we were both staying strong for one another. Then, clutching my cutlery, tea and biscuits and green sheets/pillowcase and orange blanket, I was sent down the hall. Because I had been processed I was meant to go to cell E403 (cell number 3 on the fourth floor). I asked a prison officer where I should go and he thought I hadn't yet been processed. He sent me over the corridor to a holding cell full of Albanians and a heroin addict in withdrawal. It was about 7pm and I could hear Channel 4 News from the TVs down the wing. I sat there on the concrete floor knowing my face was on the screens next door. The room was thick with smoke. The addict kicked the steel door repeatedly, demanding attention.
The officers ignored him. All the sounds of prison that now wash over me as ambient noise seemed so clear.
"Now I felt exhausted. A three-month trial, three-and-a-half years of bail. Years of uncertainty, years of fighting were over. At about 10pm, one officer popped his head through the door. Prisoners were coming and going as they were processed and he seemed surprised to see me.
"'Hayes! What are you doing here? You've been processed!' "I clutched my meagre belongings and followed him. I felt like a refugee with my bedding and plastic bags. Then he realised they had paired me with the addict in withdrawal. I waited for 20 minutes while they moved the addict, then they put me and another firsttimer in cell E403 together. I took the bottom bunk. The addict had taken the pillow. I made the bed. Fortunately the weather was hot, because the orange blanket was threadbare and offered no insulation at all.
"While my cellmate snored, I stared at the bunk above. My mind was racing and, although I was tired, I couldn't sleep. During the trial I had taken sleeping tablets, but I didn't have any now. Not having a watch meant I had no notion of time. Eventually the sun came up and I heard aircraft on the approach to Heathrow. I knew it must be 6am, because nothing lands before then. I had been given some milk and oats for breakfast the night before, but we had no kettle or hot water to make porridge. I rang the bell to ask for some hot water. The prison officer dismissed me. 'Wait till we unlock you,' was the response. We got unlocked at lunch."
FAREWELL TO FREEDOM
"My first exercise time in the austere concrete yard reminded me of the film Midnight Express as people circled the yard anticlockwise. I thought about the lunatic in the film who decided to go the other way and pondered what would happen if I did that. Some guys worked out, others smoked or harassed people for 'burn' (tobacco). I wandered in circles aimlessly, enjoying the sunshine and natural light.
"I think in my early days I stood out - I probably still do - but certainly some people recognised me from the media coverage. People seemed to labour under the misapprehension that I had made 'trillions' for myself. Others didn't recognise me but, seeing the court shoes, realised I was a recent arrival and inquired whether I had brought a 'package' with me. Confused and apprehensive, I told them I didn't have anything with me. I later learnt that this refers to drugs inserted up your anus. I was also told that on occasions these will be forcibly removed by other prisoners using a spoon, so I'm lucky that I didn't have a package.
"As we left the yard, one prisoner covered himself in olive oil and tried to set himself alight - his hydrocarbon knowledge wasn't the best, I thought. During my healthcare visit the nurse offered me a hepatitis B vaccination. I refused on the basis I couldn't fathom how I could catch a blood-borne virus. Later, after observing various biting incidents, I have now had my three jabs and am vaccinated.
"Just before 5pm, the cell door opened and I was ordered to gather my 'possessions' and told I was moving. Although I'm now a veteran mover, at the time I hurriedly gathered the biscuits and UHT milk, my green sheet and orange blanket and, feeling like the refugees from Syria who were all over the TV, I shuffled after the guard, bidding my cellmate a laconic goodbye. Looking back now, I feel sorry for my first cellmate. I really chewed his ear off in that first 24 hours; all the hurt and pain poured out as I paced that tiny cell. I barely listened to his problems. Although I can't recall his name, I'll be for ever grateful to him for listening and helping me through that first 24 hours.
"Confused, I asked where I was going. 'To CSU,' came the response, "Me: 'What's that?' "Prison officer: 'Care and segregation unit.' "Me: 'Why am I going there?' At this point, as we made our way down into the basement of E wing that houses the segregation unit, I felt panicked that I was being taken out of the general population to be held in isolation.
"Prison officer: 'You are a potential Category A prisoner.' "Me: 'What? I am the most unlikely Category A prisoner ever!' "Prison officer: 'You have the means to escape.' "Me: 'Escape? I've been on bail for three years!' "I later discovered I had been put in the CSU for my own protection. Because my case had been so 'high profile', it was feared I would be targeted. In fact, I was in the same cell that Max Clifford had been in a few months earlier, E010. I managed to get hold of Amanda Knox's Waiting to Be Heard and Thomas Hardy's Jude the Obscure. I couldn't watch TV. All that sitting and watching TV as a student seemed such a waste of time; now I had all the time I wanted to do nothing and watch TV, and I couldn't even turn it on except to try to figure out the time of day (I still had no watch).
"I broke the day into segments. I needed to get from breakfast to lunch, lunch to dinner, dinner to bed, to try to sleep, and I had been prescribed sleeping tablets to get me through the night. Because I was on ACCT [Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork, for prisoners considered at risk of suicide or self-harm], the light was turned on every hour to check I was still alive, and would disturb me yet further.
I don't blame the prison for that, but I operated in a bizarre dystopia, exhausted in the day, unable to sleep at night.
"I was locked up for roughly 23 hours per day in the segregation unit. Everywhere I went I was accompanied by three officers. As I walked on my own round the tiny exercise yard for 30 minutes, three prison officers looked on. I was observing the rank filth of the prison; the yard covered in rubbish thrown from the cells. It was almost as if neither prisoners nor officers really had any respect for the environment in which they lived.
"The cell was covered in graffiti, which I would idly read, trying to imagine all the people who had been in the same cell since 1851, when the prison was built.
"Being let out for any reason was a treat. A shower, collecting 'food' from the server, a healthcare appointment - anything for some form of human contact with anyone.
"I knew my mum and Sarah were going to try to visit on Wednesday morning, a reception visit allowed during the first few days. I anxiously watched the clock on the TV, having discovered the radio channel had one. I was becoming anxious. What if they had forgotten me? I was desperate to see them. At 10.15, someone came to fetch me for my visit. I breathed a sigh of relief.
"The hour flew by. I ate chocolate and drank tea from the cafÈ in the visitor sector and felt a little happier. My wife assessed the centre to see if it would be suitable to bring Josh. I had never had the chance to say a proper goodbye to him. The morning of the sentence, I had left him as normal at nursery school and not come home.
"Soon the visit ended. There were tears all round as we said our goodbyes, and Sarah hugged me.
"Even though the August weather was 25C, the basement cells at Wandsworth were freezing. The floor felt like ice. I sat on the bed and wrapped two blankets around me. You can do ten seconds of anything, I thought, so you can do this. Seven years is a lot of ten seconds, though.
"My fellow occupants of the 'Seg' were a noisy collection. Most were there as punishment and spent large amounts of time shouting and kicking the doors. My first cell had been adjacent to one such door-kicker. Now I was in a marginally quieter cell, but I was still woken by kicking at 3am.
"Shouted conversation took place between cells. I stayed quiet and listened. The speakers would be out early next year, I learnt. How I envied them.
"Being in isolation, you become attuned to the slightest sounds as you try to figure out what's happening on the other side of the door. Footsteps, the clink of keys, the near-constant shouting echoing round the old building.
"Someone from the governing board came to see me on Friday evening. Once again I appealed to him that I wanted some company.
"Governor: 'OK, but don't get yourself beaten up.' "Me: 'We have a mutual interest in that not happening.' "And so my time in CSU ended. I collected my still uneaten biscuits, tea bags and UHT milk (there are no kettles in case inmates throw boiling water at the officers), my bedding and my book and carried them back upstairs.
"I was in cell E432 on the top floor; it was considerably warmer than the basement. My new cellmate arrived on remand for a drug offence. Arrested on Wednesday and unable to shower, he stank. His obesity and the hot weather meant I regretted leaving the CSU. He stripped to his underwear; he was very hairy. He was a big TV fan and knew all the daytime programmes. He watched every soap. I tried to negotiate a slot to watch Channel 4 News between Hollyoaks, EastEnders, Emmerdale, Neighbours and Coronation Street. Instead, we agreed I could watch Newsnight at 10.30. University Challenge was rejected.
"Over the weekend the prison was shortstaffed, so we had no association time [time spent outside the cell] on either Saturday or Sunday. That meant no occasion for my new cellmate to shower. The temperature was high and, at some point, he lay down on my bed. I looked at his huge, sweaty, near-naked body lying on my bedding and felt vaguely sick.
"I kept different hours from him, choosing to go to sleep early and rise while he was asleep, snoring, to write letters in the relative calm of the early morning. I was being eaten up inside; those moments of quiet time allowed me to be alone with my thoughts and try to work out how I was going to cope with seven years of incarceration.
"I was learning a bit more about prison life; I witnessed someone getting 'bent up' [prison parlance for restrained] by the prison officers. Another officer ordered me back to my cell. When I pointed out that the commotion was taking place directly outside my cell and I had no way of returning to it, he locked me in the shower room with a paedophile killer (who claimed he had written a book that was in the library).
"Because it happened after a weekend with no association time, I needed a shower, but had no toiletries or towel and so was unable to take advantage of this unexpected situation. Instead, I was locked away with a lunatic who engaged me in conversation, inquiring about 'burn' and anything else he might be able to extract from me. The officers forgot about us. After I had banged on the door for 30 minutes, someone passed by and unlocked the door. 'What are you doing in here?' they demanded. The irony of being locked in a room by someone else, then asked how we got there, was lost on him.
"The same day saw another prisoner jump onto the netting between the landings. He refused to leave until he had a KFC. One duly arrived and, once he finished it, he came down and was removed to CSU. The prison seemed to operate on a reverse incentives system: the worse you behaved, the more you got."
LEARNING TO SURVIVE IN PRISON
"Monday came and I had now been in prison for one week. As sure as night followed day, it was now time for another cell move. I was becoming accustomed to my refugee status. This time over the corridor to E401 - it had a pillow and a kettle! My new cellmate was a nice guy called Tim. We got on well. He had a two-and-a-half-year sentence and was due to be released in February. I felt jealous, but we had plenty to talk about and he was very considerate, listening at length to my frustrations. I had my first communal shower; the facilities were very dirty. I needed to shave. I asked for a razor and some shaving foam and was told, 'Shaving foam? You're in prison now. Use soap.' The prison razor and soap left me with a bad shaving rash.
"I don't recall much about Tuesday and Wednesday; perhaps my body was coming down from operating on adrenaline. I got to speak to Sarah twice in snatched five-minute conversations. Her visit booking for Thursday hadn't been dealt with. I felt crushed.
Fortunately the chaplain came to the rescue and booked her in for a Saturday visit. It never transpired.
"On Thursday morning, the cell door was unlocked. 'Hayes, you have three minutes to pack your stuff. You're going to Nottingham.' Again I felt crushed.
"'Why Nottingham? So far from my friends and family.' "'I don't know. The decision has been made by the area officer.' "I was on my way out of Wandsworth. I said goodbye to Tim and made my way back down to reception. I changed out of the prison tracksuit I had now worn for 11 consecutive days and back into the same clothes I wore to court on August 3. As I left, the reception orderly reassured me. 'You've won the prison lottery,' he said. 'People would give their right arm to get there.' It gave me some hope, but at that time it just seemed a lot further from Sarah. I got into the prison van alone; I was the only passenger. As we went through the gatehouse at Wandsworth, I contemplated how little time I had spent there. But I was no longer a prison virgin."
"I'm sitting in the Open University room typing this, because my cell is so cold right now. I use my electric toaster to try to heat it up, but I still sit there with about five layers on. Last night, some lunatic prisoner in the wing next to mine broke a lot of pipes and flooded everything, so we were locked up with no water, hot or cold, unable to flush the toilet, in the freezing cold. The cell below me engaged in a 'dirty protest', smearing faeces everywhere, and smashing up the room, and the cell opposite had someone having a psychotic fit from taking 'spice' (synthetic cannabis), banging and shouting. I lay on my bed and wondered how I had ended up here.
"I often look at the trees on the other side of the fence from my cell; I watch the colours of the leaves change with the season and the branches blowing in the wind. I've become quite the ornithologist; I used to watch the birds at Wandsworth, too. It seems so strange that we live in the same place but they are free, able to come and go from the trees that are on the 'free' side of the fence. The wagtails sit on the razor wire and I like to see them choose from all the rubbish thrown from cell windows, searching for things to eat among the pillow cases, toilets and whatever else has been thrown out.
"I guess I'm becoming more immune to prison life now; being strip-searched has lost the embarrassment and indignity I felt at first. Drug overdoses and fights are de rigueur, and the monotony of life here takes over."
'I never had the chance to say a proper goodbye to Josh. That morning I had left him as normal and not come home'
'The light was turned on every hour to check I was alive. I was exhausted in the day, unable to sleep at night'
'I was locked in the shower room with a paedophile killer. The officers forgot us: I banged on the door for 30 minutes'

Empire of the Tsars; 
Wednesday6

Empire of the Tsars: Romanov Russia BBC Four, 9pm Lucy Worsley had not been to Russia before she made this three-part series, and it bubbles with her trademark enthusiasm and good cheer. The content - following the rise and fall of the Romanov dynasty from 1613 to its demise 300 years later - is straightforward history GCSE fare with added colour, a valuable complement to War & Peace (Sunday, BBC One, 9pm). And the story of the Romanovs is just the way she likes her history, with a roll call of larger-than-life characters filled with intrigue, betrayal, scandal, murder and much else besides. Most of tonight's programme is taken up with Peter the Great, the giant - in every sense of the word - who used his ruthless energy to transform Russia from an underdeveloped medieval backwater into a European www.power.No series by Worsley is going to be a dry affair. She gets dressed up in period costume on every possible occasion. She goes sailing in a replica of Peter the Great's flagship frigate ("Guns! 
Cannons! Ropes!" she exclaims). She drinks his favourite tipple of brandy with pepper, and relishes all the gory Romanov stories of bloodshed and torture. It is quintessential Worsley - a light, viewer-friendly history lesson illustrated by paintings, landscapes, buildings, the occasional talking head, a death mask or two and a mischievous twinkle.

Ski resorts under fire after flying in snow by helicopter.

Adam Sage.

Alpine ski resorts have been accused of an "ecological scandal" after using helicopters and lorries to move snow to barren slopes this week.
The operation infuriated environmentalists who say it has produced high levels of pollution, illustrating the harmful effects of mass tourism in the mountains.
However, ski slope managers say that the move stopped tourists getting in their cars and driving off in search of snow, which would have been far worse for the environment. 
The controversy has highlighted the woes of resorts bereft of snow after the warmest December on record in France.
The environmental row began when Sainte-Foy-Tarentaise, a resort in the Savoie dÈpartement, used helicopters to transport 100 tonnes of snow. The snow was among 100,000 cubic metres produced by cannons last month and stocked in a "snow quarry" lower down the mountain.
The helicopter made the journey 80 times, carrying just over a cubic metre of snow each time in a net hanging from a long rope.
FranÁois Piquet, the director of ski lifts in Saint-Foy-Tarentaise, where 11 of the 20 slopes are shut because of a lack of snow, said the operation cost (EURO)5,000 to and (EURO)10,000.
Anne Marmottan, the director of the resort's tourist office, said it was necessary to keep open a slope "right at the top, which risked becoming unusable. Stones were starting to poke through. If we hadn't done anything we would have had to close this slope".
She noted that 120,000 people worked in the French ski industry, and that their jobs depended upon the presence of snow. Only about 40 per cent of the seasonal workers in resorts for the winter have found employment, according to French media reports. In some resorts, staff have accepted a 30 per cent cut in working time and pay in order to keep their jobs.
Other resorts, such as Avoriaz and Carroz in the Haute-Savoie dÈpartement, and Karellis in the Savoie resorted to transporting snow this week. Jean-SÈbastien Dorel, director of the Karellis resort, which used a helicopter to take 32 tonnes of snow from upper slopes to lower ones, said: "Helicopters are a means of transport that are totally suitable for mountains.
"In terms of pollution, this is a snowflake in an avalanche. If we found ourselves in exactly the same situation next year, we would do the same thing."
HervÈ Billard, head of the snow committee at the RhÙne-Alpes Federation for the Protection of Nature, described the use of helicopters as an "ecological scandal".
He said: "This shows that we are heading into a dead end by trying to offer all tourists the same leisure activities. Transport by helicopter costs money and pollutes." Helicopters consume about 30 litres of fuel an hour, and emit far higher levels of greenhouse gases than cars. The ultra-chic resort of Courchevel in the Savoie department said it had not used helicopters to shift snow but instead employed lorries to carry out a total of 200 journeys.
The vehicles moved artificial snow produced by the resort's 588 cannons for a World Cup skiing event which was held there on December 20, taking it to slopes used by tourists.
Officials fear that with fewer pistes in operation, the remaining ones will be even more crowded than usual, creating danger for skiers. Doctors have also warned that slopes covered with artificial snow tend to be icier.

'Ethical' investments can be a minefield.

Mark Bridge.

? Follow us on TWITTER @timesmoney @anneashworth @mbridge82 Today's section is packed with stories to help you to get your finances sorted this new year, including our ten-step guide on pages 54-55 and articles covering mortgages, savings, pensions and investments in depth.
On the facing page we look at ethical investing. There is tremendous demand now for "good" investments. However, many investors have a niggling belief that nasties are where the money's at. After all, the star fund manager Neil Woodford's equity income fund has Imperial Tobacco, maker of Lambert & Butler and Gauloises, as its No 1 holding. 
Tobacco companies tend to be top dividend payers, and while smoking rates are in decline in much of the West, they are targeting new markets in the developing world, where smoking is perceived as Western and "cool". They are also trying to develop technologies such as "heat not burn" cigarettes that may or may not be safer than traditional products.
Whatever. Having lost close relatives to smoking, it is not an industry I would choose to invest in. Likewise, I wouldn't invest in arms manufacturers such as BAE Systems. However, I would happily invest in booze companies because I don't believe alcohol is inherently bad - plenty of people derive pleasure, with no downside, from the odd pint or glass of wine. I have directly invested in a gambling firm too, an Aim-listed spread-betting site, because I think anyone who chooses to spread-bet should understand the risks.
That's sharing some of the things I'm OK and not OK with. I am sure many readers will disagree with my morals and logic, and that's one of the main issues with ethics in personal finance. There are no fixed criteria, so one fund manager or company or commentator's idea of what's "good" will be very different from another's.
If you want to invest ethically, you need to scrutinise how different companies and the funds that invest in them fit your personal beliefs.
I'll admit to not being very green and have been sceptical on some claims around climate change (although the mild December weather has unnerved me), so I don't mind funds that invest in fossil fuel players such as Shell.
However, I'm sure many people would be surprised that these companies can be significant holdings in funds that are sold as ethical. The dubious justification is that the companies also work with renewables or some managers argue they can work from the inside to put pressure on the board to effect change. Ethical funds also invest in big banks that have been implicated in all sorts of scandals, and sometimes brewers. I'm not aware of any that hold tobacco or arms.
The market in ethical funds is fairly new, so the long-term picture is hard to gauge. However, research suggests that these funds, which mostly do screen out the worst companies at least, may perform better than other funds in the short to medium term.
That's good news.
The lure of childhood One TV programme I watched over Christmas was Channel 4's countdown of Britain's 100 Best Children's Books. As with any list of the sort, I would dispute some of the choices and rankings but was pleased to see The House at Pooh Corner take the top spot, and The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe in second place.
Yes, lovely, but what has this got to do with money? Plenty, actually, because the market for first-edition children's books, original illustrations and related memorabilia is booming.
Sotheby's New York held a selling exhibition last month of original watercolour illustrations at fixed prices up to $950,000 apiece by the author and illustrator Maurice Sendak, best known for Where the Wild Things Are, published in 1963.
It is common knowledge that first editions of the first Harry Potter book sell for large sums: north of £20,000 for an ordinary copy, while a copy with annotations and hand drawings by the author fetched £150,000 in 2013.
There is great material at lower prices, though. Original cover art for the 1970 Rupert Bear annual made £6,875 at Bonhams in a recent sale, exceeding a presale estimate of £2,000 to £4,000. That's not cheap, but the painting would transform a room and give pleasure for generations.
A presentation copy of The House at Pooh Corner signed by EH Shepard and one of a limited edition of 350 fetched £1,500 in the same sale.

Sir Brian Tovey; 
Controversial director of GCHQ who predicted the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968

Brian Tovey retired early from the directorship of the Government Communications Headquarters when the arrangement governing the exchange of intelligence between the United States and Britain was under threat because of the conviction of the Soviet "mole" Geoffrey Prime.
At the same time, the morale of GCHQ staff was soured by rumours that they might be subjected to polygraph (lie detector) checks and denied trades union membership after the security breach.
Tovey "fell on his sword" after spending the whole of his professional life with the espionage agency.
Further controversy was not far away, however. After advising Margaret Thatcher, the prime minister, in his last year at GCHQ that the organisation would succeed only if it used the best technology available, he caused further controversy by taking up several positions with high-technology companies. 
The Geoffrey Prime security scandal broke in 1981 with revelations that he had, among other things, informed the Soviet security service, the KGB, about the Anglo-American system for tracking their nuclear submarines. The US then demanded that GCHQ's vetting and security procedures be reviewed and tightened.
The Americans were shocked by the ease with which Prime had been able to extract top-secret material emanating from both US and British intelligencegathering sources. The spy was uncovered only when police searched his home while investigating an assault on a 14-year-old girl.
Tovey was never in doubt about the seriousness of what had happened. Concern grew when it was discovered that Prime had retained copies of 500 documents after leaving GCHQ and handed them over to the KGB in two batches in May 1980 and November 1981. The director of GCHQ resolved to set things right no matter what the cost.
During meetings in Washington and London in 1983 to discuss improved security arrangements, the US Central Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency - the American equivalent of GCHQ - suggested polygraph testing for current and future employees, a practice that was routine in the US. While he had anticipated this proposal, Tovey was sceptical of the effectiveness of the procedure, which had a 14 per cent fail rate, and knew its introduction would not help already troubled staff relations.
The polygraph proposal was followed in January 1984 by a confrontation between the Trades Union Congress and Thatcher over whether GCHQ staff should be allowed to belong to a union. Tovey handled the two closely interwoven issues with skill and tact - as well as an acute appreciation of the risks involved.
In 1981, the TUC had identified the issue of union membership at GCHQ as a lever against the industrial reforms that the Thatcher government was planning. Tovey advised the Commons employment select committee that the offer of a no-strike deal by Len Murray, general secretary of the TUC, would be preferable to an outright ban on union membership, which might lead to the loss of key staff. On the other issue, the TUC resolutely opposed the possibility of polygraph testing and with good reason. The Royal Commission on Criminal Justice Procedure had recently concluded that the device entailed a high chance of an honest individual being branded a security risk - or a malcontent slipping through.
At this moment, having advocated financial compensation for loss of union rights and expressed doubts about the effectiveness of polygraph testing, Tovey chose to announce his early retirement.
According to insiders, he was highly respected on both sides of the Atlantic and regarded as being intensely loyal to colleagues in the intelligence community. Allowing the new director a fresh start was his expressed reason for retiring at the age of 57, three years before his retirement date.
Circumstances in his personal life may also have played a part. Having left GCHQ in September 1983, he moved out of the family home in Cheltenham three months later, announcing that he and his third wife had separated.
Tovey was married four times. He married his first wife, Elizabeth Christopher, in 1949 and they had four children - a son and three daughters - before they separated in 1959: Dominic is now working for IBM; Helen is a professor of medieval literature at Bristol university; and Catherine, is a doctor of social work at the University of Newcastle in New South Wales, Australia. His eldest daughter, Anne, predeceased him.
Living alone in Cheltenham and working in an essentially secluded society, he naturally sought female company, but, unlike many men, and probably out of a sense of propriety, he usually married his girlfriends. Two marriages, in 1961 and 1973, ended in divorce after periods of about ten years. His marriage in 1989 to Mary Lane proved both happy and lasting. She survives him.
Brian John Maynard Tovey was the son of the Rev John Tovey, a canon of Bermuda Cathedral, and educated at St Edward's School and St Edmund Hall, Oxford. He served in the Royal Navy and then the Army Intelligence Corps between 1945 and 1948 before taking his BA in modern Chinese at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London and joining GCHQ two years later.
Twice in mid-career Tovey scored marked success as an analyst of signal intelligence (SIGINT). During the Indonesian "confrontation" with the Malayan Federation, instituted by President Sukarno in 1963, Tovey was the GCHQ representative on the Joint Intelligence Committee Far East, responsible for the presentation of signal intelligence to the Security Service (MI5), the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) and military intelligence staffs in Singapore. SIGINT coverage was highly effective and Tovey was able to plot the deployment of the Indonesian forces with a degree of accuracy that left Sukarno's naval, air and ground force commanders outmanoeuvred.
Five years later, as Head of "J" Division at Cheltenham, responsible for special SIGINT on the forces of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact, he was in receipt of satellite-acquired photographic intelligence from the CIA. This added a visual dimension to the signal intelligence on Warsaw Pact formation deployments in and out of their bases in Russia and eastern Europe.
When Alexander Dubcek's "Prague Spring" of 1968 threatened to loosen Czechoslovakia's central position in the Warsaw Pact military stance across Europe, Tovey moved his "J" Division into overdrive. Using the CIA's satellite intelligence as collateral, he plotted the moves of Soviet and Warsaw Pact divisions to the Czech borders meticulously; only one Soviet tank division from the Murmansk military district briefly escaped detection - as it was transported at night by rail under radio silence.
A quietly spoken man, Tovey had a subtle sense of humour. He was much amused to hear that when his assessment of the Warsaw Pact deployment around Czechoslovakia was presented to the Current Intelligence Group, the chairman asked the Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS) representative if he thought an invasion of Czechoslovakia was imminent. "It will take only a hand on the shoulder of the commander of the Guards Tank Division at Altenberg at midnight for his tanks to trundle into Prague at first light," came the reply. The chairman laughed and asked, "You don't really think they would be mad enough to invade, do you?" Forty-eight hours later they did so.
The subsequent inquiry found that the DIS working on intelligence from Tovey's "J" Division and the CIA had been correct, whereas the Foreign Office and MI6 had based their conclusions on Western rather than Russian logic. Tovey emerged from the Czechoslovak crisis with his already formid-able reputation enhanced and generously sent a message to his Cheltenham staff, congratulating them on their achievements.
In his final year as director of GCHQ, Tovey had been able to persuade Thatcher that the agency would continue to be successful only if its technology could match the development of telecommunications worldwide. Although the British spy satellite programme Zircon, which was the first fruit of Thatcher's commitment, was ultimately cancelled on the ground of costs, it began a process of re-educating GCHQ's staff to understand that, as at Bletchley Park during the Second World War, technology was at the heart of the organisation's mission.
After his retirement, a new controversy arose when it was revealed that Tovey was advising companies how to keep their commercial communications secure when he had devoted his entire professional life to tapping into other people's messages. He freely acknowledged this contradiction, but pointed out that technology would always be leaping ahead.
Tovey became defence and political adviser to Plessey Defence Systems Ltd from 1983 to 1985, chairman of IES Group plc from 1993 to 1998, and vice-president (information and communication technology) of the Federation of the Electronics Industry from 1995 to 1997, as well as taking up a number of other advisory appointments.
On his appointment at Plessey, Alistair Graham, general secretary of the Civil and Public Services Association, said Tovey had "a brass neck" to be associated with the company and "should be banned" from visiting GCHQ.
He returned to live in Oxford and devoted much of his time to the study of the historical methodology of the 17th- century Italian Filippo Baldinucci, who is considered to be among the most significant Florentine biographerhistorians of the arts of the baroque period. From an 8,500 card index on Baldinucci's six-volume work, Notizie dei Professori del Disegno da Cimabue in qua, compiled by Philip Pouncey, who had worked at Bletchley Park, he published The Pouncey Index of Baldinucci's Notizie in 2005. The book launch was in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence.
Tovey was a regular contributor to the Gazette des Beaux-Art, the Art Newspaper and the Journal of the Society for Renaissance Studies. His unashamedly florid style, when lecturing as a visiting fellow at the British Institute of Florence, and on paper, conveyed his very effective grasp of a wide range of subjects. He was always energetic and full of enthusiasm; his love of Italy and a glass of chianti classico with lunch and dinner remained with him to the end.

City trader breaks silence on life behind bars.

Harry Wilson.

The City trader jailed for rigging interest rates has broken his silence to give his account of life in prison since he was found guilty in the summer.
Writing in a series of letters to The Times, Tom Hayes said that he had been locked up with drug addicts and murderers. 
Describing his life at HMP Lowdham Grange, a prison close to Nottingham where he studied mathematics at university before embarking on a career in banking, Hayes, who once earned nearly £2 million in a year, said that he had been forced to rely on an electric toaster to heat his cell.
"I'm sitting in the Open University room typing this, because my cell is so cold right now ... last night, some lunatic prisoner in the wing next to mine broke a lot of pipes and flooded everything, so we were locked up with no water, hot or cold, unable to flush the toilet, in the freezing cold," he wrote.
The former UBS and Citigroup banker, now serving 11 years, said that he had begun to study for an economics and mathematics distance-learning degree from the London School of Economics and had become used to jail.
"I guess I'm becoming more immune to prison life now; being strip-searched has lost the embarrassment and indignity I felt at first. Drug overdoses and fights are de rigueur," he wrote.
Writing of the time that he was convicted on August 3, 2015 after a threemonth trial over his role in the Libor scandal, Hayes said that he was initially accidentally placed in a holding pen with a recovering heroin addict before prison officers at HMP Wandsworth realised their mistake.
"It was about 7pm and I could hear Channel 4 News from the TVs down the wing. I sat there on the concrete floor knowing my face was on the screens next door.
"The room was thick with smoke. The addict kicked the steel door repeatedly, demanding attention. The officers ignored him," he wrote.
The Serious Fraud Office is pursuing a confiscation order against Hayes and his wife, Sarah, a corporate lawyer, arguing that his assets, including the family home, represent the proceeds of crime.
Hayes was convicted by a jury for rate manipulation after the SFO prosecuted him for his actions in Tokyo where he worked as a yen derivatives trader, first at UBS and then at Citigroup.
Libor is the estimated interest rate that leading banks would pay if they borrowed from one another. It is one of the world's most important financial benchmarks and is used to price assets worth trillions of pounds.
In July 2012, Barclays became the first bank to admit its part in attempts to manipulate Libor in a range of currencies, including sterling and the US dollar.
Nearly every major global investment bank has now paid fines to UK and American regulators over Liborrigging with the total penalties imposed coming close to $10 billion (£7 billion). On top of this, banks face a raft of civil claims, although so far there has yet to be a major court case. Most of the lawsuits have been settled in private before a public trial.

Read Kipling instead of pulling down statues; 
Arguments about Britain's colonial legacy should be about remembering history, not destroying reminders of it

Few people know that If - (Britain's favourite poem, according to a BBC poll) is a paean to Sir Leander Starr Jameson, the buccaneering Scottish-born politician who led the unsuccessful Jameson Raid in South Africa in 1895. His raid was conceived and financed by Cecil Rhodes, powerful head of the British South Africa Company, who wanted to bring the Transvaal and its gold mines under British control. But first it helped to spark the devastating second Boer War.
The poem was penned by Rudyard Kipling, who was born in Bombay, India, 150 years ago this week. From these origins, he become one of the first truly international writers, spanning continents in fiction that ranged from Kim, his panoramic novel about India, to The Gardener, his sensitive story about a woman's visit to a First World War grave. 
Awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1907, Kipling also had a gift for controversy, largely because, as a result of his apprenticeship in India, he became a strong advocate for the British Empire. A Gladstonian liberal as a teenager, he came to admire the dedication of the soldiers, engineers and administrators who, as he saw it, were bringing health, justice and stability to the Raj.
This enthusiasm, amounting to obsession, for the empire, led him to befriend Rhodes. He often wintered with his family at The Woolsack, a house on Rhodes's estate in Cape Town. He was there during the Boer War, which he had promoted with his recruiting song The Absent-Minded Beggar. He was there when Rhodes died in 1902, and he wrote a commemorative poem, The Burial, lines from which are still found below the bust of his hero in the Rhodes Memorial above Cape Town. Another quotation from Kipling (from The Song of the Cities) adorned the Rhodes statue removed from the University of Cape Town campus in April 2015. The two men couldn't have been closer, though Rhodes was the activist, and Kipling the wordsmith.
So far as I know, no one has suggested banning Kipling. But in the past he has endured long periods of disapproval and often censorship (now beginning to shift), when commentators, spurred on by George Orwell in a famous essay in 1942, felt it easier to condemn Kipling for his conservative and often dubious politics than to acknowledge his literary brilliance.
Banning or destroying cultural artefacts is unhelpful. And one good reason is that they are part of the fabric of our history, which the Rhodes Must Fall (RMF) movement understandably seeks to question and reinterpret in a campaign that has now reached Oxford.
In this context, its members could do worse than to read Kipling. Not only are his works suffused with an extraordinary awareness of the past, but also his life was a testament to the tectonic movements of history. How could that not be for a man (1865-1936) who straddled the 19th and 20th centuries, observing - from vantage points in Asia, North America, Africa and Europe - the subtle changes from Victorianism to modernism (the stuff of some of his hitherto neglected late stories)? At each stage in his career Kipling wrestled with and documented the major issues of the day. As a young journalist in his native India, he pilloried the hypocrisies of the Raj elite, notably in Plain Tales from the Hills. He warned against the dangers of imperial hubris in stories such as The Man Who Would Be King. And he chronicled the highs and lows of the British soldiers he had met in India in his Barrack-Room Ballads, first published in 1890, when he returned to make his name in London.
Back in Sussex after the Boer War, he at last found the settled home that he craved. There, along with typical poetic tirades about Ulster, the Marconi scandal and the growing German threat, he took a gentler approach to Britain's (particularly England's) history, and its subtle relationship to landscape and myth, in his Puck of Pook's Hill stories.
However the RMF lobby is onto something. Like Kipling in those stories, we do need to interrogate our past; the histories of slavery and the Raj are being rewritten. We just shouldn't destroy the evidence.
As for Kipling himself, I know of busts, but no full effigy. He did write about statues, though, notably in his poem Buddha at Kamkura, about a vast idol he encounteredin Japan, sparking this ecumenical thought: O ye who tread the Narrow Way By Tophet-flare to Judgment Day, Be gentle when "the heathen" pray To Buddha at Kamakura.
In 1897, at the height of his imperialism, Kipling wrote another poem, Recessional, which commemorated Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee, not with paroxysms of enthusiasm, but with sobering words about the responsibilities of power (a favourite theme): Far-called, our navies melt away; On dune and headland sinks the fire; Lo, all our pomp of yesterday Is one with Nineveh and Tyre! Judge of the Nations, spare us yet, Lest we forget - lest we forget!' That final line is worth bearing in mind. As often noted, those who cannot remember their past are condemned to repeat it. But for the time being at least, aspects of that pomp remain, with its statues and sometimes vainglorious poetry - altogether an inextricable part of our history.

FCA 'lets banks off the hook'; 
Accusations fly as City watchdog drops key investigations

Harry Wilson, Patrick Hosking The City watchdog has dropped two more investigations into the financial services industry, The Times has learnt, after a review into the sector's culture was also abandoned. 
Amid accusations that regulators have gone easy on big banks , the Financial Conduct Authority has closed a study into the way lenders incentivise their staff to sell financial products and is set to shelve an investigation of how insurers use customer information. News that the inquiries were being dropped comes just nine months after it announced them in its business plan.
The decisions follow the ousting in July of Martin Wheatley, chief executive of the FCA, who George Osborne regarded as being too harsh on the City. The chancellor has made several changes since the Tory election victory in May that have been regarded as softening the government's relationship with the City. This follows a first term in office characterised by new regulations amid a wave of financial scandals.
However, the Treasury was forced to deny it had played any part in scrapping the banking culture review, saying the decision had been taken by the FCA, set up by Mr Osborne after he abolished the Financial Services Authority. "This decision by the independent FCA reflects its view that the best way of doing this is for it to support individual firms to bring about change within their organisations," a spokeswoman said. The denial failed to dent criticism that the authorities were being more accommodative to the City. "We are sliding back into the mentality that produced the crisis. It is the flawed culture of banking that lies at the root of the spectrum of appalling behaviour," Stephen Platt, an expert on financial crime and adjunct professor of law at Georgetown University, said.
Among changes favouring the banks are alterations to an industry levy, a U-turn on a rule forcing executives to prove they were not negligent in the event of a financial crash and watering down of the "ring-fence" requirement that forces big lenders to separate their retail and investment banking arms.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mark Garnier, a Conservative member of the Treasury select committee, said that he was "disappointed" by the move to abandon the review. "If I was looking for a Machiavellian plot behind what's happened here and the tone of the regulator, then I suppose I would start looking at the Treasury," he said.
Tracey McDermott, interim chief executive of the FCA, personally authorised the closure of the investigations. She is among several applicants to run the watchdog, with Mr Osborne expected to make a choice within months. Other candidates for the £460,000-ayear post are said to include Dame Nemat Shafik, deputy governor of the Bank of England, and Greg Medcraft, chairman of Australia's financial regulator.
Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, said that, in the absence of the review, it remained crucial that regulators continued to push banks to change their ways.
"It is essential that both the regulated community and the FCA fully implement the proposals of the banking commission. Only that way can it be shown that higher standards are now in place that will do more than any number of further reviews," he said.

Carry on Cameron: voters demand four more years; 
Times poll REJECTS rivals as PM vows to beat poverty and extremism.

Sam Coates.

David Cameron insists today that Britain is in the middle of one of the "great reforming decades" as a poll by The Times reveals that voters want him to remain in Downing Street until 2020.
The survey comes as the prime minister sets out his longterm vision for transforming Britain, saying that he will seek to alleviate poverty, increase social mobility, tackle extremism and promote home ownership.
Mr Cameron's message will be seen as an attempt to alleviate fears among some Tory MPs that the coming year will be dominated by the looming European Union referendum and speculation over the Conservative leadership race. 
The prime minister said in March that he would not seek a third term, prompting concern among some supporters that he would end up as a lame-duck leader. He has repeatedly refused to set out a timetable for his departure, saying that he has a packed domestic agenda to complete.
A State of the Nation YouGov poll for The Times indicates today that 55 per cent of Tory voters want him to delay his departure until just before the 2020 election at the earliest. Of those, 22 per cent want him to break his vow and seek to serve a third term. Only 15 per cent of Tory voters are urging him to leave office before 2019.
Among the wider electorate, 37 per cent of voters want Mr Cameron to remain as leader until the 2020 election. Eleven per cent want him to stay longer. Only 32 per cent want him to stand down before 2019.
In his message today, Mr Cameron highlights challenges that he wants to address, including the "scandal" that there are more young black men in prison than studying at Britain's top universities, which he says is caused by poor schooling, discrimination and, in some cases, the effect of extremism.
Mr Cameron will use a new-year article on the ConservativeHome website to say that he has not given up on the need for reform. "I genuinely believe we are in the middle of one of the great reforming decades in our history - what I would call a 'turnaround decade', where we can use the platform of our renewed economic strength to go for real social renewal. So here are the things I want to get done."
His approach echoes that taken by Continued on page 2, col 5 Continued from page 1 Tony Blair, who promised to leave after the 2005 election, but said later that he needed more time for domestic reforms.
The poll makes worrying reading for George Osborne. Among the public, Boris Johnson was the most popular choice to succeed Mr Cameron, backed by 25 per cent of those asked, followed by Theresa May, the home secretary, on 15 per cent. The chancellor was third on 13 per cent.
The race is closer among Tory voters, however, with the London mayor on 31 per cent, Mr Osborne on 29 per cent, and Mrs May on 21 per cent.
The poll also found Jeremy Corbyn looking more secure as Labour leader, with the proportion who think that he should step down before the election dropping from 53 per cent in September to 47 per cent now. Among Labour voters 58 per cent want him to stay and 33 per cent want him to step down.
The YouGov poll put the European referendum almost neck and neck, with 41 per cent of respondents wanting to remain and 42 per cent in favour of leaving. Expectations for the renegotiation remain low: only 9 per cent think significant change likely; most expect only a few tweaks. A clear majority of people expect Britain to end up voting to stay.

Honourable calling

Sir, Your editorial ("A Question of Honour", Dec 31) rightly observes that "pleas for radical reform of the system have gone largely unheeded". The Commons public administration committee has undertaken two inquiries into the system and recommended major reforms, including the establishment of an independent honours commission with clear criteria for the award of honours based upon exceptional service or achievement. Is it too much to hope that justified public outrage at some of the names on the latest list might finally produce the reform that is so obviously needed? professor tony wright Former MP and chairman of the public administration select committee 1999-2010, Birmingham Sir, Lynton Crosby's knighthood needs to be seen in historical context (reports, Dec 31). It continues the practice, which goes back to the late 19th century, of honouring the most senior figure in the party's central office after election victory. Until 20 years ago that person was always a highly experienced professional party agent who had given years of service for modest financial reward. The decline of the party's organisation has ended that fine tradition and engulfed what remains of it in scandal. Lynton Crosby, who was paid a vast salary, has probably never set foot in a Tory constituency office outside www.London.No wonder his honour has aroused such widespread criticism.  
lord lexden Director of the Conservative Political Centre 1988-97 Sir, Your leading article lists the abysmal performance of Lin Homer in no less than four very high profile government posts, and expresses surprise that, in view of this performance, she has been awarded Dame Commander of the Order of the Bath. I am left wondering, in addition, who on earth appointed her to these later posts, given her appalling track record? Presumably they too have received honours for their "outstanding contribution to public service".

Regulator must not return to being City's cheerleader; 
Patrick Hosking Comment

With every week comes evidence that ministers and regulators are softening their approach to bankers and the City.
The revelation that the Financial Conduct Authority is dropping two reviews announced in April and is having second thoughts about a third is the latest concession to a compliance-weary financial services industry. 
Since the general election in May, we have seen the planned axing of the bank levy, the relaxing of rules on capital, a significant U-turn on banker accountability - the dropping of the so-called reverse burden of proof - and, of course, the sacking of the person regarded as bank-basher-in-chief, Martin Wheatley, the FCA's chief executive.
Tracey McDermott, his interim successor and an applicant for the post, has made plain she is dialling things down. The immense increase in the regulatory workload in every City firm risks stifling innovation and competition, she argues.
But she has also sniffed the wind from Downing Street, where George Osborne has talked of a need for "a new settlement" with the City. He seems to have been rattled by HSBC's threat to leave the UK.
Many will argue that the banks, while paying lip service to the need for reform, haven't changed. This week Barclays was fined $13.75m by US regulators for disadvantaging clients last June, three years after it started spouting platitudes about its new ethical approach.
Many will say the incentives given to middle managers - the subJect of one of the abandoned reviews - go to the heart of the rottenness in banking, explaining everything from market rigging to PPI mis-selling.
A review might have shed useful light on the management philosophy still adopted by senior bankers with no better ideas: put your middle managers on highly geared sales incentives then stand back, hold your nose and look the other way.
Instead, the FCA will seek to push through reform behind the scenes. Good luck with that. If anything has driven better behaviour in the past few years it is the very public shaming of misbehaving banks? Until 2012 the former Financial Services Authority was obliged to "have regard" for the international competitiveness of London. That requirement was rightly dropped. The City needs cheerleaders but it's not a Job for the regulator.
The FCA needs to be careful it doesn't regain the FSA's reputation as the City's poodle.
And it needs to get out of the bad habit of concealing the cancellation of initiatives whose launch it has previously publicly trumpeted.

Costs leak nearly sunk Holyrood PROJECT

Donald Dewar expressed private fears that the Holyrood parliament building PROJECT might have to be scrapped after news of its spiralling costs was leaked to the public (Marc Horne writes). 
Scotland's inaugural first minister, above, was instrumental in choosing the location of the new legislature and appointing Enric Miralles, the experimental Catalan architect, to create it.
However, newly released files show that the Scottish Labour leader feared that news of the soaring cost had turned public opinion, and a MAJORITY of MSPs, against his showpiece PROJECT.
Shortly after Mr Dewar first announced "There shall be a Scottish parliament", a 1997 government white paper stated that it could be built for as little as £10 million.
Newly elected MSPs narrowly voted by 64 to 61 in 1999 to continue with the PROJECT.
However, one year later the first minister became anxious and alarmed when news of delays and massively escalating costs reaching £109 million first appeared in the press.
Notes from a cabinet discussion of the issue state: "The Holyrood PROJECT was only endorsed by a MAJORITY of three the last time parliament debated the issue.
"It might be difficult to save it again unless it could be shown that it could now be delivered within a reasonable budget and that a decision to abandon the PROJECT would involve very substantial mitigating expenditure."
The previously unpublished documents state: "The first minister referred to the recent media coverage concerning the significant increase in the estimated cost of the new parliament building at Holyrood. He said such leaks made the business of government very difficult and were deeply damaging.
"The first minister said there was no truth in the allegations that he had sought to conceal the true cost of the new parliament."
It notes that Mr Dewar's cabinet agreed to adopt a more "aggressive stance" and would seek to distance itself from the growing scandal, stating: "The executive is being blamed for something which was not its responsibility."

High drama played out on world stage

It was a year defined by the journeys of hundreds of thousands of migrants risking everything to reach the promised lands of Europe - and by the brutality of Islamic State (Catherine Philp writes). Perhaps no single image brought those two stories together more than that of a Turkish policeman tenderly retrieving the body of three-yearold Aylan Kurdi from the seashore after his family's journey came to a tragic end. 
The shocking image cast a spotlight on the plight of Syrian refugees, persuaded Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, to open the country's doors to them - prompting a continent-wide crisis - and possibly changed the course of an election in Canada, the country where the Kurdi family had dreamt of settling. The family came from Kobani, the Kurdish town in Syria that Isis tried and failed to take as part of its imagined caliphate.
Elsewhere, the jihadists began a systematic campaign to erase pre-Islamic culture, destroying buildings and artefacts, from the Greco-Roman ruins at Palmyra to the Assyrian cities of northern Iraq.
Paris suffered its second big terrorist attack of the year when Isis militants rampaged through the city in November, killing 129 people and prompting expressions of solidarity around the world with France.
There was global outrage, too, at the killing of Cecil, a Zimbabwean lion, by an American dentist who then received death threats and was forced into hiding.
Andreas Lubitz deliberately crashed his Germanwings jet on March 24 The dramatic fall from grace of Sepp Blatter, the Fifa chairman dogged by corruption allegations, was, many felt, inevitable.

Get set for rocky ride as rate rises hammer risky emerging markets; 
World growth is expected to recover after leading economies put the financial crisis behind them but threats remain and a bad case of Jitters is inevitable

Volatility and uncertainty will be the watchwords of 2016 as investors and policymakers grapple with rising US interest rates and a slowdown in emerging markets.
World growth is forecast to edge up from 3.1 per cent to 3.6 per cent, according to the International Monetary Fund, as advanced economies put the financial crisis behind them. December's US rate rise is expected to foreshadow further tightening in America as well as the UK. At the same time, the eurozone recovery is forecast to stabilise with growth of around 1.6 per cent.
Risk has shifted to the developing world, where there are fears of a sovereign debt default in Latin America or Asia as capital floods back to advanced nations and currencies tumble in the face of higher US rates.
China remains the big threat as Beijing grapples with the transition from investment to consumption-led growth. At the same time, emerging markets will have to contend with the high levels of debt. 
Although world growth is expected to recover from last year -the weakest since the recession of 2009 - risks are thought to be greater than 12 months ago. The IMF has warned that downside risks are potent. Deflation is rearing its head again, emerging markets may struggle and markets are expected to be jittery.

Tom Donohue, president and chief executive of the US Chamber of Commerce, has said that Mr Trump "will be a positive participant ... for a while". Those words "for a while" tell us all we need to know about how the business community views Mr Trump's increasingly intemperate statements.
Plenty of technology unicorns will turn into donkeys, but not Uber, which will continue to grow like Topsy. Silicon Valley venture capitalists will continue to pile into biotech companies. Merger activity will continue apace, although at a slightly lower rate than last year, as companies that have already cut costs to the bone seek growth through acquisition. General Motors will finally agree to buy Fiat Chrysler. More US companies will seek lower tax bases abroad and there will be little the government can do to stop them.
Apple will surprise us either with a new product or by buying Tesla - at a stroke using up its cash pile and creating a new accessory (albeit a big one) for the iPhone.
In retail, Sears, which used to be known as America's Department Store, will run out of assets to sell off and will eventually collapse.
The fallout from energy deflation will continue unabated, thanks to Opec's decision in December not to reduce production, hitting producers and oil services companies hard.
The oil price bears at Goldman Sachs do not expect a rebound or even stabilisation this year and even suggest that oil could sink to $20.
America's shale frackers have been finding new ways to squeeze more oil and gas from the wells they service, but at that price what's the point? Lower energy costs will continue to depress inflation and ensure that, after raising rates in December, the Federal Reserve will move very gradually on subsequent increases.
GDP growth will be modest, but real, coming in at around 2.8 per cent for the full year, thanks to continued expansion in the services and consumer economies. However, earnings growth will continue to remain subdued. On Wall Street, markets will tread water for a second consecutive year.
Calum MacLeod BeiJing 2016 2015 China 6.3 1.8 4.1 46 GDP growth Inflation Unemployment Debt as % of GDP 6.8 1.5 4.1 43.1 China's Communist Party boss Xi Jinping received a lavish London welcome in October, as British officials and businesses saw the country's economic might shoring up creaky British infrastructure - and paying up for British exports.
While the middle class in the Middle Kingdom kept on swelling and consuming in 2015, the nation's oncestellar growth continued its dramatic downward trend, raising serious questions about China's economic health and how it may restrain global growth.
If you believe official Chinese numbers, which some analysts suggest may overstate GDP by as much as 2 percentage points, the world's second largest economy should achieve its GDP growth target of "about 7 per cent" this year.
China shocked the world last year with stock market crashes and a surprise devaluation of its "people's currency". The yuan finally joined the IMF's elite basket of reserve currencies, but many economists still doubt it will overtake the dollar as the world's most used reserve currency in the next 50 years.
This year - the year of the monkey - growth may slow to around 6 per cent. The economy has become decidedly two-speed, with industry slumping while services do well. Higher consumption has largely offset the poor performance of traditional industries.
To hit the desired rate of 6.5 per cent growth on average over the next five years, the parameters of China's next and still important fiveyear plan, Beijing must take decisive action on tackling highly indebted local government and corporate sectors.
To make rising consumption a key driver of growth, as the economy moves away from over-reliance on state-led investment, China also needs to allow more private investment in sectors still dominated by state-owned industries. Major reforms have been a long time coming.
David Charter Berlin 2016 2015 Eurozone 1.6 1 10.5 92.8 GDP growth Inflation Unemployment Debt as % of GDP 1.5 0.2 11 93.7 A year of printing money lies ahead for the eurozone in the battle to avoid deflation and encourage a tentative recovery which should continue to see a gradual drop in both unemployment and the euro alike.
This could also be the year that the single currency finally reaches parity with the dollar if, as expected, central bank interest rates head in opposite directions on either side of the Atlantic.
There are signs that inflation is stirring from its moribund headline rate of 0.1 per cent, with core inflation at around 1 per cent once the falling fuel price is stripped out.
This hint of a better tomorrow may explain why the European Central Bank opted for an underwhelming extension of its (EURO)60 billion-a-month stimulus spending programme and shaved another 0.1 per cent off the bank deposit rate at its last board meeting of 2015 rather than making any more dramatic moves.
The ECB will continue with quantitative easing until at least March 2017 despite fears at the bank that it will simply give national governments yet another reason to put off tough structural reforms.
If Europe remains focused on migration and terrorism, there will be even less incentive to reform, despite an election-free year in France, which needs modernisation more than most.
One thing will therefore not change in 2016 - Mario Draghi, the ECB president, will complain at every press conference that governments are not doing enough to shake up their economies to put the eurozone on a sounder footing.
The year will begin with the ECB's record-low bank deposit rate of minus 0.3 per cent and base rate of 0.05 per cent. They are unlikely to rise over 2016 given the minimal impact so far of other stimulus measures such as QE and the sinking oil price.
Despite the weaker euro's positive impact on exports, there could be trouble ahead. The slowdown in China and problems in emerging markets affect around 25 per cent of eurozone exports, with the greatest impact on Germany, France, Italy, and Spain - the biggest economies.
Another problem to watch out for in 2016 will be Greece, as it attempts to stick to a tough reform programme in return for regular loans to help keep it in the single currency.
Finally, at some point in 2016, eurozone GDP should top the previous peak it reached in 2008 before the financial crisis. This should encourage policymakers to reflect on why it took the eurozone eight years to achieve what the US did in four.
Tom Parfitt Moscow 2016 2015 Russia -0.6 8.6 6.5 21 GDP growth Inflation Unemployment Debt as % of GDP -3.8 15.8 6 20.4 After a severe slump in the past year under the weight of sanctions, low oil prices and a plummeting rouble, a degree of stabilisation is expected in Russia's economy in 2016.
The International Monetary Fund predicted in December that Russian GDP would shrink by 0.6 per cent this year compared with a nasty 3.8 per cent contraction in 2015.
Inflation rates are expected to decline as the year proceeds.
Yet Russia is not out of the woods yet. The government, which gets about half of its revenues from hydrocarbon exports, has been forced to plan for oil to trade at between $40 and $60 per barrel over the next seven years.
At least $50 a barrel is needed to balance the state budget this year with no more than a 3 per cent deficit, the maximum that President Putin says can be tolerated.
Anton Siluanov, the finance minister, recently warned of "difficult times" ahead, predicting the oil price could fall as low as $30 a barrel at times as Opec pumps as much as it can in an attempt to squeeze other producers out of the market.
With military and social spending - especially on pensions - increasing, Russia could encounter real trouble. Meanwhile, Western sanctions after the annexation of Crimea in 2014 continue to trouble companies and banks attempting to refinance their foreign debt.
Moscow boasted that its countersanctions on US and European produce together with the depreciating rouble could be a boon for domestic producers, who would occupy a market emptied of foreign imports. It has yet to bear much fruit.
Despite its troubles, Russia still has international reserves of more than $360 billion, which the authorities have been at pains to preserve, preferring to allow the rouble to slide. Yet analysts say that without structural reforms to stifle corruption, reduce dependence on natural resources and boost investment Russia faces long-term decline.
Hugh Tomlinson Mumbai 2016 2015 India 7.5 5.5 4.8 63.9 GDP growth Inflation Unemployment Debt as % of GDP 7.3 5.4 4.8 65.3 Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister, below, has struggled to deliver on his promised economic reforms. Domestic politics and the mammoth task of overhauling a corrupt, byzantine bureaucracy have hampered the string of business initiatives.
But India has been the world's fastest growing major economy this year and looks set to remain so into 2016. Government figures released in mid-December showed growth accelerating through the third quarter to 7.4 per cent, driven by improved demand and manufacturing output.
Analysts remain cautious, pointing to weak corporate earnings and a steady decline in exports as evidence that economic activity remains fragile. A change in the method Delhi uses to assemble its economic data has prompted suggestions that growth is overvalued.
Mr Modi needs big investments to create jobs for a vast and rapidly-growing population but has been hobbled by his political opponents. His Bharatiya Janata party was trounced at November elections in Bihar, denting his hopes of securing a majority in both houses of parliament and pushing through his legislative agenda next year.
That has delayed one of the most sweeping reforms, a plan to simplify India's sprawling tax code, introducing a nationwide goods and services tax to replace the bewildering hash of state levies.
The government has eased foreign investment limits in several sectors to attract more overseas capital. India recorded $19.4 billion in foreign direct investment during the first half of 2015, up 30 per cent year-on-year.
The year closed with Mr Modi inking a deal that will see Japan build India's first bullet train, linking Mumbai and Ahmedabad. The scheme has infuriated his critics, who point out that the £9.8 billion cost is more than double the budget for the rest of India's dilapidated rail network next year. It is also three times planned spending on health and double the budget for schools.
Mr Modi's opponents argue that he is too focused on extravagant vanity projects. The government scrapped plans for a universal healthcare scheme this year, citing financial constraints. Backed by solid growth, however, his energetic diplomacy remains a key factor in promoting India as an attractive market for investment in 2016.
James Hider Brazil 2016 2015 Brazil -1 6.3 8.6 74.5 GDP growth Inflation Unemployment Debt as % of GDP -3 8.9 6.6 69.9 After a decade of boom, many of Latin America's largest economies are facing a rough ride this year as China's appetite for commodities fades and the crash in oil prices tips exposed economies into crisis.
The worst hit will be Venezuela, whose Socialist government used the oil boom to create massive subsidies, but did little to invest in domestic production, leaving the country heavily reliant on imports. The country gets almost all its foreign income from oil, having the largest proven reserves in the world. The latest crash has analysts predicting the economy will shrink by as much as 10 per cent this year - the worst performance in the world - with inflation estimated at around 200 per cent. The disastrous performance has already cost the government control of parliament in this month's elections, and some analysts warn the crisis could erupt into civil unrest.
Brazil is also set to feel the pain, with the economy expected to contract by almost 3 per cent, and another 1 per cent next year, and the real weakening dramatically. During the boom years of selling soy, oil and other commodities to China, Brazil built up welfare programmes that lifted millions out of poverty, but the Chinese downturn, low oil prices and a corruption scandal at the stateowned oil giant Petrobras rocked confidence in what seemed a powerhouse of Latin American growth. President Rousseff is also facing impeachment charges that stem, in part, from allegations of fiddling the country's accounts to make the economy appear healthier.
Analysts also predict a rocky ride for Argentina's incoming centre-right President Macri as he struggles with low federal reserves and 25 per cent inflation left by his predecessor Cristina Kirchner. He has promised to relax currency controls and scrap high export taxes on agricultural goods. That, combined with the huge potential of foreign investment, has led some to hope that he could overcome the rough start and reopen the country to the world.
Lucy Alexander Tokyo 2016 2015 Japan 1 0.4 3.5 247.8 GDP growth Inflation Unemployment Debt as % of GDP 0.6 0.7 3.5 245.9 On the microscopic scale of potential Japanese economic growth, the year looks like it will be relatively good, with most analysts predicting annual expansion of about 1 per cent. This is as much as can be expected for a greying economy whose population is now in freefall.
Japan is likely to end 2015 with annual growth of around 0.5 per cent, according to the OECD, after it narrowly avoided a technical recession in the third quarter. Spending has remained poor since a 3 percentage-point rise in sales tax in 2014, but analysts believe consumers may be more open as falling energy prices begin to offset high food bills, caused by an increase in the price of imported food due to the weak yen.
Unemployment is at 3.1 per cent, a 20-year low, and could fall more, which should cause wages to rise. Expect pressure on companies to raise salaries before a second rise in sales tax, from 8 to 10 per cent, hits in next year.
Japan has fallen into a microeconomic pattern as it repeatedly grows and shrinks by small amounts. GDP has fallen in seven out of 15 quarters since early 2012, and change seems unlikely, given the country's demographic disfunction.
The population fell by 0.2 per cent last year, a fall that will continue until the government finds a way to boost the birthrate or accepts large-scale immigration. Until then, Japan's economy must run to stand still, with a shrinking band of youngsters paying the ever-increasing pension bill for the nation's massed ranks of elderly baby-boomers, many of whom will live to more than 100.
Shinzo Abe, Japan's prime minister, announced in September the second phase of his stimulus drive, a plan to build "A Society in Which All 100 Million Citizens can Become Dynamically Engaged". Dubbed "Abenomics 2.0", this plan includes an unlikely pledge to increase the size of Japan's economy by more than a fifth to £3.4 trillion. The timeframe is unspecified.

Netanyahu wife questioned on ice cream claims.

Gregg Carlstrom.

Binyamin Netanyahu's wife was questioned by police yesterday about allegations that she claimed exorbitant expenses on alcohol, ice cream, make-up, hairdressers' bills and garden furniture. 
It is the first time that the spouse of an Israeli leader has been summoned for questioning and marks the latest part of a widening scandal over her behaviour at the prime minister's official residence in Jerusalem.
Sara Netanyahu spent several hours at the headquarters of the anti-fraud unit in the city of Lod but was allowed to take her official car into the police compound to avoid a media scrum. The police inquiry was triggered by a scathing report published in February on her expenses. It claimed that the first couple may have broken the law by hiring an electrician, Avi Fahima, to work on their home in the seaside resort of Caesarea. The electrician is a former member of the central committee of the ruling Likud party, led by Mr Netanyahu.
Detectives were expected to question Mrs Netanyahu about the refunds on empty bottles returned to supermarkets. She is alleged to have kept the 5p on each bottle. The drinks were state property, so keeping the refunds may have been a criminal act. The Netanyahus returned 4,000 shekels (£670) to the treasury after the claim was published in 2013.
Mrs Netanyahu is also expected to be questioned about garden furniture bought for the official residence. Police believe that the Netanyahus moved it to their private home.
Mr Netanyahu won a fourth term as prime minister in March despite years of personal scandals. The couple were said to have spent 166,000 shekels (£28,000) on hair and make-up in 2010 and 2011, more than twice the budgeted amount. There were claims of a £1,700 contract with an ice cream shop and a £16,900 alcohol bill over two years.
Much of the controversy has focused on Mrs Netanyahu, portrayed in the press as a modern Marie Antoinette.
Several former employees have sued her for abusive behaviour and testified in court that she flew into drunken rages, hurling plates and racial insults.
The Netanyahus have denied any wrongdoing and have accused journalists of exaggerating the scandals to unseat the prime minister. Mr Netanyahu commands a bare majority of 61 seats in the 120-member Knesset.

Carry on Cameron - for another four years; 
Times poll REJECTS rivals as PM predicts turnaround.

Sam Coates.

David Cameron insists today that Britain is in the middle of one of the "great reforming decades" as a poll by The Times reveals that voters want him to remain in Downing Street until 2020.
The survey comes as the prime minister sets out his long-term vision for transforming Britain, saying that he will seek to alleviate poverty, increase social mobility, tackle extremism and promote home ownership.
Mr Cameron's message will be seen as an attempt to calm fears among some Tory MPs that the coming year will be dominated by the looming European Union referendum and speculation over the Conservative leadership race. 
The prime minister said in March that he would not seek a third term, prompting concern among some supporters that he would end up as a lame-duck leader. He has repeatedly refused to set out a timetable for his departure, saying that he has a packed domestic agenda to complete.
A State of the Nation YouGov poll for The Times indicates today that 55 per cent of Tory voters want him to delay his departure until just before the 2020 election at the earliest.
Of those, 22 per cent want him to break his vow and seek to serve a third term. Only 15 per cent of Tory voters are urging him to leave office before 2019.
Among the wider electorate, 37 per cent of voters want Mr Cameron to remain as leader until the 2020 election. Eleven per cent want him to stay longer. Only 32 per cent want him to stand down before 2019.
In his message today, Mr Cameron highlights challenges that he wants to address, including the "scandal" that there are more young black men in prison than studying at Britain's top universities, which he says is caused by poor schooling, discrimination and, in some cases, the effects of extremism.
Mr Cameron will use a new-year article on the ConservativeHome website to say that he has not given up on the need for reform. "I genuinely believe we are in the middle of one of the great reforming decades in our history - what I would call a 'turnaround decade', where we can use the platform of our renewed economic strength to go for real social renewal. So here are the things I want to get done."
His approach echoes that taken by Tony Blair, who promised to leave after the 2005 election, but said later that he needed more time for domestic reforms.
The poll makes worrying reading for George Osborne. Among the public, Boris Johnson was the most popular choice to succeed Mr Cameron, backed by 25 per cent of those asked, followed by Theresa May, the home secretary, on 15 per cent. The chancellor was third on 13 per cent. The race is closer among Tory voters, however, with the London mayor on 31 per cent, Mr Osborne on 29 per cent, and Mrs May on 21 per cent.
The poll also found Jeremy Corbyn looking more secure as Labour leader, Continued on page 2, col 5 Continued from page 1 Tony Blair, who promised to leave after the 2005 election, but said later that he needed more time for domestic reforms.

The YouGov poll put the European referendum almost neck and neck, with 41 per cent of respondents wanting to remain and 42 per cent in favour of leaving. Expectations for the renegotiation remain low: only 9 per cent think significant change likely; most expect only a few tweaks. A clear majority of people expect Britain to end up voting to stay.

I'm a fool, says MP in sex texts scandal.

Sam Coates.

A Labour MP who exposed his predecessor, Sir Cyril Smith, as a paedophile is facing expulsion from his party after sending sexually explicit messages to a teenage girl.
Simon Danczuk, 49, was suspended from the Labour party yesterday after it emerged that he sent lewd texts to the 17-year-old student, who was hoping to get a job in his constituency office.
In one message, the MP for Rochdale allegedly joked with Sophena Houlihan about whether she wanted to be spanked by him. In another he wrote: "God I'm horny!" An inquiry has been launched by the disciplinary committee of the party's ruling National Executive Committee. Ken Livingstone, a committee member and key ally of Jeremy Corbyn, the party leader, said that the investigation could lead to Mr Danczuk's expulsion. 
Detectives from Greater Manchester police have already investigated whether the student, who lives with her mother, was being harassed and decided that no offence had been committed. Mr Danczuk, a high-profile oppo-nent of Mr Corbyn, and Miss Houlihan, now 18, exchanged messages for nearly a month before he asked how old she was, according to The Sun newspaper. She made contact in July on Facebook and said that messages from the MP quickly became explicit.
"When I got in touch, I never expected the messages to get so graphic. At the time I played along with it but now I feel like he duped me. I was keen for a career in politics and I was in awe of him," she told The Sun. The teenager admitted that she enjoyed the attention. "There is something about him that I was attracted to," she said.
Mr Danczuk asked about her age in August. When she replied that she was 17, he wrote: "Good for you." Several of the most explicit exchanges took place in September.
Mr Danczuk wrote on Twitter yesterday: "My behaviour was inappropriate and I apologise unreservedly to everyone I've let down. I was stupid and there's no fool like an old fool." He went on to say that while not every detail of the story was accurate, it "refers to an extremely low point in my life".
The MP's personal life has repeatedly made the headlines over the past year after the collapse of his marriage to Karen, who was dubbed the selfie queen after posting numerous photographs of herself. He said that his work to expose child sex abuse had left him depressed and contributed to the split. He revealed that he was receiving psychiatric treatment and would be stepping back from his campaigning.
Mr Danczuk embarked on a public relationship with Claire Hamilton, a Labour councillor, who tweeted after Christmas that she had "dumped" him.
Mr Livingstone told LBC radio that he was disturbed by the MP's behaviour. "I can't see what pleasure you get out of this," he said. "For me you want a relationship with someone who is an equal, not with someone in their mid-teens. I don't see how you could be sexually attracted to somebody that young." He went on to suggest that Mr Danczuk craved publicity. "I've not so much tended to look at Simon as a Labour MP but as just a character. He's always seemed to me to be absolutely obsessed with keeping himself in the headlines."
Mr Corbyn said that the decision over Mr Danczuk's future rested with the NEC.
