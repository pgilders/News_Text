Here in the UK, the energy regulator has accused the big six energy firms of overcharging customers. They haven't cut their retail prices despite plunging wholesale prices on international markets. 
                       The Guardian's energy editor Terry Macalister writes:                     
The big six energy companies including SSE, npower and E.ON have made no recent announcements about cutting retail prices although British Gas did reduce its tariff by 5% last August.
"I think they are overcharging in many cases," the head of Ofgem Dermot Nolan told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. There should be bigger cuts in retail energy bills, he added.

This list of the EU's main trading partners published by Eurostat shows the rising importance of the US, while there is less trade with Russia (unsurprisingly). Exports to the US grew 20% in the first 11 months of last year versus the same period in 2014, while sales to Russia slumped 29%.

On a lighter note, with global stock markets sliding and savings rates at record lows, the best investment at the moment could be a handbag. My colleague Sean Farrell writes :
Not just any handbag, though. The accessory in question is the Hermes Birkin, the world's most coveted bag, which can cost up to £150,000 new.
In the 35 years since the actor and singer Jane Birkin sat next to Hermes' boss Jean-Louis Dumas on a plane and complained about not being able to find a good leather weekend bag, the Birkin bag has beaten returns for gold and the benchmark US S&P 500 index, according to the luxury bag retail site Baghunter.

 Brent crude at a 12-year low  
Back to oil, which is still below $30 a barrel. It hit $29.73 at one stage, the lowest since February 2004, and is now trading at $29.89 a barrel. 
The International Atomic Energy Agency could issue its report on Iran's compliance with an agreement to rein in its nuclear programme during a meeting in Vienna on Friday, whereupon western sanctions could be lifted and open the door to more oil supply from Iran. The country's oil exports are already on track to hit a nine-month high in January, at 1.1m barrels a day.
Analysts at Commerzbank said:
With sanctions on Iran likely to be lifted, more oil is flooding the markets. Although the additional supply had been imminent for some time, current sentiment ought to send prices further south."
They cut their 2016 forecast for oil prices to $50 per barrel for Brent by the end of the year, down from a previous forecast of $63.

 Sterling hits 5 1/2 year low against dollar  
Sterling has hit a 5 1/2 year low against the dollar again, as traders are growing doubtful over Britain's economic outlook and the timing of the first rate hike - which some don't expect until early next year - and fears over "Brexit" intensify.
Prime minister David Cameron has promised a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU by the end of 2017, but it may come as early as June this year. Volatility in markets is likely to increase in the run-up to the poll.
The pound slipped 0.5% to $1.4337 earlier, its weakest level since May 2016. It has lost more than 6% in the past six months. It also lost ground against the euro. The euro rose 0.7% to 75p, not far off a one-year high of 76.06p it hit on Thursday.

 The Bank of England said that British banks saw a notable rise in demand for personal loans and other unsecured credit in late 2015, and this is expected to continue into this year. 
The Bank's credit conditions survey said banks were awarding more unsecured lending to households as their appetite for risk grew.
The increase in unsecured credit availability appeared particularly apparent in other unsecured lending, such as personal loans, where credit scoring criteria were reported to have loosened."

 Greece's European lenders likely to start reform review next week  
Greece's European lenders are expected to start a review of Athens' reform programme next week, although talks on debt relief may still be several months away.
Before those talks start, Greece needs to conclude a first review of reforms agreed last summer under its third bailout programme with its lenders, which include the EU executive and the International Monetary Fund.
European Commission vice president Valdis Dombrovskis said in an interview with Greek daily Kathimerini:
We are ready to the start the review as soon as possible, most likely next week. But we are not setting any time limit for when the review should be concluded."
Dombrovskis said that to secure a positive progress review, Greece needs to implement pension reform, set up a new privatisation fund and find ways of achieving primary budget surpluses for 2016 to 2018.
He said:
If Greece concludes the review, it will show it is serious with its promises, its programme is on track and this would be a very positive step so that stability is restored."
Greece and some eurozone officials have said the review could be finished next month, but Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the chairman of eurozone finance ministers, cautioned on Thursday that it could be months rather than weeks.
Greece's finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos believes an agreement could be reached within four weeks. He has been touring eurozone capitals to explain the reforms and drum up support for an early conclusion to the review.
Dombrovskis said the European Commission is assuming that the IMF will once again be part of the bailout. The Washington-based fund provided financing for Greece's first two bailouts in 2010 and 2012. But IMF chief Christine Lagarde has said that the fund will probably only decide in the spring whether to take part in the third bailout.
She told Germany's S¸ddeutsche Zeitung that the issues of debt sustainability and progress on pension reforms will be key.
It is clear that pension reform is the trigger that will prove that Greece's economic position is improving."
The IMF has not provided any aid to Athens since August 2014 under a previous programme that is due to expire next March.

Nick Bubb says about BonmarchÈ,  which already lowered its profit estimates in mid-December and stuck to that guidance today:
Back on Dec 16 th, poor old BonmarchÈ was one of the first fashion retailers to warn that trading conditions during November and early December had been very challenging and since then that story has been well played out. 
 Interestingly, however, Beth Butterwick, (the soon-to-be-departed CEO), says: " In the short period since Christmas, demand has trended towards more normal levels " (which bears out the message from the recent John Lewis sales figures."
The latest John Lewis figures out this morning were strong, showing sales rising 15.6% last week year-on-year (against a sluggish week a year ago), driven by electrical goods (up 18.8%) and fashion (15.4%). Online sales were also strong, rising nearly 26%.

 Corporate round-up  
After Thursday's flurry of retail news, Friday is much quieter. Here's a round-up of the main corporate news.
 The competition regulator has given the final clearance for BT's contentious £12.5bn takeover of EE, Britain's largest mobile phone network, reports Sean Farrell.  You can read more here.
The Competition and Markets Authority said it did not expect the takeover to lead to a substantial reduction in competition or detriment to consumers in any market in the UK, including mobile and broadband services.
It said there was little overlap between BT's mainly fixed phone, broadband and pay-TV business and EE's mobile phone operation. The merger was also unlikely to make things worse for other operators using BT's network.
 UK housebuilder Bovis Homes is leading gains on the FTSE 250 index, rising 3.4% to 953p, after posting record profits for 2015. The company delivered 3,934 homes last year, which represents an increase of over 8% from 2014. The average selling price rose 7% to £231,000. Like its peers, Bovis is confident about the housing market, which is underpinned by government-backed initiatives such as help to buy.
 H&M said it had a good December, with sales up 10% year-on-year. In November, mild weather in north America and Europe put customers off buying winter clothing at the Swedish retailer and sales rose only 4%.
 BonmarchÈ, the UK bargain fashion retailer who targets women over 50, fared less well. Like-for-like sales were down 1.3% in the quarter to 26 December.

Simon Smith, chief economist at broker FxPro, says 2016 so far has been a "terrible year for global stock markets".
According to unofficial theory a 20% decline in a stock index means that it has entered an official bear market and we saw this from the Shanghai Composite overnight following another 3.5% loss. The end of the week in Asia has seen emerging markets record their third weekly loss in a row and the same can be said for some European markets. 
This is now starting to be reflected in profit forecasts for S&P companies across the pond where we're seeing the most downgrades to earnings compared to upgrades since 2009. Crude prices are also lower overnight but for all the talk about whether oil will fall to $20 or whether it won't we have to remember that commodities entered their massive bear market by the 20% measure as far back as 2014."

This means that the Shanghai Composite index, which recorded its lowest close since December 2014, is now in a bear market. It has lost more than 20% from its recent high on 22 December. A bear market is defined as a drop of 20% or more from a recent high.
The tech-focused Shenzhen Composite, which finished 3.4% lower at 1,796.1, already entered a bear market a week ago, and is now down 24.5% from its recent 22 December high.

 VW market share in Europe falls for first time since 2007  
European car sales figures are out. They show that Volkswagen's market share in Europe fell last year for the first time since 2007 as the emissions rigging scandal took its toll.
VW accounted for 24.8% of new cars sold in Europe compared with 25.5% in 2014, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association in Brussels.
The industry as a whole had a good year, with sales jumping 9.2% to a six-year high of 14.2m vehicles, compared with VW's 6.2% increase.
Europe's biggest carmaker has lost ground to rivals such as Fiat Chrysler, BMW and Daimler since the scandal broke in mid-September and put consumers off buying its cars. Bloomberg has all the details.

 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. 
Brent crude is continuing its slide, trading down 1.85% at $30.31 a barrel at the minute. New York Light crude is down even more, losing 3% to $30.27 a barrel. 
The market is bracing itself for more supply from Iran. Western sanctions on the country are expected to be lifted within days, after a historic nuclear deal with Tehran was reached last summer.
Brent is heading for a weekly loss of about 10%. Mining giant BHP Billiton has been forced to write down the value of its onshore American oil and gas assets by more than 30% in the wake of the slump in crude oil prices.
Fresh pressure on oil prices and poor Chinese lending data pushed Asian stocks to 3 1/2 year lows on Friday. 
New lending by Chinese banks was weaker than expected in December and well down on the previous month. Banks extended 597.8bn yuan ($90.76bn) of new loans in the final month of 2015, fuelling concerns that Beijing's efforts to boost borrowing via monetary easing are not transmitting to the real economy.
Li Huiyong, an economist at Shenyin & Wanguo Securities in Shanghai, said:
The fall in new yuan loans showed there was little demand for investment and reflected sluggish economic performance in the real economy."

Sebastian Coe runs into national newspaper scepticism; 
Press turns on the IAAF president after report that damns his organisation.

Roy Greenslade.

Sebastian Coe came in for a drubbing across the national press on Friday following the independent commission report into corruption at the International Association of Athletics Federation (IAAF).
Newspaper commentators and leader writers were anything but sympathetic towards Coe following his admission that he is presiding over a "failed organisation" because of the way it handled corruption and doping cover-ups.
There was a measure of incredulity that the investigator, Dick Pound, should suggest that the "best person" to clean up the IAAF was Coe, its new president.
Although Pound said Coe "would have done something" about the corruption had he known about it, that view was met with considerable scepticism, exemplified by the Times's headline: " Coe backed by Pound but damned by his inquiry." 
The Independent was so unimpressed that its editorial demanded that Coe stand down. "It is still just about possible that Sebastian Coe was the only clean man in the IAAF stable," it began. But it regarded this as "a generous interpretation" that was "contradicted by the key line from Mr Pound's own report": 
 "'The IAAF council could not have been unaware of doping and the non-enforcement of applicable anti-doping rules.' Lord Coe, of course, was on that council." 
The paper accused Coe of being "slow on the uptake", pointing out that he had praised his predecessor, Lamine Diack, who was strongly criticised in Pound's report. 
"Two days ago," said the Indy, Coe "maintained that there had been 'no cover-up', a conclusion directly contradicted yesterday by Mr Pound." It continued:
 "Lord Coe must have been aware of doping and conspiracy within the IAAF, but did not seek to find out more; he trusted colleagues who have since been exposed as corrupt; he objected to reporters asking questions; he lavished praise on Mr Diack in a valedictory speech. It amounts, in the kindest of eyes, to the record of an insider content to look the other way rather than risk his accession to a plum job." 
It concluded: "Even if Lord Coe is as clean as Mr Pound believes, he is startlingly naive, or bafflingly incurious. That is the exact opposite of what any reformer should be. He must go."
                     The Times's editorial contended that Coe's "credibility and his ability to clean house as he has promised are now open to question. He has a mountain to climb."
It said that after "decades of brazen doping and feeble anti-doping enforcement" Coe's position is "uncomfortable" and "too often he has given the impression of being in denial about the extent of doping in athletics and of corruption in its governing body."
But the paper said that is "no doubt that world athletics is better off under Lord Coe than under Mr Diack." Now it falls to him "to enforce a transparent process that ensures no team can compete on the world stage unless demonstrably drug-free. That is a colossal task given athletics' dismal doping record." 
The Times concluded that Coe "will have to act fearlessly to convince a sceptical public that he is the right man for the job."
And that scepticism was most evident in the comments of sports journalists. As the Daily Mail's Martin Samuel remarked : "If anything encapsulates the existential crisis that is engulfing athletics right now it is this: Lord Coe is still seen as the best man for the job."
And he followed up this blunt appraisal by heaping opprobrium on the IAAF president:
 "If Diack is now considered to be a crook on a colossal scale, Coe is at best his slow-witted dupe. As Diack concocted an extortion racket with the aid of family members and tawdry accomplices, Coe failed to show the necessary interest in their activities... Yet still he sails on." 
Samuel, after pointing out that Coe has been was elected on the IAAF board since 2007, asked: "What has he been doing in that time? What questions has he asking? Who has he been seeing?" He continued:
 "The irony is that Lord Coe has lived his life, post-competition, in the corridors of the powerful. Governments, the Olympic movement, FIFA, the IAAF, Coe breaks bread with them all.  He is regarded as a man who gets jobs done, a politician, a mover and shaker. And yet what did he know about arguably the greatest sporting scandal of the modern age? Nothing." 
The Daily Mirror's Dave Kidd was also scathing about Coe's lack of knowledge about the "culture of corruption" at the IAAF:
 "He just didn't know about it. Even though Pound says he couldn't have not known. And yet Pound claims Coe, despite having been vice president to Lamine Diack... for seven years, is the ideal man to lead the organisation forward...Pound is surely operating on a gut feeling here... It is impossible to know whether Coe was complicit, naive or incompetent. But it is difficult to imagine he wasn't at least one of those three things." 
Vikki Orvice, writing in the Sun, thought Coe had been "let off the hook" because Pound's report stated that "IAAF councillors MUST have been aware of the extent of doping in the sport." Even so, Pound considered Coe to be "the best man to lead the crisis-hit organisation."
Brendan Foster, in the Mail, was more understanding towards the man he once shared a room with during their days as runners.
Coe "is really hurting", he wrote. In Prague in 1978, "he was robbed of a medal by a drugs cheat, so no-one should underestimate how personally affected he is by this." 
But Foster accepted that Coe "has made mistakes, such as calling his predecessor Lamine Diack a 'spiritual leader' of the sport", but asked: "Why would he have been so complimentary about Diack if he knew what was going on?"
He called on Coe to "demonstrate strong leadership" adding: "His demeanour reminds me of those days at the Moscow Olympics between the final of 800 metres, where he was beaten by Steve Ovett, and the 1500m where he bounced back to win... 
 "I'm seeing the same determination from him. Only it is going to be a few horrible years rather than days this time. First he needs to get rid of the poisoned name of the IAAF and change it to something like the World Athletics Federation.  The next thing is to move out of their Monaco headquarters. The only reason they are there is to save on tax but it appears secretive and they need to restore public confidence. I also think the old set of world records needs to be parked and a new set begun as of next year. Nobody believes the ones that are here now and how do you decide which ones to keep and which ones to throw out? It doesn't mean that the old set would be wiped, just that it runs parallel with the new set." 
But Foster was a rare voice in favour of Coe. Ian Herbert, in the Independent, summed up the majority view. "It is astonishing that Coe... did not, at the very least, hear the whispers too, and harbour faint suspicions that there was something malign at the heart of the IAAF."
He wrote: "Pound might have papered over the cracks of Coe's credibility but many others will not be so convinced. The Coe who leapt to his feet after the press conference, to be pursued through a hotel by journalists before disappearing through a side door, will only attain the credibility required to clean up athletics if the wider world can be satisfied that he has the rigour to reach beyond the grey cronyism and own up to the failings."

Overhauling political donation laws: what a great new election year's resolution; 
Combining stricter disclosure rules for donations and ending political ads dressed up as government information could enhance voters' faith in the system.

Lenore Taylor.

As this election year gets under way, we'll go through an annual ritual that is supposed to enhance our faith in the political system. Except everyone knows it's a sham.
Sure, there's lots of useful information in the February disclosure of donations to political parties from the Australian Electoral Commission.
 Related:  Australian major political parties reveal nearly $85,000 in undeclared donations
But we also know it's very easy for a donor to retain anonymity. Parties and donors only need to declare donations over $13,000. By donating just under that amount to each state and territory branch a donor could give more than $100,000 and remain in the shadows.  
And anyway the companies, unions and individuals whose generosity is reported all insist they are motivated by an altruistic desire to help the functioning of our democracy, and in no way by an expectation that they are buying influence or access to decision makers. 
That may be true. Except we keep getting examples where it isn't. Like the 2008 Wollongong council scandal in which donations were made in return for favourable development decisions. That led to a New South Wales ban on donations from property developers in 2009. But six years later the Independent Commission Against Corruption heard evidence that NSW Liberal figures circumvented the state ban by "washing" money through the federally controlled Free Enterprise Foundation.
The NSW premier, Mike Baird, has written to his federal colleagues asking that they work on a national system similar to the NSW laws, which include a $1,000 threshold for donations to be disclosed and caps on total allowable donations. National laws would mean the state laws could no longer be circumvented. That led to... well, so far that's led to absolutely nothing. Baird raised it at the dinner before the last Council of Australian Governments meeting in December, but he didn't get far.
Perhaps it's just a coincidence that last year's federal financial disclosures showed property developers and investors among the biggest donors to the major parties. 
The truth is every political party knows the system has to change. The cost of election campaigns has increased beyond their capacity to pay. They are forced to effectively beg for funds and that leaves them potentially dangerously beholden to corporate interests and, in the case of the Labor party, to the union movement. But the fear that any change might advantage an opponent - and the risk of a public backlash against higher rates of public funding, which is the only possible funding source - has stymied reform for decades.
Electors are left wondering if decisions have been made on their merits
  John Faulkner    
A former Liberal party president and treasurer, Shane Stone, recommended in 2007 that all corporate, trade union and third party donations be banned. 
And Labor's elder statesman John Faulkner warned for years that the cost of electioneering had created a campaigning "arms race", "heightening the danger that fundraising pressures on political parties and candidates will open the door to donations that might attempt to buy access and influence".
He said the current system was pernicious even if the donors weren't actually demanding political favours.
"The perception of undue influence can be as damaging to democracy as undue influence itself," he said in his Light on the Hill lecture in 2014.
"It undermines confidence in our processes of government, making it difficult to untangle the motivation behind policy decisions. Electors are left wondering if decisions have been made on their merits."
There have been numerous parliamentary reviews, the latest set up in October at the urging of independent senator John Madigan. Its first act was to write to the government asking why there had been no response to the last inquiry, which was finalised in 2011.
The major parties came incredibly close to an agreement in the last parliament to increase public funding by $1 a vote (it is $2.62 for all parties or candidates that get more than 4% of the vote) and to reduce thresholds for declaring donations back down to $5,000. Tony Abbott had even signed the deal but after a backlash from his party room he reneged and it all fell apart.
Labor still supports a reduction in the disclosure threshold to $1,000, with caps on donations and campaign spending, extra public funding and nationally consistent laws.
The Greens have long championed change. Baird has the backing of other premiers.
And in the current parliament both major party leaders have something to gain from breaking the decades-long deadlock and actually agreeing on change. 
Malcolm Turnbull championed donations reform when he was first elected, remarkably similar to that suggested by Labor and Baird.
"No political donations should be allowed unless they are: from citizens and/or persons on the electoral roll (ie no companies, unions, associations etc); subject to a cap; and donors should certify that the donation is either their own or their spouse's money and has not been given to them by a third party," he wrote at the time.
And he sought the Liberal leadership in 2015 by pledging to restore voters' trust and confidence in the political process. This would be a very good way to do it.
Bill Shorten is battling the evidence to the royal commission about the influence of unions over his party. But the truth is Labor is deeply dependent on union donations. Implementing party policy for a cap and tougher disclosure rules could work for Shorten too.
Opponents often argue that cracking down on donations disclosure would just mean the rise of single issue or legislation-specific spending, like the "pacs" that operate in the US.
But that wouldn't be all that different from the campaigns the mining industry or the union movement or various other business groups have run already. And at least things would be in the open - the interest groups would be clearly spending their money in support of a particular policy outcome and putting their names to their arguments.
I've even got an idea for where the cash for the extra public funding could come from.
After the 2013 election political parties and candidates were eligible for a total of $58m - it was then $2.48 a vote. Adding $1 a vote wouldn't cost much more than the advertising campaigns governments run in election years which are really political but are dressed up as government advertising to qualify for taxpayer funding.
 Related:  Revealed: political parties' widespread failure to disclose donations
The Turnbull government is conducting "research" before an $18m advertising campaign about infrastructure. It's unclear exactly what they will advertise. Turnbull overturned Abbott's roads-only obsession and said he would also give money to public transport. And some of the old prime minister's pledges haven't really weathered the test of time. The $1.5bn for the now-abandoned Melbourne East West link, for example, was found by the audit office to have been handed over despite warnings that it had not been properly assessed and was not yet even needed.
The Turnbull government is also planning to spend $28m advertising innovation. In late 2014 the Abbott government spent almost $10m advertising higher education changes that were never legislated, in the hope that they might be. And this is not a new racket. Both sides have done it forever.
                     The official guidelines  say advertising "must not be conducted for party political purposes" but also that "governments may legitimately use public funds to... encourage informed consideration of issues or to change behaviour".
If they were tightened so only the explanation of new legislation or a new program qualified as official government advertising, the millions being spent on back-door political advertising could be used to increase public funding to the parties. They would probably use it for actual political advertising, which would be more effective for them anyway.
And a combination of stricter disclosure rules for donations and an end to political ads dressed up as government information might actually enhance voters' faith in the system.

Bidding process for 2020 Tokyo Olympics dragged into IAAF scandal; 
∑ Wada investigation reveals money may have influenced Lamine Diack's vote ∑ Diack switched support from Istanbul to Tokyo after sponsorship payment.

Owen Gibson.

The bidding process for the 2020 Olympics has been dragged into the IAAF scandal after Dick Pound's Wada investigation revealed that $5m of sponsorship money may have been a factor in swaying Lamine Diack's vote. 
 Related:  Inside the IAAF: who knew what and when
Pound's independent commission examined transcripts that showed Diack dropped his support for Istanbul and switched to Tokyo after the Japanese city agreed to pay the sponsorship cash.
The commission also uncovered evidence that senior IAAF officials benefited personally from the decisions to award athletics' world championships.
The commission's report cites transcripts of conversations between Diack's son Khalil and Turkish officials in relation to the 2020 Olympics.
It states: "Transcripts of the various discussions between Turkish individuals with KD [Khalil Diack] make reference to a discussion regarding the Olympic city bidding process for the 2020 Summer Olympic Games.
"It is stated that Turkey lost LD's [Lamine Diack's] support because they did not pay sponsorship moneys of $4m-$5m either to the Diamond League or IAAF. According to the transcript the Japanese did pay such a sum.
" The 2020 Games were awarded to Tokyo. The IC did not investigate this matter further for it was not within our remit."
It is believed the sponsorship deal in question involved the Japanese electronics giant Canon, which was a Tokyo 2020 gold partner and signed a multi-year deal with the IAAF 10 months out from the Olympics vote in Buenos Aires.
In a prepared statement, Tokyo 2020 spokeswoman Hikariko Ono said: "The note in the report is beyond our understanding."
"The Games were awarded to Tokyo because the city presented the best bid. Tokyo's bid was about Japan's commitment to address issues around the integrity of sport."

 VW market share in Europe falls for first time since 2007  
European car sales figures are out. They show that Volkswagen's market share in Europe fell last year for the first time since 2007 as the emissions rigging scandal took its toll.
VW accounted for 24.8% of new cars sold in Europe compared with 25.5% in 2014, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association in Brussels.
The industry as a whole had a good year, with sales jumping 9.2% to a six-year high of 14.2m vehicles, compared with VW's 6.2% increase.
Europe's biggest carmaker has lost ground to rivals such as Fiat Chrysler, BMW and Daimler since the scandal broke in mid-September and put consumers off buying its cars. Bloomberg has all the details.

Is it corruption for a politician to take a bribe if he doesn't follow through?; 
The US supreme court will decide whether disgraced Virginia governor Bob McDonnell's inaction after accepting extravagant gifts invalidates his conviction.

Scott Lemieux.

Post- Citizens United, the political world is awash in cash and distinguishing between scandalous-but-legal and illegally scandalous attempts by the wealthy to influence public officials is becoming increasingly difficult. On Friday, the US supreme court agreed to hear a case in which a former elected official, convicted of taking extravagant gifts to influence policy, now argues that because he failed to deliver on his promises to the person trying to corrupt him, he isn't guilty of corruption.
The case in question is that of former Republican Virginia governor Bob McDonnell who in 2014 was convicted of 11 charges related to federal anti-corruption statutes. (His wife Maureen McDonnell was convicted of 8 in the same case). I don't have a great deal of sympathy for McDonnell, who accepted large amounts of money from someone clearly seeking political influence while also enacting repugnant policies. But he has a decent chance of winning - and, should he prove successful, it's fair to say that Americans concerned with the corrupting influence of money in politics should be even more concerned. 
The McDonnells' story started in a place many Americans will be familiar with: crushing debt. When he took office in 2010, McDonnell and his wife had accumulated $90,000 in credit card debt and owed another $2.5m in bank loans. A partial solution to their problems came in the form of a guardian angel named Jonnie Williams, who wanted various forms of government support for his attempts to market a supplement called Anatabloc. He became a political contributor to McDonnell, but also a major personal benefactor to the governor and his wife.
Starting with a dinner that included a $5,000 bottle of cognac and promises of an inaugural gown designed personally by Oscar de la Renta, Williams began to ply the McDonnells with an array of lavish gifts. According to Williams, at one point he agreed to loan Maureen McDonnell $65,000 to apply to debts and expenses for her daughter's wedding, in exchange for the governor's help with his nutritional supplement business. Later that month, Williams covered a more than $2,000 golf club tab for the governor, his sons and future son-in-law - one of many large gifts he would continue to bestow on the entire McDonnell family. Eventually, the value of Williams' gifts added up to nearly $180,000.
Had McDonnell took direct action on behalf of Williams, there would be no serious question that he violated corruption statutes. What made the case tricky,  as Slate's Dahlia Lithwick put it, is that it was "never perfectly clear that the prosecutors found the quid to the pro quo." 
The prosecution presented convincing evidence that Maureen McDonnell had made promises to Williams in exchange for money, but less evidence that her husband had followed though on those promises. The prosecution argued that the McDonnells colluded to take the money from Williams in exchange for favors; McDonnell's defense was that the governor did not collude with his wife, with whom he alleged he was estranged. The jury bought the prosecution's version of events. 
Admittedly, as a jaded resident of New York's beautiful state capital, Albany, this scandal seems rather penny-ante. Where are the multi-million dollar kickback schemes ? Where are the no-work jobs for idiot sons ? 
Still, the fact that McDonnell is not quite in Sheldon Silver or Dean Skelos's class as a political criminal doesn't mean that his behavior wasn't illegal. A jury thought so, and the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld his conviction unanimously. But the US supreme court has agreed to consider three related issues in his case, all of which have ramifications that could affect future political corruption prosecutions.
The first argument McDonnell's attorneys will be making is that the actions for which he was convicted were not actually covered by the laws under which he was convicted: the honest services fraud ban and the Hobbs Act. McDonnell's argument is that these laws cover only "exercising actual governmental power, threatening to exercise such power, or pressuring others to exercise such power" but, because the jury was not so instructed, his convictions should be thrown out. Given the facts of the case - that McDonnell didn't even try to do anything that Williams wanted him to do - it would have been difficult to convict McDonnell under that definition of the statute.
But, if the court declines to define the laws more narrowly, McDonnell's argument is that the laws themselves should be ruled unconstitutional. 
The line of reasoning most likely to win would be that defining the statute as broadly as it was - that essentially convicting him of taking bribes he had no intention of honoring with action - makes the law itself unconstitutionally vague. And, convicting someone of a crime if the statute does not make clear which activities will be illegal does violate the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. 
That argument may well get him somewhere with the justices: in 2010, the disgraced Enron executive Jeffrey Skilling had his sentence reduced because  the US supreme court unanimously concluded that the honest services statute was unconstitutionally vague as applied to any conduct except participating in bribery and kickback schemes. The court may well conclude that applying federal fraud statutes to cases where the "quid" is not met with a clear "pro quo" is unconstitutional - that taking gifts which the giver intends as an inducement to political action when the recipient has no intention of following through isn't actually corruption.
A final approach for McDonnell could be to argue that the Hobbs Act is unconstitutional on federalism grounds or that, since the gift-giver was only intending to influence state policy, any actual crime would be a matter for the states to prosecute and not the federal government. Some conservatives have previously argued that the Hobbs Act exceeded the power of the federal government under the commerce clause, and,  in a 1999 case, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals split 8-8 on the question. 
McDonnell may not pursue the last argument with any vigor or attract attention from the court with it, since the liberal justices on the court are unlikely to side with him on it - though don't rule out the possibility that the Roberts Court would use McDonnell's case as a vehicle to put further limits on federal power.
Still, if McDonnell wins, the US supreme court will essentially have ruled that politicians can accept unlimited gifts - in the McDonnells' case, they took cash, lavish outings, rides on his personal jet and all kinds of luxury goods - from donors and other people who seek to influence policy and, as long as they don't follow through on changing policy, it's perfectly legal to take the gifts. 
Most Americans would define that as corrupt; the US supreme court, which has already allowed the wealthy to spend unlimited money to elect the politicians of their choosing without the barest of disclosures, may decide that it's just business as usual.

 Dugher says adopting unilateral disarmament will lead to 'electoral disaster'  
 Michael Dugher, the former shadow culture secretary, has now delivered his full speech to Labour First, a group on the party's right. As well as saying that the May elections would be a decisive test for Jeremy Corbyn (see 10.31am), he also launched a very strong attack on Corbyn's position on Trident. Here are the key points.

Dugher said that adopting unilateral disarmament as party policy would lead to "electoral disaster".
There are real dangers here for Labour. For nearly three decades Labour has been committed to multilateral disarmament. We tried unilateralism before. It ended in electoral disaster then. There is no evidence to suggest that it won't end in disaster again. And running online plebiscites of a selection of party activists won't change these facts of political life.

He said Corbyn should be "taking the fight to the Tories", not finding an internal policy battle over Trident.
We should be taking the fight to the Tories and not picking another fight with ourselves. The decision to open up a divisive debate within the party about the renewal of trident is such an unnecessary distraction... How many days are we planning to waste having a self-indulgent debate about Trident?...
I also say this to Jeremy and the party leadership: if you really want to change our policies, pick the issues that matter to people outside the meeting halls, not just to those inside. Pick the issues where we can unite and where we can get back in touch with the public - let's not split the party and drive yet another wedge between the party and the country.

He said Corbyn could not use the party membership to bypass the Labour policy making process over Trident. He was referring to Corbyn's plan to ballot the membership over Trident. He said:
Labour party policy is very, very clear: we are in favour multi-lateral disarmament and the renewal of Trident. We make policy in the party through our democratic structures - not by diktats from the centre. You cannot shortcut the Party's democratic structures - to do so is to perform a grave disservice to our members.

 Deborah Mattinson's speech  
At the conference we're now in the panel session with Owen Jones, Deborah Mattinson, Tom Baldwin and Stella Creasy.
Mattinson, the Britain Thinks pollster who used to do polling for Labour, has just finished her speech. And it was very bleak for the audience. (She got a round of applause at the end, but said she had expected to get booed.) Here are the main points.

Mattinson said the most important job for an opposition was to be seen as a likely election winner.

She said the polls were probably still overstating Labour's support. In reality, the party was probably doing worse than the polls say.

She said a party could not win if it was behind on the issue of who is most trusted on the economy.

She said the popularity of the leader was a better guide to which party would win an election than state-of-the-party polls. And she cited this chart from the blogger Mike Smithson.

She said that when she conducted focus groups after the election, she found that people did not think Labour would deliver for them.

 Corbyn's speech - Snap verdict  
 Corbyn's speech - Snap verdict: A bit rambling, I thought, and devoid of rhetorical flourishes (not that that particularly matters), but it was very warmly received. In story terms, Corbyn did not have anything new to say beyond what his office briefed overnight. But the speech was a reminder of just how substantial the Corbyn agenda is, at least potentially. Rail nationalisation, breaking up the energy market with a focus on German-style community provision, a "lifelong education service", an extension of childcare, an extension of workers' rights, a big housebuilding programme - these proposals were all floated by Corbyn during his leadership campaign  (the policy documents are still on his website) but they have been overlooked, partly because for some of that campaign Corbyn was not seen as a serious contender. Corbyn still sounds quite tentative about many of his ideas - he kept stressing that they were suggestions, not adopted policy - but they do have genuine transformative potential, and this speech underlined that.

Corbyn says his plans to give members a greater role in policy making are similar to Ed Miliband's decision to let more people get involved in selecting the leader.
Ed Miliband expanded the vote to elect the Leader - empowering members and supporters ... I want to do the same with our policy-making ... We all have ideas, we all have a vision for a fairer Britain and a fairer world ... 
Labour will be stronger and more in touch with our communities when it hears from its greatest strength ... our members, supporters and affiliates.
And he ends saying only Labour can offer a fairer Britain.
Only Labour can offer a vision of a fairer Britain ... Let's work together to create and deliver that fairer Britain.

 Corbyn calls for more energy suppliers to be locally owned  
Corbyn turns to policy. He stresses that these ideas are "under discussion".
He starts with the railways.
We are committed to a publicly owned railway, to bring down fares and to get investment in a modern railway - which would be governed not remotely from Whitehall, but by passengers, rail workers and politicians (local and national).
And he turns to energy.
To democratic control of energy, not as an end in itself, but to bring down costs and to transition to carbon-free energy ... Do you know half of German energy suppliers are owned by local authorities, communities and small businesses ... There are now over 180 German towns and cities taking over their local electricity grids, selling themselves cleaner (and cheaper) electricity they increasingly produce for themselves ... That is something we as Labour should want to emulate - and the most innovative Labour councils are starting to do so.

Corbyn turns to Europe.
Labour backs Britain's continued EU membership as the best framework for trade and co-operation in the 21st-century ... along with the protection of human rights through the European Convention.
But we need to make EU decision-making more accountable to its people ... put jobs and growth at the heart of European policy ... strengthen workers' rights in a real social Europe, and end the pressure to privatise services.
block-time published-time 10.51am GMT 
Corbyn criticises the Tories for abandoning the steel industry.
Their laissez-faire attitude to the steel industry could let a downturn become a death spiral in that sector ... While other governments across Europe acted to protect their industry, the Tories let ours close, let jobs go, let communities suffer.
In Europe other countries have rejected this approach, he says.
Look across Europe and the support was there - in some cases they took their plants into public ownership to protect vital industry ... they offered schemes to help with energy costs ... and they have an industrial strategy and procurement strategies ... They don't let whole regions sink into decline.

Corbyn is now recalling his visits to people affected by the recent floods.
Hidden among the fake concern for 'balancing the books', is the same hoary old Tory ideology - to shrink the state, to shrink fairness. 
Look at the floods - flood defence schemes up and down the country cut back because of a political ideology that says the state must be shrunk. 
I saw the consequences of that. I met the families who had lost their personal possessions: their photos, children's toys, family pets - in homes that now have the foul stench of sewage-polluted floodwater. 
block-time published-time 10.48am GMT 
Corbyn says the Tories have a different notion of fairness.
Theirs is the party funded by hedge funds ... backed by a press owned by multi-millionaire or even billionaire tax avoiders ... 
Their concept of fairness is of a very different order to ours ... Fairness for only a few is not fairness, but privilege. 
block-time published-time 10.47am GMT 
Corbyn goes on to criticise other Tory moves that will constrain Labour.
 By directly attacking Labour's funding through their trade union bill ... and by cutting public Short money support for opposition parties' research, they are deliberately setting out to constrain democratic accountability.
Add to that their "gagging law", which prevents charities, unions and thinktanks from taking part in political debate near election time ... 
Their threats to use the BBC's charter renewal to hack away at its independence; 
Their packing of the House of Lords with Tory peers; 
Their moves to restrict the powers of local councils ... 
... It all adds up to a serious attack on democratic rights and freedoms.

 Corbyn accuses Tories of 'gerrymandering' the electoral system  
Corbyn says fair elections are under attack.
Having narrowly won the general election, the Tories are now trying to rig the system to keep themselves in power, and weaken opposition ... both inside and outside parliament.
Late last year they drove through a new voter registration scheme that will slash the number of young and inner-city voters ... And later this Parliament they will cut the number of parliamentary seats ... The Conservatives are gerrymandering the electoral system to benefit themselves.

Corbyn says Labour governments have delivered fairness.
Fairness isn't just an abstract morality that we claim, it is something we together - as Labour - have delivered over decades in Britain. 
Labour governments only became possible when everyone had the vote ... men and women ... working class as well as the propertied classes ... It was the labour movement, the trade unions, the Suffragettes and our Party that campaigned for that to happen. 
Universal suffrage is inherently fair... And we used its electoral force to create a fairer Britain... 
Anyone can wrap their policies in the language of 'fairness', it is only Labour that has delivered fairness through institutions and laws.
This last line gets the first round of applause of the speech.

He says that the first hustings of the campaign took place here, in this very room.
(Actually, it was in the room down below - I was blogging. Andrew Harrop said earlier it became obvious from that moment that Corbyn could win, but I don't remember it like that. At the the assumption in the room seemed to be that Andy Burnham or Yvette Cooper would win.)

 Dugher to suggest May elections are a decisive test for Corbyn  
 Michael Dugher, who was sacked as shadow culture secretary last week,  will be giving a speech to Labour First, a group on the right of the party, later this morning. Some extracts have been released in advance, and it is clear the speech will contain a warning to Jeremy Corbyn. Here are the key points from the extracts we've seen.

Dugher will suggest that the May elections are a decisive test for Corbyn.
The elections in May are a huge test for all of us in the Party but they will also provide the biggest indication yet as to whether Labour is heading in the right direction. We will be able to see what the answer is to that big question: after last year's devastating defeat in the general election, are we getting back in touch with the country or are we moving even further away from the public?

He will argue that Labour has to do well in all parts of the country in May, not just in London.
We face a major electoral test in every corner of the country. The London Mayoral election will be extremely important. We must win in London, but it won't be good enough just to win in London. Labour has to hold onto the Welsh Government. We will also see if Jeremy is right in his conviction that his left wing appeal is the key to turning things around in Scotland. And we have to demonstrate that we are capable under Jeremy's leadership of winning new support and hundreds of new council seats in England. Any Party that really is on its way back to power nationally does so on the back of winning in local government.

He will say Labour figures should focus on fighting the Tories, not on fighting each other.
Let's turn our fire on the Tories, not on ourselves. No one should be in any doubt that this is the most rotten, callous, incompetent Conservative government that we ever seen...
I want Labour to become a party again that the Tories genuinely fear. The biggest gift that we can give to the Tories is to deliver a Labour Party that is uncompetitive...
We've got to show that we can start winning again. We must pick fights with the Tories, not with ourselves. We must focus on the country, not on ourselves. That is how you unite the Party.

 What is the living wage?  
You probably all know this, but here's a quick reminder just in case
 Living wage 
The living wage is a voluntary minimum rate, set by the Living Wage Foundation at a rate intended to provide a decent minimum which a worker could live on. It is currently £9.40 in London and £8.25 outside. Progressive employers commit themselves to paying it voluntarily. This is what Jeremy Corbyn is talking about when he floats the idea of stopping firms paying dividends if they are not paying the living wage.
 National living wage 
This is the beefed-up minimum wage announced by George Osborne in last summer's budget. It starts from April at £7.20 an hour, and employers have to pay it. But it only applies to over-25s.
block-time published-time 10.09am GMT 
 CBI criticises Corbyn's proposed living wage rule for firms  
The conference has not started yet, but the CBI has already criticised Jeremy Corbyn's proposal to prevent firms paying the dividends to shareholders if they are not paying the living wage. This is from Mathew Fell, the CBI's chief of staff.
The idea of politicians stepping into the relationship between a private company and its shareholders would be a significant intervention, and not one that we would support.
block-time published-time 9.58am GMT 
We have not had a lot of new policy from Labour since Jeremy Corbyn won the leadership, but today he's putting some substantial proposals on equality and low pay on the table. He is the keynote speaker at the Fabian Society conference in London and, as Rowena Mason reports in her preview story, he is going to float two proposals that would put significant constraints on big business. Here's an extract from Rowena's story.
Jeremy Corbyn will show he is ready for battle with big business as he proposes barring companies from distributing dividends unless they pay the living wage, and putting in place salary curbs to stop bosses being paid many times more than workers.
The Labour leader will suggest the ideas in a speech at the Fabian Society conference in London on Saturday, arguing that "too much of the proceeds of growth have accumulated to those at the top".
Addressing Labour members, he will say inequality is bad for growth and a fairer society does better in terms of economic stability and wealth creation.
"One proposal is pay ratios between top and bottom, so that the rewards don't just accrue to those at the top," he will say. "Of the G7 nations only the US has greater income inequality than the UK, pay inequality on this scale is neither necessary nor inevitable.
"Another proposal would be to bar or restrict companies from distributing dividends until they pay all their workers the living wage. Only profitable employers will be paying dividends, if they depend on cheap labour for those profits then I think there is a question over whether that is a business model to which we should be turning a blind eye."
And here is the full story.

The speech should be the highlight of the conference, but there are plenty of other good speakers here. These are the events at the conference that I will mostly be focusing on. A full list of speakers is on the Fabian Society website.
10.40am:  Jeremy Corbyn speaks.
11.15am: Panel discussion on the art of opposition, with Stella Creasy MP, the Guardian columnist Owen Jones, Deborah Mattinson, the former Labour pollster, and Tom Baldwin, Ed Miliband's communications director in the last parliament.
12.30pm: Panel discussion on how Britain is changing, and how the left should respond, with Lisa Nandy, the shadow energy secretary, Dan Jarvis and Keir Starmer.
1.40pm:  Sadiq Khan, Labour's candidate for mayor of London, in conversation with the Observer's Heather Stewart.
At a separate event Michael Dugher, who was sacked by Corbyn as shadow culture secretary last week, will also be giving his first speech since he lost his post. I will be covering that too.

James Hird defends 34 banned players and says they are innocent of doping; 
Former Essendon coach says there is no evidence that Essendon's supplements program was illegal, despite ruling by the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

Ben Doherty.

Former Essendon coach James Hird has defended 34 players banned for taking performance-enhancing drugs during his coaching tenure, saying he still believes they are innocent of doping.
Essendon's notorious supplements regime during the 2012 regime - when Hird was coach - resulted last week in a ruling by the Court of Arbitration for Sport upholding a ban from the World Anti-Doping Authority.
The players will miss all of the 2016 season. 
In an interview on Sunday night at the St James Ethics centre, and broadcast on the ABC, Hird said he believed there was no evidence that Essendon's supplements program run by now-banned sports scientist Stephen Dank was illegal. 
"At no time did I ever consider that banned or performance enhancing drugs would be at our club. It was just something that never entered my mind. And I still, to this date, don't believe that anything banned was given to our players.
 Related:  Hird accepts 'a level' of responsibility for Essendon supplements scandal
"No one knows, except Stephen Dank, what he put in those injections, but... why would he go and try and dope our players? It doesn't make any sense."
Wada, in a decision since affirmed by CAS, found Essendon players were being regularly injected with Thymosin Beta 4, a banned peptide. The injections often took place away from the football club, and Hird conceded that the paperwork around the drugs was missing key information about their compliance.
Two Essendon players - whose names have not been made public - were found to have elevated levels of Thymosin Beta 4 in frozen urine samples which were retested by Wada in Germany. No Essendon players mentioned the club's injections regime in Asada testing questionnaires. 
Hird said on Sunday night that Essendon's systems around its supplements scheme had failed on occasion. He said the injection of thymomodulin, which is not banned, were designed to aid recovery and to prevent long-term degenerative wear on players' bodies.
"At certain times, I believe the protocols weren't adhered to and that didn't happen. That was very disappointing.
"It is the reason that 34 young men are now in a position they are in. That is devastating for all of us and most of all devastating for those 34 men and their families."
 Related:  James Hird's inglorious descent from Essendon untouchable to 'unperson' | Jonathan Horn
But he said he still believed the Essendon players were never injected with anything that did not comply with the Wada code.
Hird said "there was no intention by anyone [at Essendon] to cheat the system" at any time, but he conceded that, in hindsight, he should have done more to protect the players.
"I have a level of responsibility, I should have known more, I should have done more. I made decisions in real time that I think, in hindsight were wrong."
Hird detailed a meeting in July 2012, when concerns over Dank's supplements program were first raised. The meeting took place at Hird's house after a match, and several members of club staff said Dank, and high-performance manager Dean Robinson, needed to be sacked. 
Hird said then club president Ian Robson vetoed any decision on their employment, saying the club could not afford to sack the men, and would end up in court if it did.
Hird was also critical of specific senior personnel within the AFL, who he said, were determined to make him the scapegoat for Essendon's supplements program.
"I was told I was going to be the scalp."
Hird stepped down as coach of Essendon late last season. But he said the real victims in the long-running saga were the 34 players, who he said had been "sacrificed".
"They are sitting there going 'What have I done? I have done nothing wrong, why am I in this position?'"

Tennis appears to be in denial but match-fixing claims are not new; 
The current allegations are not the first and a lack of transparency and speed surrounding the investigative process is not helping convince the doubters.

Owen Gibson.

"I think it's always disappointing when stories like this come out just before a big event, because it does detract," said Chris Kermode, the ATP president, of the wave of match-fixing allegations hitting tennis on the eve of the year's first grand slam event in Melbourne.
 Related:  Novak Djokovic tells of being offered $200,000 to fix a match
Well, it does rather. But far from being defensive, the authorities should be welcoming the match-fixing claims as the latest opportunity to prove they are getting to grips with a problem that some at the intersection of gambling, corruption, sport and money believe has been slipping from their grasp. 
"What has happened in the last couple of years is that this has been building up and building up. There has been a sticking plaster put on the problem," said one well-placed insider. "They should have seen this coming. This is not new. No one has had a good word to say about what is going on. It is the tennis authorities not facing up to the problem."
Concerns about match-fixing in tennis are nothing new, particularly at the bottom end of the professional game where winning a tournament can barely cover expenses, but also involving players in the top 100 who regularly appear on confidential "watchlists" drawn up by the Tennis Integrity Unit.
Chris Eaton, the former Fifa security chief who subsequently left for the Qatar-funded International Centre for Sport and Security, has said that tennis is the third-most targeted sport behind football and cricket.
Other experts have said that, if you were going to design a sport to fix, you would come up with tennis or snooker because it is so hard in both cases to prove wrongdoing.
The rapid growth of online betting on a vast swath of matches, from the Futures tournaments on the very bottom rung of the professional ladder to grand slams, had left tennis vulnerable.
 Related:  Tennis match-fixing reports: authorities 'absolutely reject' any cover-up
One of the strongest allegations in the joint investigation by the BBC and BuzzFeed published on Sunday night was based on a nine-year-old report released in May 2008, which recommended that 28 players be investigated. Nothing was done because the authorities changed the rules and said they could not prosecute players investigated under the old ones.
The anti-corruption expert Ben Gunn, one of two British former police officers commissioned to write the report, said he was not in a position to judge the effectiveness of the Tennis Integrity Unit since because its workings were so opaque.
"The transparency of the Tennis Integrity Unit leaves something to be desired. In horse racing we name the individual, we name the charges and we put the finding of the tribunal in the public domain," Gunn told the Guardian on Monday. "It's difficult to gauge how successful they are because we don't know what they're doing."
That report, written by Gunn and Jeff Rees (who became the first head of the TIU), was sparked by a notorious match between the Russian Nikolay Davydenko and the Argentinian MartÌn Vassallo Arg¸ello in the Polish resort of Sopot in 2007. As chronicled at the time, the match attracted millions of pounds on the betting exchange Betfair for Arg¸ello, ranked well below his rival, even as Davydenko raced into a one set to love lead before eventually retiring hurt.
Betfair took the unprecedented step of voiding the market after becoming convinced the hugely unusual betting patterns, described as the most outlandish one investigator had seen for 20 years, meant the vast majority of money was being wagered by those who knew Davydenko would lose.
The report by Gunn and Rees recommended the creation of a new integrity unit to investigate the 28 cases listed and to address the issue proactively in future. It is at this point that the sport's critics believe it sold the pass. Instead of aggressively going after those players and sending a message to the gambling syndicates involved in corrupting young players on the Futures tour and then holding it over them as they progressed through the ranks, they fear the decision was taken to opt for containment.
As with doping crises in athletics and cycling, the fear is that the commercial impetus to protect the image and revenues of the sport has eaten away at the desire to tackle the problem at root. The TIU and the four governing bodies that fund it strongly deny that is the case.
The overall assessment of many within the anti-corruption world is that potential match-fixing - whether of a certain game, set or match as a whole - remains much more of a threat lower down the ladder. But that does not mean it should be taken any less seriously nor that it does not occasionally affect grand slam competition.
Down the years, various media outlets have published versions of the nine so-called "watchlists" referred to by the BBC and most tennis fans would recognise at least a handful. But these are not, in the main, household figures at the very top of their sport.
According to the BBC/BuzzFeed probe, 16 players who have ranked in the top 50 - including at least one grand slam champion - were allowed to continue playing in the past decade despite being flagged to the sport's anti-corruption unit because of suspicious betting patterns surrounding their matches. The ATP strongly insisted that all evidence was followed up and, as acknowledged by all concerned, suspicious betting patterns do not necessarily lead to evidence of wrongdoing. But the biggest problem is that we will never know how to judge progress. Instead critics fear the TIU has gone after low-hanging fruit rather than embarking on the painstaking, difficult-to-prove and tortuous detective work required to prove the less obviously open and shut cases.
The TIU director of integrity, Nigel Willerton, told reporters in Melbourne he would not comment on whether any players on the pro tour were under investigation. But with no perceived threat of being shamed, there is very little jeopardy. To prove they are not in thrall to sponsors and players and avoid accusations of capture, surely greater transparency and far greater resourcing is the only way to go in a sport now worth billions?
 Related:  Tennis match-fixing claims: eight players in Australian Open draw suspected
Paul Scotney, the former head of the British Horseracing Authority's integrity unit who is working with the United Nations on the issue, said the new wave of speculation was a reminder that sport needed to invest properly in tackling the problem.
"This is just another warning that sport should take account of these things and should have proper partnerships with betting operators," said Scotney. "Sport has to do its part, they have to commit resources to it. Betting on sport is going to get bigger because it's part of people's lifestyles now. The issue is going to continue getting worse."
Following a global outbreak of handwringing as the scale of the match fixing issues in football and cricket became clear amid a blizzard of headlines, integrity issues appear to have receded back down the priority list.
Tennis has particular issues around the ease with which players on the Futures and Challenger circuit could be corrupted. Unless it improves prize money and prospects there, temptation will always be at hand.
If there is one lesson of the past year, as trust in football and athletics has been decimated by corruption scandals, it is that sports governing bodies must conduct their business in the light. The never apologise, never explain approach of the TIU does not inspire confidence.
"If you're serious about tackling integrity in sport, you've got to take some angst. You've got to wash some dirty linen to get it clean," concludes Gunn, eight years after he wrote the report still creating waves.

How to look after the NHS as it looks after us.

Letters.

After spending all my working life since the age of 18 in the health service as both a clinician and for the last 17 years as a CEO, I applaud you on your planned month-long portrait of the NHS, when you will go into every area of the service and listen to authentic voices of those on the frontline ( This is the NHS, 18 January). It lifts my heart to at last see a responsible approach being taken to try to get underneath and understand the complexities that face our fantastic health and social care services.
Too often the public are presented with dramatic, sensational headlines about the NHS which both scare and create anxiety for those who have to use the services. Not to mention how the often inaccurate headlines make those who work so hard every day to do the best job they can feel undermined and undervalued. 
Coupled with our politicians, who as Nigel Edwards of the Nuffield Trust says " play fast and loose with data ", it is little wonder that as a population we can be rather confused as to what is the clear view of the NHS. At the weekend the Sunday Times published a letter from more than 20 leading stroke consultants from across the country that quite simply destroyed the current political statements regarding variations in death rates over weekdays and weekends in the NHS - the "fact" that has been the central reason to change doctors' contracts and thus precipitate the first doctors' strike in years.
The complexities of our NHS will always exist and the service will always be evolving and require change to meet our needs. This will only be achieved if we allow this debate to happen in an environment that is not governed by a five-year electoral timeframe and with a population who are provided with honest and clear facts. Thank you, Polly Toynbee, and your colleagues for making a start. Jo CubbonWest Charleton, Devon
∑ Well done on your four-week project on the NHS, which is indeed "a British glory". Perhaps one should await all your findings before comment, but I cannot resist contrasting today's Westminster/Whitehall attitudes to bureaucracy and centralisation with those prevailing at the inception of the NHS in 1948-49.
My dear old dad was appointed by Aneurin Bevan to chair the hospital committee for West Suffolk (then a separate county) responsible for overseeing the introduction of the NHS. I followed him around on hospital visits. On takeover day he attended the office of the CEO (Major Tolputt, I seem to recall) of the county committee in Bury St Edmunds. They were put on their mettle, to say the least, by the paucity of instruction/guidance - a single foolscap sheet of paper! Today it would be a book.
In her perspicacious piece ( For a clear view of the NHS, look past the politics and promises of a cure, 18 January), Polly Toynbee majors on contemporary hyper-centralisation and complexity. She rightly refers to the endless well-intentioned tinkering by politicians and civil servants alike, often if not usually born of theoretical zeal unfettered by organic experience of that which they are "reforming". That is made much worse by endless job chop and change.
Unless we face head-on these profound issues (which, of course, affect all aspects of government) we will continue going backwards. Andrew PhillipsSudbury, Suffolk
∑ The NHS budget is about the same as the GDP of New Zealand, which would make it the 55th largest country in the world, yet it is has little democratic oversight at any level. Public participation through Health Watch, NHS Citizen, patient participation groups etc can be ignored or abolished if ministers don't like what people say.
All but one of the 33 "rights" in the NHS constitution are about people as consumers, not citizens. Our "right to be involved, directly or through representatives, in the planning of healthcare services commissioned by NHS bodies" has no statutory mechanisms apart from voting for an MP every five years. Every secretary of state has the power to restructure the NHS if they can get it through parliament, but citizens have no statutory say from day to day. The Francis report on the Mid Staffordshire scandal and the review of hospital complaints by Ann Clwyd MP and Professor Tricia Hart highlighted the human costs when people do not have a voice.
The challenges facing health and social care make it essential for citizens to be involved in democratic scrutiny and strategic decisions at all levels. We need a national "Parliament for Health" and better integration with local councils to democratise the NHS, using methods of deliberative democracy as well as elected representatives. I hope the Guardian will explore the many models of democratic participation and accountability for health, so that we can learn from across the UK and the world. Health is too important and complex to run through command and control or clinical commissioning alone. Only by empowering citizens to have an effective voice will we be able to make the difficult decisions needed for a sustainable health service. Titus AlexanderDemocracy Matters
∑ Massive demographic changes and medical innovations, which also raise patients' expectations about treatment, account for increasing demands on the NHS. We may get the best-value healthcare system in the world, but people who want more should note that we only spend 8.5% of GDP on it at present, and that this figure is due to fall to 7.8% by 2020. In contrast, Germany, France and Holland all spend around 11% of GDP on health. The NHS is financed by taxpayers and the basic rate of income tax in the UK has gradually fallen from 35% to 20% since 1975-76. The time has therefore come to consider a hypothecated health and social care tax if we are to get better health services, as well as the best-value system. Chris RennardLiberal Democrat, House of Lords
∑ Good on the Guardian for your coverage of the NHS, which, as you say, exists for the good health of us all. You have timed this to coincide with a discussion we are having as to whether running a nuclear weapons programme is justified as a job provider.
The structure of the British health profession, and the NHS in particular, has lent itself exceptionally well to fostering multi-disciplinary research and development in a wide range of fields, from drugs to imaging technology, putting our own industry on an inside track for job-creative exploitation. Unfortunately, and partly because of the temptation of easier money from weapons production, we have missed out on some good chances: much of the basis of modern imaging technology - "scanning" - for example, has come from British basic research (earning two Nobel prizes), and yet almost all the jobs have gone abroad.
Just a thought, but maybe, in part of your NHS coverage, it would be good to take a closer look at this. Professor CR HillEmeritus professor of physics as applied to medicine, Institute of Cancer Research and Royal Marsden hospital

NHS sugar tax leaves bitter lessons to be learned.

Letters.

While the introduction of a sugar tax on health-damaging foods sold on NHS premises is to be welcomed ( NHS to introduce a sugar tax, 18 January), we need to be clear that this is not about improving patients' health but an attempt to stop destroying it. 
The epidemic of obesity is caused by a number of factors, but top of the league by far are sugary foods and drinks. The consumption of these products is aided and abetted by an effective food industry parliamentary lobby, compliant politicians and indifferent supermarkets where 80% of products sold have added sugar.
When a GP, I advised 300 patients to stop adding sugar to hot drinks, to give up sugary drinks and to have confectionery, biscuits, buns and cakes for special occasions only - or never. Their average weight loss was 7%, persisting over three years until I retired. Translated across the population, this simple measure could save untold expense and, more importantly, the misery and premature death associated with our high intake of that slow-acting metabolic poison called sugar.
The imperative must be for patients, staff and visitors to find on sale in NHS premises only health-promoting foods. This would be an educational experience in itself, and create pressure for a more generalised sugar penalty.If the scandal of our national diet, which in reality is an ongoing mass poisoning event, is not sorted out, then we will need a very much bigger, indeed, obese NHS to deal with its consequences. Dr Colin BannonCrapstone, Devon
∑ A sugar tax on products sold in hospitals might be better than nothing, but how about taking out the wretched vending machines that sell the stuff? They don't just sell sugar, they sell water that costs as much as the sugary drinks, and other non-food junk. Or are the machines - as schools found out when they tried to remove them - part of the PFI deals that were foisted on the organisations? A genuine mea culpa from New Labour and a new policy from Jeremy Corbyn etc to address the disaster that is PFI would be a huge step in the right direction. Maybe then we could actually afford the NHS. Judith MartinWinchester
∑ While the NHS sugar tax is a step in the right direction, why don't they stop selling such products altogether? It would also help if the government wasn't taking "advice" from, and being influenced by, those with a vested interest in perpetuating this problem. John CarterLondon
∑ Surely the aim should be to have nil revenue from the sugar levy? Anne HoldomGreat Bourton, Oxfordshire

Naked artist Deborah de Robertis decries 'hypocrisy' of Paris gallery arrest; 
The 31-year-old Luxembourg-born artist was detained after stripping off in front of Manet's Olympia at Paris's MusÈe d'Orsay.

Kim Willsher in Paris.

Performance artist Deborah de Robertis vowed to continue making an exhibition of herself after stripping off in front of a nude painting by Edouard Manet led to her spending nearly two days in a police cell.
The 31-year-old was unrepentant after a Paris judge threw out a charge of public indecency after she stripped off at Paris's MusÈe d'Orsay and mimicked the pose of Manet's celebrated painting, Olympia, wearing nothing but a portable camera to film the public's reaction. 
"I wanted to represent the model in the painting but in a contemporary setting. But the guards ran up and covered me with a sheet then stood in front to hide my nudity from the public," De Robertis said on Monday, shortly after she had been released from police custody.  
"I'd taken some friends along as a kind of false audience and set up a mise-en-scene so they'd applaud if the situation got difficult, but other spectators in the real audience were clapping too. The guards were trying to clear the room, but not everyone wanted to leave."
As De Robertis attempted to continue her performance on Saturday afternoon, museum staff asked her to get dressed. When she refused they called the police who hauled her off and put her in a cell. 
After appearing in court on Monday, the Luxembourg-born artist accused the MusÈe d'Orsay, which is exhibiting Manet's Olympia as part of its Splendours and Miseries: Images of Prostitution 1850-1910 exhibition, of "total hypocrisy". 
"The museum is perfectly happy to use nudity when it comes to encouraging people to come to the exhibition, and there are even pornographic films being shown in the museum, but when it comes to a contemporary artistic performance like mine, they don't recognise it as art, and they censor it," De Robertis said. 
"They like nudity in art, they just don't want it to be moving. I don't understand how you can have this kind of exhibition if you are not prepared to go to examine nudity in the real world." 
De Robertis has history for scandalising the MusÈe d'Orsay. In May 2014, she posed exposing her vulva in front of Gustave Courbet's Origin of the World, which depicts female genitalia. 
"In both cases, I chose works of art that scandalised people at the time they were produced, so another aspect of what I am doing is to recreate the scandal in a contemporary setting," De Robertis said. 
"This time I wanted to show the feminine model Olympia in the age of the iPhone." 
A spokesperson for the museum said: "The guards reacted quickly. They closed the room and asked her to get dressed. When she refused, the police were called and took her away." 
The artist's lawyer, Tewfik Bouzenoune, said arresting artists and throwing them in a cell was a "seriously negative message". 
"The MusÈe d'Orsay has organised this and other exhibitions featuring nudity and there are posters advertising them all over Paris. So, the museum is happy to use the nude as a marketing tool, but refuses to see an artist posing naked as art. 
"Deborah de Robertis is an artist. She was just doing her job. She made a performance and ended up in a police cell. We have to ask what kind of impact this sort of censorship has on the creativity of artists if they have the sword of legal action hanging over them."

Big banks still have a problem with ethics and morality; 
The biggest compliment you can get in the City is 'professional'. It means you do not let emotions get in the way of work, let alone morals.

Joris Luyendijk.

Amid all the misunderstandings about global finance, the idea that bankers are a bunch of coke-snorting evildoers on the model of Gordon Gekko or the Wolf of Wall Street is probably the most widespread. It is also largely wrong. Worse: this stereotype stops us from seeing the real issue in finance and the publicly listed corporate world generally.
When interviewing around 200 bankers and banking staff about finance and morality in the City of London for the Guardian, I was struck by the language they used. Not so much the profanities, though there were many, nor the technical stuff and the three-letter acronyms (TLAs). Most striking were terms that seemed designed to sidestep any possibility of an ethical discussion. When talking of their bank's use of loopholes in the tax code to help big corporations and rich families evade taxes, bankers used words such as "tax optimisation" or "tax-efficient structures".  
Financial lawyers and regulators who went along with whatever banks propose were called business-friendly, cases of proven fraud or abuse became mis-selling and exploiting inconsistencies between two countries' regulatory systems or playing them off against each other was regulatory arbitrage.
 Related:  Michael Lewis: the scourge of Wall Street
In the City, people explained, you do not ask if a proposal is right or wrong. You look at whether the plan is profitable and whether it is compliant, ie in accordance with the law. 
This is why the cliche of the immoral banker simply does not hold up. Banks have vast structures with tens of thousands of staff in departments called risk compliance and internal audit. They have a mind-boggling mountain of rules from regulators, both national, European and global, to contend with. Leaving the inevitable rotten apples and the traders caught up in the Libor and foreign exchange scandals aside, almost all bankers are paranoid about breaking the rules. However, banking staff working in risk and compliance, the legal department and internal audit told me the question is always: how can we game the system within the rules?

Bankers are not immoral
This is the problem with finance. The reason so few people went to prison for the 2008 crash is not some global conspiracy. There are extremely worrying forms of political corruption by the big banks, from campaign donations and insane speaker fees for former politicians to the revolving door between regulators, banks and political parties. However, the most important reasons we have seen so few bankers in orange jumpsuits disappear into a jail was that their action were mostly legal.
And that was all there was to it. In the years leading up to 2008, the bankers involved in the products that were to blow up did not ask if they were good for clients, for the economy, or even for their bank - which could fire them in five minutes anyway. The bankers wanted to know if what they did was legal and, if so, then that was the end of the discussion.
In most conversations the word 'ethic' came up only in combination with 'work'
In interviews I often question people on ethics, and soon enough we hit the underlying principle: amorality. Everybody said amoral is not the same as immoral. Gordon Gekko was immoral as he knowingly broke the law. Same with the Wolf of Wall Street.
Amoral, however, means that the terms good and evil simply have no part in the decision-making process. The question is whether something is allowed and, if so, the only remaining question is that of reputation risk: how will this look on the news?
People talked about compartmentalisation: being a strict Christian at home but during the day selling lucrative (to the bank) financial products to "some guy at a small bank in Sweden" who clearly doesn't understand what he is buying. The biggest compliment in the City is to call someone professional. It means you do not let emotions get in the way of work, let alone moral beliefs - those are for home. In most conversations the word ethics came up only in combination with work, referring to an almost absolute obedience to one's boss.
The problem with the big banks then is not that they are immoral. They are amoral; their employees believe they have only one task and that is to make as much money as possible for shareholders within the law.
 Related:  Why working fewer hours would make us more productive
Could it be more terrifying? Bankers absolve themselves of any moral responsibility by referring to laws that their lobbyists have helped write. Even more terrifying, laws always catch up with technology and so initially there are no rules governing new products, such as the synthetic collateralised debt obligations that nearly sank the world economy in 2008 when they suddenly exploded.
Apart from lots of solemn pledges about cultural change, nothing has been done after 2008 about the amoral organising principle of publicly listed banks. If you then realise that bankers can still be fired in five minutes, you begin to see why so many critics claim that in spite of all the new rules, nothing has changed. It is back to business as usual. And business as usual in finance means on to the next crash.

ITV director of television Peter Fincham to be replaced by Kevin Lygo; 
Outgoing executive says he is considering move into independent production sector after eight years at broadcaster.

Mark Sweney.

Peter Fincham, ITV's director of television, is stepping down and will be replaced by ITV Studios managing director Kevin Lygo.
Fincham, who has been with ITV for eight years, said he is considering a move to the independent production sector.
"This is a personal decision that I have been thinking about for a good while," he said. "By the time I leave at Easter, I will have been a channel controller at the BBC and ITV, amazing as it seems, for 11 years. Quite simply, it's time to do something different." 
"I haven't made any firm plans for the future yet, but I wouldn't rule out a return to the indie sector. I ran [production company] TalkBack [Thames] for a lot longer than I've been on the broadcasting side and that indie heart has never quite stopped beating."
ITV also announced that ITV Studios UK managing director Julian Bellamy, an ex-Channel 4 and Discovery senior executive, is to step up to take over running the global studios business from Lygo.
"Peter came to see me in September to say that he wanted to step down and whilst I am sorry to see him leave, eight years is a long time and I fully respect his desire for a new challenge," said ITV chief executive Adam Crozier. 
"He and I have worked closely together since I joined ITV and he has been a great creative partner and has led a brilliant creative transformation of ITV's programming, launching some of the biggest shows on British television. We wish him all the very best for the future."
Since joining ITV in 2008, Fincham has been responsible for a creative renaissance at the broadcaster including dramas Downton Abbey, Broadchurch and Cilla.
Prior to ITV, Fincham has been controller of BBC1 but was forced to resign over the "crowngate" scandal, in which promotional footage of documentary A Year With the Queen was falsely edited to give the impression the Queen had stormed out of a photo shoot. 
The announcement comes a week after Fincham's friend Tim Hincks announced he was to leave Big Brother and MasterChef maker Endemol Shine, prompting speculation the pair may look to launch their own production company. 
Lygo, Channel 4's former director of television and content, joined ITV in 2010 after missing out on the C4 chief executive role to David Abraham. 
While considered at the time to have been more of a natural fit for the role taken by Fincham - a position he has waited almost six years to step into - Lygo nevertheless oversaw tremendous growth in ITV Studios revenues from about £600m to an expected £1bn-plus this year.
"I've had a terrific time over the last five years building ITV Studios in the UK and internationally into the success story that it is today, but the chance to become Director of Television of the UK's biggest commercial broadcaster was just too good to miss," said Lygo. "I can't wait to get started. "Peter has done an amazing job in leading the creative resurgence of ITV's programming. I have enjoyed working closely with him during that time and wish him the very best for the future."
Bellamy joined ITV from Discovery in 2014. He worked at Channel 4 at the same time as Lygo and also left in 2010 after missing out on the role of chief creative officer to Jay Hunt. 
"Over the last few years, ITV Studios has gone from strength to strength and grown into a great global content company," said Bellamy. "I am very much looking forward to taking the business to the next level working with the best creative teams in the business both in the UK and internationally."
Lygo and Bellamy will begin their new roles on February 1 with Fincham remaining at ITV until the end of March to complete the handover process.

Missing Hong Kong bookseller 'confesses' on Chinese state TV; 
Gui Minhai is one of five men linked to books critical of Beijing, who have vanished in recent months.

Tom Phillips in Beijing.

A Hong Kong publisher whose disappearance last year sparked an international scandal and street protests has reappeared, making a televised "confession" on China's government-controlled broadcaster CCTV.
Gui Minhai, a 51-year-old Swedish citizen who specialised in salacious tomes about China's Communist party elite, vanished from his beachfront home in Thailand in October last year.
 Related:  Gui Minhai: the strange disappearance of a publisher who riled China's elite 
His disappearance - and the apparent abductions of four other booksellers with whom he worked - was widely suspected to be the work of Chinese security forces, although Beijing repeatedly refused to comment on the whereabouts of the missing men. 
Earlier this month thousands of demonstrators took to the streets  of Hong Kong, a former British colony, after Lee Bo, a British passport holder who had worked with Gui, became the fifth bookseller to go missing. 
During a visit last week to Beijing, Philip Hammond, the British foreign secretary, said that if Chinese authorities had been responsible for Lee's disappearance it would represent an "egregious breach" of Hong Kong's supposed autonomy from the authoritarian mainland.
The motive for the disappearances remains a mystery but Gui and Lee are understood to have been preparing to publish a book about the private life of Xi Jinping, China's president.
On Sunday night China finally broke its silence over the case by broadcasting what it said was a confession made by Gui on state broadcaster CCTV.
The publisher claimed he had voluntarily surrendered to Chinese authorities in October last year over his supposed involvement in a fatal hit-and-run incident in the city of Ningbo in December 2003.
Gui said he had fled mainland China after the incident, in which a young woman was killed, but had been driven to return last year out of guilt and a sense of longing for his homeland. "It is my own choice to come back and to confess my crime. It is nobody else's business. I need to take responsibility for it myself," he said in the televised confession. 
Gui had last been seen in security footage shot outside his flat in Thailand last October. There was immediate scepticism among China experts and human rights activists over the "confession" - the latest in a series of such broadcasts, in which Communist party opponents have appeared since Xi came to power.
William Nee, Amnesty International's China researcher, said: "Even if this story is true - which is a big if - it still leaves many unanswered questions.
"Why would four other employees of a company need to go missing in order to assist with a regular criminal case? How could other missing or otherwise investigated colleagues of Gui Minhai have any connection to the case? What form of detention is Gui Minhai held under? Has he had access to legal counsel or consular visits, and if [not], why not?"

Before his disappearance, Gui had become a major irritant for China's leaders. He specialised in sketchily sourced tabloid-style tomes about the private lives of senior party officials - including one book chronicling the alleged sexual escapades of Bo Xilai, the former Chongqing party chief, whose wife was jailed for the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood.
Another well known volume examined the private life of Zhou Yongkang, China's once feared security tsar who was jailed for life for corruption earlier this year. Recent months had seen Gui's publisher produce a flurry of books about President Xi. 
The CCTV report did not disclose where Gui was being held. Xinhua, China's official news agency, said the publisher was also suspected of other unspecified crimes.

Air pollution at this level for 10 more years will put a generation at risk; 
The courts must be involved: the quality of air our children breathe is too important to be decided in secret by ministers and the motor trade.

Justine Thornton.

When I was eight years old, I used to hold my breath when I walked to school. My route was along a busy road, and I had been told that lead in petrol hurt children's brains. I stopped worrying as the years went by and there was a successful campaign to ban it. But now I sometimes find myself coughing as I wait on my bike behind a London bus and its fumes catch in my throat.
 Related:  London takes just one week to breach annual air pollution limits 
The science is clear: nitrogen dioxide from road traffic is seriously bad for our health - particularly for children and elderly people, because it can inflame our lungs and lower our resistance to respiratory infections such as bronchitis. So much so that 23,500 people in the UK are expected to die prematurely every year because of this air pollution. Imagine if knife crime or terrorism were killing people in these numbers - it would be described as a national crisis.
In the old days we could at least see the smog. But this is an invisible killer, hidden from sight and sheltered from political controversy.
Great swaths of the UK have nitrogen dioxide levels that are considered unsafe for human health. One of the main culprits is emissions from diesel vehicles. As we now know from the Volkswagen scandal, the emissions from diesel vehicles are often much higher than predicted in lab tests.
Public disquiet about all this is, at last, beginning to stir. There is concern about the impact a third runway at Heathrow would have on already shockingly bad air pollution levels in the capital. The House of Commons environment committee recently said Heathrow should not be allowed to expand unless the government can demonstrate that air quality is within legal limits.
In 2007 the high court told the then Labour government its public consultation on nuclear power was seriously flawed
What has not been talked about much is the role of the courts in forcing the government to take action. As a barrister specialising in environmental law, I regularly see the tension between the courts and governments of different colours over environmental issues. In 2007 I watched with interest as the high court told the then Labour government that its public consultation on nuclear power was seriously flawed. Now inaction over air pollution means it is the turn of the current Conservative government to face sanction.
Last year the supreme court reached its judgment in a long-running legal challenge by the campaign group ClientEarth over UK breaches of European air pollution law. Britain is not alone in breaching EU law: a number of other member states are in a similar position.
Here, the supreme court has ordered the government to produce a plan to reduce nitrogen dioxide levels to safe levels in as short a timescale as possible. It gave the government six months to do so, and allowed ClientEarth to return to court in the event it is not satisfied with the response. Forcing the government to act in this way was an unusual move because courts usually accept Whitehall's word that it will take steps to meet its legal obligations. In doing so, the court said it had been influenced by the seriousness of the legal breach and the way air pollution had continued to worsen over the last four years, during which time the litigation has been running.
The courts recognise that reducing air pollution will not be easy. In the ClientEarth case, the high court judge referred to the "heavy burden of expenditure" on taxpayers and individuals "which would require difficult political choices to be made".
The government published its revised air pollution plans in the runup to Christmas. Given the legal backdrop, it may not be entirely coincidental that shortly before the plans were published the decision on a third runway at Heathrow was delayed to enable a further look at air pollution and other environmental concerns.
Judicial pressure appears to be having a direct effect on the government. At the court hearing in April 2015 the government told the supreme court that parts of London, the West Midlands and West Yorkshire would still be at illegal limits in 2030. Under the plan produced in December, the timescales for compliance have shortened. The West Midlands and Yorkshire are expected to be in compliance with legal levels in 2020, London in 2025.
That is not good enough for ClientEarth, which accuses the government of still putting short-term political priorities ahead of public health and people's lives. The revised plan soft-pedals on pollution by private motorists while the government appears intent on watering down EU legal limits for vehicle emissions.
 Related:  Government passing the buck on air pollution, say campaigners
The stage is set for a fascinating tussle between law and politics. The British court will have to roll up its sleeves and decide whether this government is doing what it can to make our air as safe as possible. No matter how tough the political choices, EU law has consistently made clear that financial and political difficulties are no defence for countries that fail to comply with their legal obligations. The European court has said it is up to national courts to call their governments to account for air pollution failures.
I hope the courts closely scrutinise the government's plan. Ten more years of dangerous air pollution in the capital puts a whole generation of children at risk. Judicial review can assist in identifying the political choices made on our behalf in the plan, to better inform public debate about the difficult decisions ahead.
Securing the proper boundary between the role of unelected judges in determining legality, and elected government in determining policy and priorities, is never easy. The supreme court will be fully aware of the sensitivities involved, but equally the court is clearly determined not to allow the government to duck its legal duties to citizens. The quality of the air our children breathe is too important to be decided behind closed doors by the government and vehicle manufacturers.

UN whistleblower who exposed sexual abuse by peacekeepers is exonerated; 
Anders Kompass 'relieved but sad' after being cleared of wrongdoing for revealing abuse in Central African Republic.

Sandra Laville.

The UN whistleblower who exposed the sexual abuse of children by peacekeepers in Central African Republic has been completely exonerated after an internal investigation. 
Anders Kompass, the director of field operations for the office of the high commissioner for human rights in Geneva, was suspended and faced dismissal after he passed confidential documents detailing the abuse of children by French troops in CAR to the authorities in Paris because of the UN's failure to stop the exploitation.
 Related:  France's poisoned legacy in the Central African Republic 
The scandal was first reported by the Guardian in April last year, with the child sex allegations and the treatment of Kompass gaining worldwide attention. The UN repeatedly condemned his actions, insisting that he had breached protocols by sharing a secret internal document.
For nine months he was under a disciplinary investigation but a few days ago Kompass was informed in a letter that the internal investigation, run by the Office of Internal Oversight (OIOS), had cleared him of all charges.
His exoneration comes just weeks after an independent panel report - set up by the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-Moon, into the child sex scandal in CAR - ruled Kompass had done nothing wrong in passing the internal document, which contained interviews with victims and descriptions of the perpetrators, to the French.
The panel report condemned the "gross institutional failure" of the UN in its inaction over the allegations of child sexual abuse in CAR.
Speaking for the first time about his ordeal, Kompass told the Guardian: "I feel relief and some sadness. It is still a mystery why most of the UN leadership decided to do this to me when they knew very well how badly the UN was handling these types of cases and they knew there was a big gap in terms of under reporting of these kind of cases.
"It is important for other staff to see that I was vindicated. That's one of the reasons I had to go through this to give an example to the staff - in particular the younger staff - because otherwise the message was: 'If you try to do something similar to what Anders has done these will be the consequences.'"
It was not until Kompass passed the report to the French that any investigation into the allegations began. French officials thanked him for what he had done, even as his employers pursued their investigation against him. The alleged abuses took place while French peacekeepers were supposed to be protecting civilians at a camp for internally displaced people near the airport in the capital, Bangui, between December 2013 and June 2014.
The confidential report - entitled Sexual Abuse of Children by International Armed Forces - contained details about the rape and sodomy of starving and homeless young boys by French peacekeepers at the camp. The interviews with children had been carried out by a member of staff from the office of the high commissioner for human rights in 2014, and a staff member from Unicef, but no action had been taken by the UN and the information was not passed to the French until Kompass decided to act.
 Related:  Ostracised, sacked ... and even arrested: the fate of whistleblowers at the UN
Last month, the independent panel's report into the scandal was withering in its criticism of UN procedures when faced with the allegations that French peacekeepers - operating under the authorisation of the security council - were sexually abusing young children in CAR. The panel inquiry - led by the Canadian judge Marie Deschamps - found that children as young as nine were encouraged to take part in oral sex in exchange for food or money in the middle of the war zone.
Initial complaints in early 2014 were "passed from desk to desk, inbox to inbox, across multiple UN offices, with no one willing to take responsibility", the report said. It said UN staff became overly concerned with whether the allegations had been improperly leaked to the French by Kompass, and focused on protocols rather than action.
Recognising Kompass's seniority, extensive experience in field missions and the fact that human rights officials had not followed up the allegations despite the need for urgent action, the panel report said they could make no adverse finding against him. The panel criticised the then head of the OIOS, Carmen La Pointe, for abusing her authority by initiating the internal investigation into Kompass. She left her post last September after five years in office.
Kompass, who was allowed back to his post in May last year after an appeal tribunal found his suspension was illegal, has been waiting nine months with his career on the line. He has received no apology or acknowledgement from senior UN officials since he was exonerated by the disciplinary investigation on 8 January.
The ordeal has left him disappointed and full of sadness. Kompass said after 17 years working within the office of the high commissioner for human rights he was seriously considering his options within the UN.
"The CAR panel came out last month, and I then had wait for this investigation to report. Now I have got the letter from the OIOS and I am free," he said.
"I had to stay because I wanted to see this through. But now that it's over, it keeps being very difficult for me. No one has said anything to me, no one has apologised to me. I think many of us expected they might do so particularly after everything that has happened. But nothing has been said, and I probably just have to accept that, although it is very disappointing.
"And now I have to take a decision about my future and I confess, I am seriously considering all the options."

Ali Smith on Trumpet by Jackie Kay: a jazzy call to action; 
Based on the real life story of an American musician, Jackie Kay's Trumpet, an examination of when private life turns horribly public, says things about gender and ethnicity that had never been said before.

Ali Smith.

This novel, with its brightly proclamatory title, a title promising loudness, confident statement, irrefutable presence and exuberance, even a kind of jazzy brashness or biblical heft, begins in immediate contradiction with a notable quietness, a state of wounded and private withdrawal. The first thing it does is reveal someone hiding behind closed curtains, peeking fearfully out, keen not to be seen. "House and Home" is the title of its opening section. Pretty soon we gather that "House and Home" is meant in the sense of a typical media heading, like a style section in a newspaper, and that intense media observation in the form of a small crowd of paparazzi has left the person feeling invaded, hunted, "strange". "Each time I look at the photographs in the papers, I look unreal." 
She - a few pages on we find out that the speaker is a woman - feels guilty, even vaguely criminal. So what has she done to merit feeling like this? Has there been a death? Is there a scandal? The novel begins with this forced unhoming, from both the house and the self ("I am not myself any longer ... I crept out of my house in the middle of the night with a thief's racing heart"). Pretty soon it becomes clear that "House and Home" stands for a clash between the private and public worlds, and that this clash raises questions about how we calculate what's real and what's imagined about ourselves, and what's allowed and forbidden too. This is just the start - a human, very vulnerable start, and sure enough, this extraordinary novel, which came out nearly 20 years ago, will be in the end very much about homecoming, home truths.
Funny and visceral, this story about marriage, family, death, loss, song and above all love, whose "scandalous revelation" is a cleansing, empowering and beautiful one, celebrates expansiveness and imaginative shapeshift. So far Trumpet is Jackie Kay's only novel. I say "so far" in the knowledge that she's working on another right now and I know this because we're friends. We didn't know each other, though, in 1998, when I first went into a shop in Edinburgh and, seeing Trumpet on a table, bought it immediately - I knew Kay's poems well and had read a couple of her plays too. When I read it, I knew I had never read a book like it. There had certainly never been a Scottish book like it, yet it came from the Scottish tradition of honouring the margins, the vernacular and the ordinariness of things and lives (an "ordinariness" that is always extraordinary). It came from a literary tradition of shapeshift itself, one that finds voice in unauthorised, unexpected forms and places; one often concerned with the search for a communal form, a tradition that can be traced in writers such as Lewis Grassic Gibbon, Hugh MacDiarmid, Nan Shepherd, Willa Muir, Alasdair Gray, Liz Lochhead, James Kelman. It came from such tradition and expanded it with influences from international black writers such as Audre Lorde, J amaica Kincaid, and especially Zora Neale Hurston and Toni Morrison. Plus, it said things about and for that Scottish tradition, and about and for a wider British tradition as well, concerning gender and ethnicity, that had never been said before.
 Related:  A life in writing: Jackie Kay
My 1998 edition summarises its plot on the flyleaf of its dust jacket, in that way publishers like to do to catch the attention of a browsing reader: "Celebrated Joss Moody has died and the jazz world is in mourning. But in death Joss can no longer guard the secret he kept all his life, and Colman, his adoring adopted son, must confront the truth: the man whom he believed to be his father was, in fact, a woman." What a spoiler, I thought, especially after I'd read the opening sections of the novel and experienced a story so far from the bluntness of this summary as to be near unrecognisable. But then again, one of Trumpet 's concerns, along with an ultra-sensitive understanding of "the private life that turns suddenly and horrifically public", is finding a means of working against the reductive power of certain kinds of storytelling, certain ways of telling "truth" about real lives. It does this on a larger scale than just by referencing the media's way with us. Sophie Stones, for instance - the journalist who wants to make a fortune from the story of Joss Moody ("Transvestite has a nice pervy ring to it," she thinks, sure that the book she's writing with Joss's son will change her life) - reassures herself that she's got every right to get as much money and kudos out of cheap true-life revelation as she wants. She thinks that's the way of the world, and for her it's a particularly gender-trapped way of the world. "Why should I have scruples when men have been using me for years?"
                     Trumpet  is, in a consciously much more subtle way, very much about revelation. It's about the stories that change our lives, about the unexpected possibilities in those closest to us, and the unexpected shapes real family takes. It repeats its "shocking" revelation about Joss's gender over and over, to calibrate a shimmering response from the repeating unbindings (as if unbinding the question of gender each time) so that we judge human nature not by the shock of the revelation of Joss's gender but by people's responses to it. "The trumpet man that turned out to be a woman": one of Trumpet 's inspirations was the real-life story that broke in the media in the 1990s of Billy Tipton, an American jazz musician and bandleader born a woman, Dorothy Lucille Tipton. The story became international news after Tipton's death, as his family wrangled over his will. Jackie Kay's Joss Moody / Josephine Moore perhaps gestures more, though, to the dancer, singer, civil rights and resistance worker Josephine Baker. Born in Missouri, she was the first world-famous black woman, and a woman who, incidentally, outlived her first obituaries and the wartime report of her own death by three decades.
                     Trumpet is a novel fascinated by "the significance of names", and by what words do when they're meant to mean, well, us. In a defining act, the doctor who examines Joss's corpse overwrites in "large childish letters" the word male with the word female on the death certificate, then goes out into the "pale, bloodless light" of a new morning - and blood is important in a book that so profoundly declares itself to be about parenting, family and, crucially, the role the imagination plays in these matters. "Make up your own bloodline, Colman. Make it up and trace it back. Design your own family tree - what's the matter with you? Haven't you got an imagination?"
The book's protagonists, Millie and Joss, one black, one white, fall for each other at a time when it's still close to taboo, and first see each other when they're giving blood (Baker's own anti-racism novel My Blood in Your Veins was published in 1931 and she went on to adopt a family of children of different ethnicities - her "rainbow tribe").
Jackie Kay's work, formally expansive and inclusive, often an exploration of the hurt done by small-mindedness and its attendant exclusivity, is always about the opening up of our notions of identity. Here Joss's public/private fusion of identity - a fusion that produces the possibilities of improvisation, a different music, a sense of play between all the selves, of possibilities for quite other selves in those round him and in us too - is a question of open source. He makes the world more local and more open both at once. "His father was African, his mother Scottish. He doesn't know the exact country, just the continent, he laughs gamely. 'It's a big fucking continent, so it is.'"
Then there's the trumpet itself, phallic and feline at once, purring from its fur-lined box in descriptive terms you'd never expect to see applied to something like a trumpet. As a symbol, and in reality, a trumpet is not exactly subtle. We expect it to be brash. We expect it to be loud. We expect it to be undeniable. Here it becomes a whole new blues double-entendre. "Why not a woman playing a fucking trumpet, man, what's wrong with that?" as Colman puts it, while the novel laughs at the daftness in our traditionally received notions about gender and overturns them to such an extent that it starts to become obscene, an act of deep disrespect and ignorance, when people refer to the Joss we know as "she" instead of "he".
It is just one of the magical reversals of preconception in the novel. "Joss's trumpet was like a magician's hat." The funeral director, one of the many "mouth pieces" that come together to make this novel's orchestration, thinks to himself, amazed, how "he had never had a man turn into a woman before his very eyes. He felt it to be one of those defining moments in his life that he would be compelled to return to again and again."
The moment at which definition breaks open - that's the true defining moment, in a book full of "the peat smell of jazz", built from the layered echoes, repetitions and rhythms of a music that earthily "unwraps" us, frees us from sex, race and memory; its music acts as lifeblood, birth, lovemaking and transformation, most especially in the extraordinary section called "Music", in which any notion of the fixed self, any too-fixed summarising, ecstatically gives way, "collapses".
Kay has always been a watcher, a tracer of the "true" story, or, as Millie sees it, the difference between living a lie and living a life - maybe even an afterlife, since Trumpet is also its own book of revelation. Here are Millie and Joss now, in the 21st century, coming out of a Glasgow jazz bar back in the 1950s and into the dark of the brave new world like "people who have just landed on the planet all at once together with the same pioneering, fierce look on our faces". This fiercely pioneering work makes the walls between us come tumbling down. In a love song to our human versatilities, a uniting of many voices into a forgiving set of harmonies; a jazzy call to action, it trumpets subtlety, imagination, generosity, life-force, to the rooftops.
∑ Trumpet is published as a Picador Classic.

Critics' Choice awards: Mad Max: Fury Road sweeps the ceremony; 
George Miller wins best director as film takes home nine trophies, boosting its chances at the Oscars where it will compete in 10 categories.

Staff and agencies.

Australian film-maker George Miller and the stars and crew from Mad Max: Fury Road have blazed their way through one of America's top awards shows. 
In a significant boost to the movie's Oscar chances, the fourth chapter in the Mad Max franchise swept nine categories at the Critics' Choice awards, including best director for Miller.

The film almost pulled off a clean sweep of the technical awards, adding momentum to the 10 Oscar nominations it received on Thursday.  
Mad Max: Fury Road collected Critics' Choice wins for production design, editing, costume design, hair and makeup, visual effects, best action movie, best actor in an action movie for Tom Hardy, and best actress in an action movie for Charlize Theron. 
Miller's win as best director helps his Oscar chances against Alejandro Gonz·lez IÒ·rritu, whose film The Revenant won three Golden Globes and 12 Oscar nominations last week. The Revenant suffered a hit at the Critics' Choice awards, nominated for nine awards but winning only two. 
The Revenant's star, Leonardo DiCaprio, claimed the Critics' Choice best actor award, confirming his Oscar frontrunner status, while Spotlight - about Boston Globe reporters uncovering a Catholic child molestation scandal - won best picture. The Critics' Choice awards often reflect which films will win big at the Academy awards, which will be held on 28 February.
This was the first year the Critics' Choice combined the awards for film and television into one ceremony. The full list of winners is below.

Tennis match-fixing reports: authorities 'absolutely reject' any cover-up; 
Reaction of sport's governing bodies to BBC and BuzzFeed reports at a hastily convened press conference in Melbourne is swift, considered and unequivocalJohn Whittingdale, Secretary of State for Sport: "These are serious allegations".

Kevin Mitchell in Melbourne.

Before a ball was struck, the 2016 Australian Open was pitched into a match-fixing scandal on Monday that pointed a shaky but accusatory finger at an unnamed grand slam winner and seven other players in the main draw who have been investigated for match-fixing or were under suspicion in the past decade.
Heavy hints of a cover-up are due to be aired on the BBC on Tuesday night UK time, after a long investigation in conjunction with BuzzFeed. If proved - which appears far from certain, in the absence of any identified players - the allegations would seriously damage the sport's image. Most disturbing is the possible involvement of a grand slam champion.

The BBC and BuzzFeed say they have been passed a "cache of documents" dating back to 2007 that expose "widespread suspected match-fixing at the top level of world tennis, including at Wimbledon. Over the past decade, 16 players who have ranked in the top 50 have been repeatedly flagged to the Tennis Integrity Unit over suspicions they have thrown matches."
The reaction of the various governing bodies at a hastily convened press conference at Melbourne Park on Monday morning was swift, considered and unequivocal.
"The Tennis Integrity Unit and the tennis authorities absolutely reject any suggestion that evidence of match-fixing has been suppressed for any reason or isn't being thoroughly investigated," said Chris Kermode, the chief executive of the Association of Tennis Professionals.
"And while the BBC and BuzzFeed reports mainly refer to events from about 10 years ago, we will investigate any new information, and we always do. In its investigations, the Tennis Integrity Unit [set up by the ATP to monitor betting patterns] has to find evidence, as opposed to information, suspicion or hearsay. This is the key here: that it requires evidence."
"It's obviously a matter of great concern," John Whittingdale ,  the  Secretary of State for sport, told Radio 4's Today programme on Monday. I hope that tennis will learn from other sports and investigate this very quickly and openly. These are serious allegations and they need to be looked into very quickly."
When it was suggested that the Tennis Integrity Unit had been negligent in investigating this in the past, Whittingdale responded: "That is how it appears. If it is correct that reports have been repeatedly made to the Integrity Unit which suggest that match fixing was taking place, and yet no action was taken, that in itself is very worrying and needs to be looked at as part of the overall investigation."
Kermode cited the match at Sopot in Poland in 2007 between the then world No 4 Nikolai Davydenko and Martin Vassallo Arguello, who was 87 in the world, which Arguello won when the Russian retired. Betfair, the world's largest online betting company, voided all bets on the match because of what it regarded as "irregular betting patterns".
Kermode observed: "A year-long investigation into the Solpot match in 2007 found insufficient evidence. As the BuzzFeed report states itself, the investigators hit a brick wall and it just wasn't possible to determine who the guilty party was in relation to this match. "All professional players, support staff and officials are subject to the tennis anti-corruption programme. Tennis Integrity Unit anti-corruption investigations have resulted in 18 convictions, of which six have had life bans."
However, nearly all have been minor names. 
The BBC-Buzzfeed inquiries allege: "The problem of suspicious betting and match-fixing is not going away. Eight of the players repeatedly flagged to the TIU over the past decade are due to play in the Australian Open."
Benn Gunn, a former police chief constable whose review of betting in tennis led to the TIU's creation, said: "If they were really serious about dealing with this, then they really need to create an integrity unit with teeth."
Mark Phillips, who was involved in the first investigation in 2007, has gone on the record for the first time, and told the BBC: "There was a core of about 10 players who we believed were the most common perpetrators that were at the root of the problem. Evidence that we gathered... we believed was very strong. There was a group of between six and 10 players, really, who were the main focus of the evidence that we dug up. 
"We believed they [the TIU] would carry on the investigations from where we had taken them; we had done a lot of work on the investigation and certainly the betting investigations were a long way down the road.
"As far as we know, nothing happened with the evidence that we presented. Certainly none of the players that we had concerns about faced disciplinary action from the TIU in the next year or two."
Kermode said on Monday: "All of us here in tennis are absolutely committed to stamping out any form of corrupt conduct in our sport. There is a zero tolerance policy on this. We are not complacent. We are very vigilant on this. We are aware that all sport - all sport, not just tennis - is at potential risk of corruption.
"That is why, in 2008 the Tennis Integrity Unit was set up to tackle this issue head on. We are constantly vigilant and not complacent. Tennis has invested over $14m to address this issue of corruption - and it's constantly being reviewed. I think that's the big message for today. This is not something that we are taking for granted."
As for problems in gathering evidence, the TIU chief, Nigel Willerton, said: "Under the tennis anti-corruption programme, we can demand [players'] phones and laptops and iPads. Obviously they have to consent to give them. However, if they don't then consent to give them, that's called non-cooperation, and they can be reported and sanctioned. There was a case recently when a player was sanctioned for a two-year suspension."

Asked about claims that eight players who have been tracked under suspicion are in the main draw in Melbourne, Willerton would say only: "It would be inappropriate for me to make comment as to whether any players are under investigation at the present time."
On the sensitive subject of sponsorship of tennis by betting outlets, such as BetPlay and William Hill, Kermode said, "I don't think it's an issue, because it can actually help at times. Nigel and the Tennis Integrity Unit are working with betting companies all the time to spot corruption. "The distinction to make is that betting itself is not an illegal pastime, and many people do bet on sport. What we are talking about is corruption. Sometimes we can talk about betting and corruption [as] the same thing, and they are different.
"It's in [bookmakers'] interest that there isn't corruption, right? They are as strong as we are that we are getting rid of corruption within the game." 
Tennis Australia chief executive and Australian Open tournament director, Craig Tiley, also rejected the suggestion that evidence of match-fixing had been suppressed.
"We have built an international reputation for the integrity of the tournament and the anti-corruption systems we have in place," Tiley said on Monday. "In conjunction with world tennis we have developed leading anti-doping, disciplinary, anti-corruption and security policies. All involved in the administration of the Australian Open will not tolerate any deviations from our values and rules at any level."
"Of course the deliberate timing of this story is far from ideal for our event," Tiley said. "But the important issue here is that we stamp out any form of corruption in tennis. That's why, many years ago, Tennis Australia pushed hard for an all-sport response to this issue. Stamping out any form of corruption requires a continued focus on prevention, education and investigation."

In its investigations, the Tennis Integrity Unit [set up by the ATP to monitor betting patterns] has to find evidence, as opposed to information, suspicion or hearsay. This is the key here: that it requires evidence."
Kermode cited the match at Sopot in Poland in 2007 between the then world No 4 Nikolai Davydenko and Martin Vassallo Arguello, who was 87 in the world, which Arguello won when the Russian retired. Betfair, the world's largest online betting company, voided all bets on the match because of what it regarded as "irregular betting patterns".
Kermode observed: "A year-long investigation into the Solpot match in 2007 found insufficient evidence. As the BuzzFeed report states itself, the investigators hit a brick wall and it just wasn't possible to determine who the guilty party was in relation to this match. "All professional players, support staff and officials are subject to the tennis anti-corruption programme. Tennis Integrity Unit anti-corruption investigations have resulted in 18 convictions, of which six have had life bans."
However, nearly all have been minor names. 
The BBC-Buzzfeed inquiries allege: "The problem of suspicious betting and match-fixing is not going away. Eight of the players repeatedly flagged to the TIU over the past decade are due to play in the Australian Open."
Benn Gunn, a former police chief constable whose review of betting in tennis led to the TIU's creation, said: "If they were really serious about dealing with this, then they really need to create an integrity unit with teeth."
Mark Phillips, who was involved in the first investigation in 2007, has gone on the record for the first time, and told the BBC: "There was a core of about 10 players who we believed were the most common perpetrators that were at the root of the problem. Evidence that we gathered... we believed was very strong. There was a group of between six and 10 players, really, who were the main focus of the evidence that we dug up. 
"We believed they [the TIU] would carry on the investigations from where we had taken them; we had done a lot of work on the investigation and certainly the betting investigations were a long way down the road.
"As far as we know, nothing happened with the evidence that we presented. Certainly none of the players that we had concerns about faced disciplinary action from the TIU in the next year or two."
Kermode said on Monday: "All of us here in tennis are absolutely committed to stamping out any form of corrupt conduct in our sport. There is a zero tolerance policy on this. We are not complacent. We are very vigilant on this. We are aware that all sport - all sport, not just tennis - is at potential risk of corruption.
"That is why, in 2008 the Tennis Integrity Unit was set up to tackle this issue head on. We are constantly vigilant and not complacent. Tennis has invested over $14m to address this issue of corruption - and it's constantly being reviewed. I think that's the big message for today. This is not something that we are taking for granted."
As for problems in gathering evidence, the TIU chief, Nigel Willerton, said: "Under the tennis anti-corruption programme, we can demand [players'] phones and laptops and iPads. Obviously they have to consent to give them. However, if they don't then consent to give them, that's called non-cooperation, and they can be reported and sanctioned. There was a case recently when a player was sanctioned for a two-year suspension."
 Related:  Organised crime has already infiltrated tennis, says security expert
Asked about claims that eight players who have been tracked under suspicion are in the main draw in Melbourne, Willerton would say only: "It would be inappropriate for me to make comment as to whether any players are under investigation at the present time."
On the sensitive subject of sponsorship of tennis by betting outlets, such as BetPlay and William Hill, Kermode said, "I don't think it's an issue, because it can actually help at times. Nigel and the Tennis Integrity Unit are working with betting companies all the time to spot corruption. "The distinction to make is that betting itself is not an illegal pastime, and many people do bet on sport. What we are talking about is corruption. Sometimes we can talk about betting and corruption [as] the same thing, and they are different.
"It's in [bookmakers'] interest that there isn't corruption, right? They are as strong as we are that we are getting rid of corruption within the game." 
Tennis Australia chief executive and Australian Open tournament director, Craig Tiley, also rejected the suggestion that evidence of match-fixing had been suppressed.
"We have built an international reputation for the integrity of the tournament and the anti-corruption systems we have in place," Tiley said on Monday. "In conjunction with world tennis we have developed leading anti-doping, disciplinary, anti-corruption and security policies. All involved in the administration of the Australian Open will not tolerate any deviations from our values and rules at any level."
"Of course the deliberate timing of this story is far from ideal for our event," Tiley said. "But the important issue here is that we stamp out any form of corruption in tennis. That's why, many years ago, Tennis Australia pushed hard for an all-sport response to this issue. Stamping out any form of corruption requires a continued focus on prevention, education and investigation."

Why my philosophy students will be working together for a change; 
Teamwork doesn't suit everyone, but collaborating with others at university is a rehearsal for working life.

Jonathan Wolff.

I'm introducing an experimental module this term. Philosophy students will be put into small groups. Their task will be to produce a collective report on a burning public issue. Should we permit assisted dying? What should we do about climate change? That sort of thing. They'll have a term to solve the world's thorniest problems.
What, you may ask, is so special about this? Isn't group work at the heart of the educational experience, even from nursery school? 
Actually, it isn't. Some years ago it was all the rage to talk about the "personal transferable skills" a university education should provide in the fast-moving, fluid and flexible new world of work. Dreading the exercise, we took an audit of our philosophy curriculum to see how we did. Numeracy? Thank heaven for compulsory first-year logic. Reasoning skills? You bet! Self-awareness and self-criticism? Hmm ... maybe a bit too much. Teamwork? Let me get back to you on that.
Whatever people say on their research grant applications, work in the arts and humanities remains largely the product of the sole researcher. We are not all "lone scholars" - many of my colleagues will give you a nod when you pass in the corridor - but when it comes to publication, single authorship is by far the norm.
How many major history books can you think of by joint authors? Biographies? Works of literary criticism? OK, there was Ogden and Richards' The Meaning of Meaning in 1923. And Strunk and White's The Elements of Style. But the fact that Strunk died in 1946 and White didn't start working on the edition that bears his name until the 50s rather makes my point.
While joint authorship is the rule in science and, increasingly, social science, it remains a rarity in the humanities. Cooperation is more likely through conferences and workshops, editing of collected volumes or journal special issues, or commenting on unfinished drafts.
Here conventions differ tremendously. I've been surprised to find myself listed as a co-author on a draft social science paper when all I did was send quick comments that would barely have merited an acknowledgment in a footnote in a philosophy paper.
Why is it that the arts and humanities have been so resistant to team authorship? Is the cult of originality so ingrained and unshakeable? It is true that one's ego gets submerged when writing with another person, which, I confess, is something that I have done from time to time and enjoy. In some cases, eventually, neither author can remember who had which idea first. Or rather, perhaps we both think the good ones were ours and rotten ones the other person's.
 Related:  Beware, the central control that grips schools is heading universities' way
What about student teamwork? Of course students get a stern warning about plagiarism, and every now and again a scandal breaks out about mass copying in an elite American university (though why it should be an international news story is hard to fathom). But we do strongly encourage students to discuss their work and ideas. Friends may exchange drafts for comments. They make editing suggestions and suggest better examples or an improved formulation of a crucial point. Nevertheless, we implicitly assume there is a line that must not be crossed if the essay is to count as the students' own work, even though we can't quite say where that line is.
Well, in my new class students will be working without a line. They all need to muck in to produce their report, and much of their final grade will depend on other students' efforts, although there will be individual assignments too.
Some students who had been interested in the class decided not to take it when they realised their grade would partly be based on the work of others. That's understandable. Still, for most people this course is simply a rehearsal for working life. If you can't work in a team you'd better be brilliant, already rich, or not worried about being poor. Or an academic in the arts and humanities.

Weak EU tests for diesel emissions are 'illegal', say lawyers; 
Loopholes in planned 'real world' tests allow cars to emit double the standard for NOx pollution and are 'legally indefensible' say MEPs, after new advice revealed.

Arthur Neslen, Brussels.

Planned new 'real driving emissions' (RDE) test limits that would let cars substantially breach nitrogen oxide (NOx) standards are illegal under EU law, according to new legal analysis seen by the Guardian.
The proposed 'Euro 6' tests would allow diesel cars to emit more than double the bloc's '80 mg per km' standard for NOx emissions from 2019, and more than 50% above it indefinitely from 2021.
The UK supported these exemptions. But they contradict the regulation's core objective of progressively scaling down emissions and improving air quality, according to an opinion by the European Parliament's legal services, which the Guardian has seen. 
In principle, the exemptions and loopholes "run counter [to] the aims and content of the basic regulation as expressed by the Euro 6 limit values," says the informal paper prepared for MEPs on the parliament's environment committee.
"The commission has taken a political decision to favour the commercial interests of car manufacturers over the protection of the health of European citizens," adds a second analysis by the environmental law firm ClientEarth, also seen by the Guardian. 
"The decision is therefore illegal and should be vetoed by the European Parliament," the ClientEarth advice says.
Catherine Bearder, a Liberal Democrat MEP on the environment committee, told the Guardian that as well as being morally unjustifiable, the agreement to water down the emissions limits was now "legally indefensible".
"This was a political decision, not a technical one, and so it should have been subject to proper democratic accountability," she told the Guardian. "MEPs must veto this shameful stitch-up and demand a stronger proposal, based on the evidence and not on pressure from the car industry."
Richard Burden, the shadow transport minister, who pressed the government over its support for the new limits in October, accused them of a lack of leadership now. 
"It really is not good enough," he told the Guardian. "The pressure must be kept up for continuous improvements in emissions performance after 2020, as well as before, and the regulation which the EU adopts should reflect this."
The two legal papers were prepared ahead of a plenary vote of all MEPs in Strasbourg that had been expected to block the legislation next week. 
But on Thursday that vote was postponed until February, amid widespread industry lobbying and accusations of "political chicanery" by Green Party MEPs.
Rebecca Harms, the Greens co-president said that the postponement represented "a coup against the EU's democratic decision-making" that would seriously damage its regulatory credibility after the " dieselgate " scandal.
Shares in the French car company Renault plunged by up to 20% yesterday on separate news that fraud investigators had searched three company sites and seized computers, as a national probe continues into whether other car companies have used VW-style 'defeat devices'.
The auto industry has been pushing back strongly against regulatory pressure in Brussels though, calling for a speedy approval of the RDE package because "the industry urgently needs clarity".
Firms say that 'conformity factor' exemptions, allowing 50% more NOx to be emitted than standards should permit, compensates for potential margins of error in testing. 
 Related:  Wide range of cars emit more pollution in realistic driving tests, data shows
The Guardian has seen an email to an MEP on the environment committee from an industry lobbyist arguing that blocking the Euro 6 package "would lead to a significant delay in the implementation of the RDE procedure, possibly by as much as one to two years".
 "We believe this is not in the interest of improving air quality and would undermine long-term planning in the industry," said Amalia Di Stefano, the deputy CEO of the European Association of Automotive Suppliers.
The environment committee had called on the commission to present an improved proposal by April, although its ability to do so would depend on flexibility from countries with powerful auto industries, such as Germany.
Leading figures in the centre-right EPP and centre-left S&D blocs, if not all their MEPs, appear to have gambled on a compromise with the European commission before February's plenary vote. Brussels is due to bring forward separate proposals on 27 January, for the reform and regulation of national auto-emissions testing regimes.
Every year, around 23,500 Britons die prematurely from inhaling NOx emissions such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) particles, emitted by diesel engines. Another 29,000 die from inhaling sooty particulate matter, which by both diesel and petrol engines.
"Beyond corporate misconduct, premature deaths and quality of European lives are at stake in this decision," said Julia Poliscanova, clean vehicles and air quality officer for the Transport & Environment thinktank. "The commission and the environment ministers of the 28 countries should think twice before granting carmakers a licence to pollute."

Tennis match-fixing claims: authorities 'absolutely reject' any cover-up; 
Reaction of sport's governing bodies to BBC and BuzzFeed reports at a hastily convened press conference in Melbourne is swift, considered and unequivocal.

Kevin Mitchell.

Before a ball was struck, the 2016 Australian Open was pitched into a match-fixing scandal on Monday that pointed a shaky but accusatory finger at an unnamed grand slam winner and seven other players in the main draw who have been investigated for match-fixing or were under suspicion in the past decade.
Heavy hints of a cover-up are due to be aired on the BBC on Tuesday night UK time, after a long investigation in conjunction with BuzzFeed. If proved - which appears far from certain, in the absence of any identified players - the allegations would seriously damage the sport's image. Most disturbing is the possible involvement of a grand slam champion. 
 Related:  Tennis match-fixing claims: eight players in Australian Open draw suspected
The BBC and BuzzFeed say they have been passed a "cache of documents" dating back to 2007 that expose "widespread suspected match-fixing at the top level of world tennis, including at Wimbledon. Over the past decade, 16 players who have ranked in the top 50 have been repeatedly flagged to the Tennis Integrity Unit over suspicions they have thrown matches."
The reaction of the various governing bodies at a hastily convened press conference at Melbourne Park on Monday morning was swift, considered and unequivocal.
"The Tennis Integrity Unit and the tennis authorities absolutely reject any suggestion that evidence of match-fixing has been suppressed for any reason or isn't being thoroughly investigated," said Chris Kermode, the chief executive of the Association of Tennis Professionals.
"And while the BBC and BuzzFeed reports mainly refer to events from about 10 years ago, we will investigate any new information, and we always do.

Honduras president announces international body to tackle corruption; 
Juan Orlando Hern·ndez has agreed to an OAS-backed mission similar to one under UN auspices which led to the downfall of the president of Guatemala.

Nina Lakhani in Mexico City.

Honduras's president, Juan Orlando Hern·ndez, has announced the launch of a new international anti-corruption body to tackle criminal networks within the country's political and judicial systems, in an attempt to appease anger over impunity and graft. 
The Mission to Support the Fight against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (Maccih) will have powers to independently investigate politicians, judges and members of the security forces. Organised crime's infiltration of weak and corrupt state institutions has helped make Honduras one of the poorest and most violent countries in the region. 
Maccih will be led by the former Peruvian prime minister Juan JimÈnez and is backed by the Organisation of American States (OAS), with an initial mandate of four years.
 Related:  How hitmen and high living lifted lid on looting of Honduran healthcare system
The move comes after a wave of public fury last summer when Hern·ndez was forced to admit that his 2013 election campaign had benefited from $300m stolen from the country's social security institute. By some estimates the fraud left thousands dead as a result of medical shortages and the health service in ruins. 
The scandal triggered a wave of protests as students, middle-class families, civil society groups and the political opposition united to demand an end to endemic corruption and impunity, and the resignation of the president. 
The protests were buoyed by a parallel uprising in neighbouring Guatemala where the discovery by an independent UN-backed anti-corruption institution (Cicig) of a vast corruption network in the country's customs system brought down the president and vice-president. 
The Honduran social movement morphed into the Indignados - the Outraged - who have been demanding a similar UN-backed institution capable and willing to tackle corrupt officials at the highest level. 
In an attempt to placate tensions, Hern·ndez initially proposed Maccih with a narrow mandate to make recommendations on how to root out corruption - an exercise attempted several times in the past, according to Eric Olson, associate director of the Latin American program at the Woodrow Wilson Center. 
But amid pressure from campaigners at home and the US Congress - which was debating a $750m aid package for Central America known as the Alliance for Prosperity - Orlando was forced to concede greater powers to Maccih. 
The beefed-up body will have unfettered access to official documents and archives, and powers to investigate any corruption case. It will develop an observatory with civil society to monitor progress of the judicial system. 
Olson said: "While Maccih still isn't perfect, it has a tremendous opportunity to make an impact in Honduras like Cicig in Guatemala. It's incumbent on its jurists to go wherever the evidence leads them, even if it takes them to the highest levels of the Honduras government."
Despite the improvements, many doubts remain. 
"It's largely for show, isn't designed to be as powerful as Cicig, and many are dubious about the OAS, which was feckless in the aftermath of the 2009 coup," said Christine Wade, associate professor of political science and international studies at Washington College. 
It remains unclear how Maccih will work with the attorney general's office, which itself has made important strides in dismantling corrupt criminal networks involving the country's powerful political and business elites.
Steven Dudley, co-director of InSight Crime, said: "There are many, many signs that the [Honduran] attorney general's office is doing its job better all the time. This is the time to support that office, not undermine it with outside entities."
It took several years and three leaders before Cicig claimed the victories that gave it the kudos and respect it now commands. 
But it seems unlikely that Honduras will be so patient. 
Ariel Varela, spokesman for the Indignados, told the Guardian: "If Maccih is good enough, then six months is enough time to provide strong signals that it is here investigating corruption at the highest level and not just another international bureaucratic institution helping the government calm social tensions. If it doesn't, we'll be ready to mobilise on the streets and force the OAS out."

Terrorism Act incompatible with human rights, court rules in David Miranda case; 
Appeal court says detention of Miranda was lawful but clause under which he was held is incompatible with European human rights convention.

Owen Bowcott Legal affairs correspondent.

A key clause in the Terrorism Act 2000 is incompatible with the European convention on human rights, the master of the rolls, John Dyson, has said as part of a court of appeal judgment.
The decision came in the case of David Miranda, who was detained at Heathrow airport in 2013 for carrying files related to information obtained by the US whistleblower Edward Snowden.
The court of appeal's judgment on Tuesday will force government ministers to re-examine the act. 
Lord Dyson, who made the ruling with Lord Justice Richards and Lord Justice Floyd, said the powers contained in schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 were flawed. It allows travellers to be questioned to find out whether they appear to be terrorists. They have no right to remain silent or receive legal advice and they may be detained for up to six hours. 
 Related:  David Miranda ruling throws new light on schedule 7 powers
"The stop power, if used in respect of journalistic information or material, is incompatible with article 10 [freedom of expression] of the [European convention on human rights] because it is not 'prescribed by law'," said Dyson, the most senior civil judge in England and Wales.
The judgment continued: "If journalists and their sources can have no expectation of confidentiality, they may decide against providing information on sensitive matters of public interest."
The ruling rejects the broad definition of terrorism advanced by government lawyers. The correct legal definition of terrorism, the court of appeal has now determined, requires some intent to cause a serious threat to public safety such as endangering life.
The judges concluded, however, that the police decision to detain Miranda, the partner of the former Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, at Heathrow was lawful. 
In response to the ruling, the Home Office said: "We have always been clear that David Miranda's examination by police under schedule 7 was lawful and proportionate. The court of appeal's judgment in this case supports the action taken by police to protect national security.
"We also note the court's decision that schedule 7, as in force at the time of this incident, did not provide sufficient protection against the examination of journalistic material." 
Kate Goold, of the law firm Bindmans who represented Miranda, said: "The notion of a journalist becoming an accidental terrorist has been wholeheartedly rejected. We welcome this court's principled and decisive ruling that schedule 7 needs to come in line with other legislation to ensure that the seizure of journalistic material is protected by judicial safeguards."
Greenwald welcomed the judgment on Twitter: 
In the judgment, Dyson said the police's power to stop people at ports and airports was not subject to "sufficient legal safeguards to avoid the risk that it will be exercised arbitrarily. The court therefore grants a certificate of incompatibility".
He said: "It will be a matter for parliament to decide how to provide such a safeguard. The most obvious safeguard would be some form of judicial or other independent and impartial scrutiny in such a way as to protect the confidentiality in the material."
Issuing a certificate of incompatibility is highly unusual, but an option for judges when they conclude that UK law is inconsistent with the country's international human rights obligations.
The judgment in effect says the police acted within the existing law, but the law itself needs to be altered.
"The exercise of the schedule 7 stop power in relation to Mr Miranda on 18 August 2013 was lawful," the judges concluded. "But the stop power conferred by paragraph 2(1) of schedule 7 is incompatible with article 10 of the convention in relation to journalistic material in that it was not subject to adequate safeguards against its arbitrary exercise."
The judgment said: "The central concern is that disclosure of journalistic material [whether or not it involves the identification of a journalist's sources] undermines the confidentiality that is inherent in such material and which is necessary to avoid the chilling effect of disclosure and to protect article 10 [freedom of expression] rights." 
The challenge brought by Miranda questioned the legality of his nine-hour detention under counter-terrorism powers. 
The hearing at the court of appeal in London in December followed an earlier decision by a lower court that holding him was lawful.
About 60,000 people a year are held in such controversial port stops. The Home Office has argued that border controls exist to check on travellers when there is insufficient information to justify an arrest.
The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Alistair Carmichael MP, said: "The Terrorism Act should be used in dealing with terrorists, not for journalists or whistleblowers. The ruling recognises the important role journalists play in holding government to account and shining a light on a range of issues." 
The human rights group Liberty welcomed what it described as a "landmark judgment". Rosie Brighouse, its legal officer, said: "This judgment is a major victory for the free press. Schedule 7 has been a blot on our legal landscape for years - breathtakingly broad and intrusive, ripe for discrimination, routinely misused. Its repeal is long overdue.
"It is also a timely reminder of how crucial the Human Rights Act is for protecting journalists' rights. Once again it has come to the rescue of press freedom in the face of arbitrary abuse of power by the state."
Free speech organisations English Pen, Article 19 and the Media Legal Defence Initiative had all intervened to support the appeal. Jo Glanville, English Pen's director, said: "While it is disappointing that the appeal was not successful on all grounds, this is a significant victory for press freedom, remedying a very worrying gap in the law for safeguarding journalistic material and sources." 
Nani Jansen, the legal director of the Media Legal Defence Initiative, said: "The seizure of journalistic data under broadly defined counter-terrorism legislation is a serious affront to media freedom, and is undoubtedly a cause of concern for investigative journalists across the globe."
David Banisar, a legal counsel for Article 19, said: "With the investigatory powers bill now going through the parliamentary scrutiny process on a rushed timetable, this judgment serves as an argument for even greater scrutiny and a thorough review of powers which could have dramatic implications for freedom of expression in the UK."
Miranda's first legal challenge was supported by the Guardian. The court of appeal challenge was funded by First Look Media, which publishes the online magazine the Intercept. The organisation said the appeal had been brought to defend freedom of expression and journalists' rights.
Rachel Logan, Amnesty UK's legal programme director, said: "This case is about whether journalists are free to go about their work in Britain without interference dressed up as security."
A Guardian News & Media spokesperson said: "This is a victory not only for David Miranda, but for the principles of a free press and journalism in the public interest. Today's verdict makes clear that journalism cannot be equated with terrorism, and we're pleased that the court has highlighted that the extent of these powers should now be reviewed." 
 Related:  Surveillance laws are being rewritten post-Snowden, but what will really change?
When Miranda was stopped, he was carrying encrypted files containing journalistic material derived from Snowden, the US National Security Agency whistleblower. His counsel, Matthew Ryder QC, told the court: "Snowden, whatever you may think of him, provided information which has been of immense public importance. In this case we are talking about journalism of unusually high quality."
Three high court judges dismissed the initial challenge in 2014, accepting that Miranda's detention and the seizure of computer material was "an indirect interference with press freedom" but justified by legitimate and "very pressing" interests of national security.
Miranda was stopped in transit between Berlin and Rio de Janeiro after meeting the film-maker Laura Poitras, who had been involved in making disclosures based on documents Snowden leaked.
Miranda was carrying encrypted files, including an external hard drive containing 58,000 highly classified UK intelligence documents "in order to assist the journalistic activity of Greenwald". 
The Guardian made his travel reservations and paid for the trip. The high court judgment said the seized material included personal information that would allow security staff to be identified, including those deployed overseas.

Teach about sex abuse from start of primary school, says shadow minister; 
Sarah Champion says teaching children how to protect themselves from predators is the best way of preventing abuse.

Rowena Mason Political correspondent.

Children should be taught how to keep themselves safe from sexual abuse from the age of four or five, with compulsory lessons in their first year of primary school, a shadow Home Office minister has said.
Sarah Champion, a leading campaigner against sexual exploitation in her Rotherham constituency, said teaching children how to protect themselves from predators was the most important way of preventing abuse.
The Labour MP made the proposal as she launched a new website called Dare2Care, which aims to provide advice on stopping child abuse and recognising the signs. 
Champion said she wanted to persuade the government that there should be compulsory primary education about the "underwear rule", devised by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC).
This tells children to remember the mnemonic "pants" in which P stands for "privates are private", A for "always remember your body belongs to you", N for "no means no", T for "talk about secrets that upset them" and S for "speak up because someone can help".
Champion said: "With even the best legislation we put in place you cannot protect a child 24/7, whereas from a very young age, I would advocate as soon as they go to school, if you teach young children about respect and boundaries they can understand that. 
"You are not teaching them about sex. It is teaching children what's in their pants is private to them and if anyone tells you otherwise, you need to tell someone about it. If your uncle is telling you he is doing this because he loves you and it is your little secret, how are you as a six-year-old meant to know that is not appropriate behaviour? 
"But if you had an example in school that what's inside your pants is yours, you might tell your mum. It should happen in every school, as soon as you go into school."
To those who think the start of primary school is too young, she said: "I think there have now been four chairs of parliamentary committees asking the government to make relationship education rather than just the biology of sex education statutory. The pressure is on them enormously.
"If we want to protect our children, we have to stop being embarrassed about sex and be grown up and give them the tools to counter it. Across the country now, police forces are taking their resources and prioritising investigating child abuse. The evidence is you cannot ignore this any more."
She points to NSPCC figures that suggest 500,000 children are being physically, sexually or emotionally abused, and highlights research suggesting that one in four girls and one in eight boys have experienced inappropriate sexual advances by the time they reach adulthood. 
Sex education is compulsory from the age of 11 in council-maintained schools, while academies and free schools are asked to have regard for the guidance. 
Before the election, Labour called for "age-appropriate" teaching about sex and relationships to be compulsory in all state schools, but the government is not keen to change the rules.
Before children reach primary school age, Champion also wants to teach their parents to spot the signs of abuse, given that two-thirds happens within the family. 
This could potentially happen as part of David Cameron's proposed parenting classes, she said.
"Child abuse exists in the shadows so as long as we're embarrassed that will continue. I really do believe, if we can take it out of the shadows, if we can arm the children, educate the parents, we have got a much better chance of preventing it because it is not inevitable," she said.
Champion became a campaigner against child abuse after becoming MP for Rotherham, where gangs of men groomed and sexually exploited an estimated 1,400 children.
Simon Bailey, the lead officer on child abuse at the Association of Chief Police Officers, subsequently said more scandals like that in Rotherham were likely to emerge.

Jailed Turkish editor slams EU deal with Erdogan's 'fascist government'; 
Can D¸ndar, held for his story alleging Turkey armed Islamist rebels in Syria, says EU is betraying its democratic values.

Kareem Shaheen in Beirut.

The editor of Turkey's most influential dissident newspaper has said in an interview from his prison cell that the country's ongoing crackdown on journalists is the worst in its history and that he was imprisoned for doing his job.
Can D¸ndar, the editor-in-chief of Cumhuriyet, also said the EU was betraying its democratic values by seeking a rapprochement with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in the hope that he would stem the flow of refugees into Europe while ignoring human rights violations. 
"We always looked at the European Union as an anchor, a model to raise the standard of democracy in Turkey to universal levels, not as leverage to dictatorships," he said. "Now, if the EU, in order to stop the influx of refugees by turning our lands into a big concentration camp, agrees to turn a blind eye while Erdogan spurns democracy, human rights, freedom of press and rule of law, it means that the EU is discarding its founding principles in order to protect its short-term interests." 
                     D¸ndar was arrested in November along with his newspaper's bureau chief in Ankara, Erdem G¸l, and charged with espionage and divulging state secrets over a story published six months earlier which alleged that the Turkish intelligence service, MIT, was sending weapons to rebels fighting Bashar al-Assad in Syria under the guise of humanitarian aid.

His arrest came just days after the Islamist Justice and Development Party (AKP), which Erdogan founded and led before his election as president, secured a sweeping majority in parliamentary polls.
Turkey faces a growing threat from Islamic State, which has carried out a series of attacks in the country, and a simmering insurgency in Kurdish areas. It is also hosting more than 2 million Syrian refugees, tens of thousands of whom have attempted to flee to Europe by boat.
Fourteen journalists were in prison in Turkey in 2015, making it the fifth worst offender in the Committee to Protect Journalists' media census. Erdogan has also attacked foreign intellectuals and writers for criticising his government, saying they should stand with him against terrorism.

The interview with D¸ndar was arranged through his lawyers, who provided him with the questions. He wrote his answers by hand in his cell in solitary confinement and the Guardian was provided with translations of his responses and scans of the Turkish originals.
D¸ndar was kept in isolation for 40 days, before being moved to a shared cell. While in solitary, he was only allowed an hour a week to receive visitors. He is not allowed a typewriter or computer, and spends most of his day reading memoirs of those who wrote while incarcerated.
D¸ndar said he and his lawyers had not been provided with an indictment outlining the formal charges against him, and that there was a confidentiality order on the case which prevented his lawyers from examining it.
"What case? That is the real problem," he said. "We have been in prison for 45 days, under conditions fit for a serial killer, yet we still don't know our charges."
He does know the contents of the complaint Erdogan filed and the court statement justifying his imprisonment. The complaint calls for two life sentences for alleged espionage and "divulging state secrets".
He said: "Delaying the bill of indictment is a tactic frequently used by the Turkish judicial system in order to punish the detainee in advance." 
D¸ndar said the facts of the case indicated that he had been imprisoned for doing his job as a journalist, and that prosecutors had only asked him about his phone number, why he wrote the story and who leaked the information to him. 
"The sole 'proof' they have is my story printed in the newspaper," he said. "So basically I am being charged with espionage because I printed a news story ... in the newspaper." 
D¸ndar said the increasing number of prosecutions against journalists in Turkey was an attempt to intimidate the country's press.
"There is always a positive correlation between the increase of criminal activity of the government and the number of imprisoned journalists," he said. "So is the case this time. As the number of dirty affairs, corruption, unlawful arms trades and extrajudicial killings go up, the journalists who write or that have the potential to write about these deeds become targets. Their imprisonment is an intimidation to the other journalists. Throw one in [jail] and silence 100."
The campaign and pressure against him came directly from Erdogan, he claimed.
"Two days after the news story about the trucks carrying weapons to radical Islamist groups came out, the president said: 'He will pay a heavy price for this. I won't let him go unpunished.' On the same day, journalists who are close to the president went on air and took it to the next level and said: 'If this happened in the United States, the CIA would kill the person who wrote it and make it look like an accident.' Some see my imprisonment as a blessing, considering all the other possibilities. 
"All day long the Turkish courts handle the lawsuits which he filed against journalists who 'insulted' him. He takes every criticism as a personal insult. There isn't a single journalist in Turkey who exposes a scandal surrounding the government and expects 'to get away with it'." 
D¸ndar also said Erdogan had grown increasingly authoritarian, citing his crackdown on pro-Kurdish political parties, his backing for the AKP in recent parliamentary elections despite his presumed neutrality as a president, and attempts to co-opt police forces and the judiciary.
"He consolidated absolute power by establishing a police force of epic proportions and came in total control of the judiciary system," D¸ndar said. 
He also criticised the rapprochement between Erdogan and the EU, which is hoping that the Turkish leader will act to stem the flow of refugees fleeing to Europe by sea. In November, t he EU agreed a (EURO)3bn aid package for Syrian refugees with Turkey, widely seen as an attempt to push Ankara to crack down on the influx of refugees into Europe via the Mediterranean.
"If the west, in a bid to shut off its doors to the people escaping the fire that it has partially fuelled, turns a blind eye to a fascist government; it will drown, along with the refugees, its own values and principles and those who believe in them," he said.

How Coronation Street handled revenge porn; 
A storyline involving naked photos of Corrie's Steph Britton taken by an old boyfriend and leaked online is topical and educational.

Frances Ryan.

It might not be what you'd expect from a soap that first aired in 1960, but credit to Coronation Street for tackling one of the most modern of crimes. In a storyline that's set to finish this week (warning: spoilers), viewers have watched bistro waitress Steph Britton become the victim of revenge pornography - when her ex-boyfriend, Jamie Bowman (played with suitably shifty creepiness by James Atherton), leaked naked photos of her online. 
At times, the writers' handling of the issue hasn't shown the cobbles to be  a bastion of feminism. (Granted, the fact that Corrie factory boss Carla got divorced and inexplicably reverted to her previous ex-husband's surname instead of her own suggests  this may have been too much to ask.)  
It says plenty that Jamie only threatened to leak the photos of Steph as a way to blackmail her brother, Luke. Meanwhile, Steph's boyfriend, Andy, reacted to learning about his girlfriend's ordeal with the sort of wounded male pride typically saved for a 10-year-old who has had his favourite toy stolen. 
Luke and Andy - characters who shouldn't be trusted with a hamster, let alone a criminal investigation - have spent the past couple of weeks embodying two disgruntled white knights,  defending Steph's honour all the way to Manchester city centre. They've exposed Jamie's awful actions to his girlfriend, as well as his boss. 
Luckily, producers have remembered to also put the focus on Steph (played ably by the otherwise underused Tish Merry). We've seen her paranoia at men laughing at their phones and her anger at Facebook friends commenting with faux sympathy under the explicit photos. The recent scene in which she shared her feelings of humiliation and self-blame with  boss Leanne Battersby - a character previously coerced into prostitution - was brilliantly done, and prompted Steph to report the crime to the police. 
This seems crucial. Revenge porn has hit the headlines over the past few years through high-profile cases such as ex-X Factor singer Tulisa Contostavlos's ex-boyfriend Justin Edwards, but was only made a specific criminal offence in April 2015. It wouldn't be a surprise if the moment when Jamie was arrested was the first time many viewers thought about the reality of revenge porn, or knew that it is now punishable by up to two years in prison. 
The discussion of a current issue - let alone a feminist one - can feel tacked-on in soaps, as if producers are flitting between titillation and teaching. After all, this week's other major Coronation Street storyline is the dead body that happens to be entombed under Gail Platt's bedroom annex. But it's hard to dismiss the educational power of soap operas. You only have to look to UK television's first gay kiss, on EastEnders - or in recent years the Masood family's depiction of Islam or Emmerdale's portrayal of older women at risk of HIV - to appreciate the impact a revenge porn storyline could have.
Merry has said she hopes her character's plight will help keep girls safe by encouraging them to " think twice about taking " intimate photos. As viewers wait to watch Jamie get his comeuppance, I can't help but hope, rather, that the greatest impact the story will have will be on making cruel exes think twice about sharing them. 
The best message will be for a guilt-free to Steph to get her fun and confidence back. Oh - and to throw a pint over Andy in the Rovers.

Thami Tsolekile named in South African cricket match-fixing investigation; 
∑ Former Test wicketkeeper alleged to have been paid in Ram Slam T20 scandal ∑ Highveld Lions captain has played three Tests for South Africa.

Ali Martin and Luke Alfred in Johannesburg and Tristan Holme in Cape Town.

The former Test wicketkeeper Thami Tsolekile has been revealed as one of the players under investigation in the Twenty20 corruption scandal that has rocked South African cricket.
The Guardian has learned Tsolekile, who played the last of his three Tests for South Africa 12 years ago but has been in their squad as recently as March 2014, is alleged to have been paid at least R75,000 (£3,100) to improperly influence an aspect of last year's Ram Slam competition.
Tsolekile captained the Highveld Lions in the tournament and, according to Cricket South Africa's anti-corruption code, could face a minimum five-year ban if found guilty of wrongdoing.

Players can also be criminally charged under the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act, which contains a clause for sporting events. The law was passed in 2004, four years after the former South Africa captain Hansie Cronje received a life ban from cricket for match-fixing.
At least one more former South Africa player is believed to be under investigation, while a number of domestic cricketers are facing possible charges of failing to report approaches.
Last week the former South Africa one-day all-rounder Gulam Bodi was named as the "intermediary" charged by Cricket South Africa in December for allegedly attempting to recruit players for the Ram Slam T20 scam.
Bodi, who is cooperating with the investigation, played two one-day internationals and a Twenty20 for South Africa in 2007. His last professional game was in January last year, when he played alongside Tsolekile for the Lions.
Tsolekile has not played for the Lions since the Ram Slam tournament last month, missing four matches in the domestic first-class competition including last week's fixture with the Knights in Kimberley. The 35-year-old, whose Lions team finished second from bottom of the six-team Ram Slam competition, has captained South Africa A and the country's under-19 team.
When contacted by the Guardian, Tsolekile said: "No I don't know anything about that. And I don't want to comment anything about that."
A spokesperson for Cricket South Africa declined to comment while the investigation is continuing.
It has been established Bodi began to make overtures to players during the Africa T20 Cup, a season curtain-raiser played between 4 September and 4 October designed to give exposure to South Africa's semi-professional players.
During that time Bodi approached a player from the Titans franchise who rejected his offer but who is now under investigation for failing to report his advances.
Similar to the manner in which Cronje operated in the late 1990s, Bodi is understood to have pretended his offer was a joke once it had been rejected by the player.
South Africa's cricketers receive regular education on anti-corruption and were given a stark reminder of the pitfalls of fixing in early November, during the early stages of the Ram Slam tournament.
As part of a joint initiative between the South African Cricketers' Association and the Professional Cricketers' Association in England, players from the six franchises were given a presentation and had a Q&A session with the convicted spot-fixer Mervyn Westfield.
The former Essex fast bowler served eight weeks of a four-month jail sentence and was banned from professional cricket for five years for accepting an offer of £6,000 to deliberately bowl badly in a Pro40 game against Durham in September 2009.
Westfield was also banned from participating in club cricket for three years, although that was reduced after he agreed to assist in a PCA-run anti-corruption programme.
At the same meetings that Westfield told the South African players his story, it is understood the CSA anti-corruption chief, Louis Cole, informed the players that suspicious characters had already been spotted at televised matches.
Twenty-two of the 32 games in the Ram Slam T20 were broadcast overseas, including in India.
On 6 November, four games into the tournament, a CSA press release said the organisation had warned players "after gathering intelligence that an international syndicate is attempting to corrupt domestic cricket in South Africa."
While the governing body was aware of the threat early on in the competition and may have prevented a large number of matches from being corrupted, the fact that 47 players and staff are understood to have been spoken to in the evidence-gathering process since leaves no doubt as to the scale of the problem.

What would drive a tennis champion to cheat?; 
Tennis is just the latest sport to be hit with allegations of corruption. Athletes are training so hard, then risking everything for a quick buck.

Steve Howell.

Sporting reputations are tumbling so fast, I doubt even Usain Bolt can keep up with them. We've had match-fixing in cricket and snooker, corruption in football, and doping in cycling, rugby, baseball and athletics. Now it's the turn of tennis - and back to fixing matches.
                     A joint Buzzfeed-BBC investigation found that highly ranked tennis players had, over a number of years, been investigated over allegations that they took money from gambling syndicates to throw matches. That may not come as much of a surprise after so many scandals. 
 Related:  Novak Djokovic tells of being offered $200,000 to fix a match
But the fact the group is said to include a Grand Slam winner does raise the question: why would people who have worked so hard to reach such heights risk everything for a fast buck? For those of us who can only dream of walking on to Centre Court at Wimbledon, it seems unfathomable that someone would be tempted to throw it away.
The money involved is not insignificant, of course. According to the Buzzfeed-BBC report, players were offered $50,000 (£35,000) or more per fix. Novak Djokovic says he once turned down $200,000 to lose a match early in his career. Leaving ethics aside, he cannot feel any financial regrets, having gone on to win, at the last count, just over $94m in prize money, not to mention many millions more for sponsorship and appearances.
However, for a lesser player whose career is waning, the offer of a five- or six-figure sum, possibly repeated several times a year, would look much more tempting: a nice earner before hanging up your racket.
When you see the headline numbers, professional sport seems very lucrative. But, with the exception of footballers, you don't have to go very far down the rankings to find talented people struggling financially. A few years ago, a golfer who had been playing on the European Tour told me he had decided to take a job as a club coaching professional because it would pay better than his tournament earnings after deducting expenses.
So, if the financial incentive to cheat could be attractive for some, what about the risks? In the case of tennis, only a handful of low-ranked players have been disciplined. The 16 top 50 players at the centre of the Buzzfeed-BBC allegations have continued to play since they were first investigated in 2008 because the authorities say there was insufficient evidence.
There's no suggestion there was a cover-up or corruption of the kind that has left international athletics in ruins, but the failure to act against any of the 16 is bound to create a perception that cheating is something you can get away with.
This risk-reward explanation is, though, simplistic and does not fit every case. It doesn't begin to explain, for example, why US athlete Marion Jones resorted to steroids very early in her career when most experts agree she could have won Olympic medals without them.
When she was interviewed on the Oprah Winfrey Show, after spending six months in prison for lying under oath about using performance-enhancing drugs, she tearfully persisted with a claim that her coach had originally told her the tablets were flaxseed oil.
Winfrey was criticised for giving Jones an easy ride in the interview, but she is not alone in showing some sympathy for the athlete's apparent naivety.
 Related:  Win at all costs, lose for a price - what do we exchange for purity in sport? | Matthew Beard
Dave Zirin, writing in The Nation magazine, said Jones had fame and fortune but was controlled by the men in her life. Under their influence, she became "less of a human being than a corporation with legs: Nike owned her feet, Oakley Sunglasses colonised her hypnotic eyes, and even her time was brought to her by the good people at TAG Heuer watches".
So we come back to the money, but in a wider sense. We have perhaps become so accustomed to commercial domination of sport we only notice it when something goes badly wrong.
In the case of athletics, the role of Nike in helping its home state of Oregon secure the 2021 world championship without a bidding process hardly registered in the British media until it became a political issue around Seb Coe's fitness to be the international governing body's president.
This new controversy in tennis is so far being discussed largely without calling into question the ethics of the global betting companies that were instrumental in the allegations in the first place.
Betting may be legal, but perhaps it's time to ask if it is bound to corrode the integrity of sport itself.
On Twitter, Roger Pielke, the University of Colorado professor who writes on sports governance, asked : "Does tennis match-fixing matter to anyone other than people who bet on tennis and companies that take bets on tennis?" Yes, it does. It also matters to fans who don't bet and are deprived of an authentic contest.

Not tennis too! Are there any 'clean' sports left?; 
As top-level tennis is investigated over match-fixing allegations, is any sport free from the taint of corruption? Not if these tales of scandal - from curling cheats to bowls scams - are anything to go by ....

Stephen Moss.

Tennis this week joined the roster of major sports being played under the shadow of corruption allegations. So where should the ethical sports lover turn? Are there any "clean" sports left? Let's try to find one ... 

Curling
It is hard to believe, but curling is a sport awash with allegations of cheating. Players have occasionally been upbraided for giving a stone a nudge with their foot, but the real issue is "dumping" - brushing the ice in front of a stone in such a way that you throw up debris and cause it to slow down.

Golf
The American golfer Bobby Jones, when asked why he had declared a penalty on himself in the 1925 US Open for a tiny infringement no one else had seen, said: "You might as well praise me for not robbing a bank." But it seems robbers do now roam the greens. In 2011, a survey of 50 PGA tour caddies revealed half had witnessed instances of cheating, such as moving the ball closer to the hole after marking a putt.

Snooker
Like all one-on-one sports, this is relatively easy to fix. All it takes is one player to be in hock to gamblers, and the latter can make a killing. In 2013, for example, former top 10 player Stephen Lee was banned for 12 years for match-fixing.

Fencing
Still trying to live down the infamous Onishchenko affair at the 1976 Olympics. In the fencing stage of the modern pentathlon, the Ukrainian-born Boris Onishchenko, competing for the Soviet Union, rigged his ÈpÈe so it would signal a hit on his opponent without any contact having been made. He was rumbled, thrown out of the Games, sacked from the Red Army and was last heard of driving a taxi in Kiev.

Bowls
Even lawn bowls has been besmirched by allegations of match-fixing. In 2009, a New Zealand team was accused of throwing a match against Thailand in order to get a more favourable draw in the quarter-finals. The players denied the allegations, but were disciplined by Bowls New Zealand.

Bridge
Forget sport, then. How about games? Still no luck, as it turns out. The bridge world is in uproar after a series of allegations of cheating made against several of the top pairs in the world. The accusations, which concern using coded signals to transmit the nature of your hand to your partner, are still under investigation, though one leading pair has owned up to an unspecified "ethical violation".

Chess
A chess app is now stronger than any human, and there have been several instances of cheating in tournaments. The most serious concerned French grandmaster Sebastien Feller, who in 2010 was found to have cheated in the Chess Olympiad by using two accomplices to feed him computer-generated moves. He was banned for three years but, to the dismay of some of his rivals, has now returned to competitive chess.
It seems that finding anything truly "clean" is well-nigh impossible. Anyone for Monopoly - but do you mind if I'm banker?

 That's all from us 
That was a real tussle in the end as the veteran pushed the 16th seed all the way but Tomic's class told in the end and after close to three hours he's through to the second round of his home slam! Thanks for joining us.

 Tomic wins it in four sets! 6-7, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4   
 4th set: Tomic 6-4 Istomin - Tomic wins it in four sets! 
Things started well for Tomic when an Istomin backhand clipped the tape and sat up to be put away, which was followed by an unforced error from the Uzbek as he tried for a winner down the line. Tomic's crunching first serve then set up the three match points and only one was required. Tomic is through to round two!

 4th set: *Tomic 5-4 Istomin (* denotes next server) Tomic leads 2-1 
Istomin skips out to 40-15 on serve and he's really unleashing with some of his groundstrokes but Tomic edges back ever so slightly with a defensive winner after withstanding the onslaught. Then he out-maneovers his opponent in a rally to make it deuce and goes better, establishing a break point. This is a big chance for the Aussie and he takes it, forcing Istomin into an awkward backhand that flies long. Tomic will now take a seat before coming out to serve for the match.

Something's gotta give here and for the first four points of this game it looks like it'll be the Tomic serve, but he digs in to drag himself back to deuce. A sliding serve sets him up for a forehand winner down the line and Istomin biffs one wide to help him hold serve. Another development: the most vocal elements of the Fanatics supporter group have absconded to the Hewitt match. Poor Bernie.

Some stats for you: Tomic's committed 41 unforced errors to Istomin's 30, which is what's got the Australian in trouble in a lot of instances. Istomin's hit more winners (+5), more aces (+6) and holds his serve again here, but he's never really broken Tomic's when it has counted.

Bernard Tomic might have been reasonably happy with his draw in the lead-up to this tournament but he'll be far from please with how long this is dragging on. From 40-15 on serve he flounders a little and it's soon deuce. That seems to gee him up somewhat and a thumping ace is followed by an Istomin error to keep it on serve. We might have another tiebreak on our hands.

 4th set: *Tomic 1-2 Istomin (* denotes next server) Tomic leads 2-1 
We're about to tick over the two-and-a-half hour mark now as Tomic leaps into a big forehand winner across court and that's followed with some finesse when he expertly disguises a cheeky drop shot, then another from which he gets lucky to open up a chance. He's poking his tongue out in delight at that turn of fortune. Istomin prevails in two rallies and in between fires down an ace to save all three break points. A few Tomic errors later the Australian has spurned a golden opportunity to run away with the match.

Which is fair, because both players have stood idle for 17 minutes as the situation was attended to.

Both men have to start again.

I'm not sure if it's related to either this match or Nadal's but apparently Twitter has crashed. What's Kim Kardashian up to at the moment? As that's all going on, or not going on as it were, Istomin moves to a 40-15 buffer on serve but there's some kind of medical emergency in the crowd so the match is held up for a number of minutes. Hopefully it's nothing too serious and both players have taken a respectful approach, having a quick chat at their chairs as the spectator is seen to. I'll have more as it's at hand.

As he slices a rather frustrating backhand into the net first up in this service game Tomic could be forgiven for seething but he's undemonstrative both then and when Istomin follows up with a big winner down the line. All of a sudden it's 0-40 and three break points for the Uzbek. 
Here's a test for Tomic. He produces a big serve down the line to save the first and crunches a forehand winner to take care of the next. What follows is even better; off balance and seemingly out of the point, Tomic still finds a way and thumps a forehand winner.

Logic is starting to prevail a little more as this match wears on. Tomic is up 30-0 when he stubs a backhand into the net but that's followed by a rasping forehand winner down the line and he's soon closing out the service game with ease.

Tomic's showing a bit of ruthlessness now to try and pile into the Istomin serve and get this set wrapped up quickly. At 30-30 Istomin buckles with a double fault but Tomic wastes the break point with a wild backhand not so much down the line as barely in its postcode. Istomin holds with an ace down the middle.

Hmm, interesting. There's a bit of an opening here for Istomin when he wins the first two points of the Tomic service game on his way to a couple of break points. Tomic steps up to the plate with two ice cold serves, the second of which is a big ace. Istomin nets a forehand to gift the Aussie advantage but then pulls out a remarkable roundhouse forehand winner. They're trading blows here and it takes Tomic an age to finally hold.
Meanwhile, Rafa's just gone down 6-2 in the fifth and a shocked sigh rings out across the press box. Nobody can believe it.

A heavy-handed backhand later he's handed Tomic another early break. Could this unravel for him now? Fernando Verdasco, meanwhile, is still a chance to knock off Rafael Nadal.

Ooft, there's a cracking backhand winner here from Tomic when Istomin's forehand drops a little short and that opens up a break point. Istomin serves strongly to save it but gets a little cute with a 'tweener to hand the Australian another opportunity. Then another save from Istomin, but only with a lucky roll over the net. With two booming serves the Uzbek holds.

Tomic is currently winning just 38% of his points on the second serve, by the way. In the immediate future it's not such a great concern because Istomin's serve also misfires again to hand the Australian three break points. They're mirroring each other. Istomin wallops a running forehand wide to concede the third break in as many games. It's hard to make any sense of this.

I don't want to tempt fate here but the Fanatics haven't been quite as obnoxious as some would expect so far. If you can't hear them, are the even there? A philosophical question to consider. When Istomin thumps a forehand past the baseline and then faults there's a little opening for Tomic at 30-15, but the Uzbek comes back with a strong kick serve to level it up before Tomic nets to hand him an opportunity to hold. With another error from the Aussie he does.

 Preamble 
Hello all and welcome to our live coverage of Australian Bernard Tomic's first outing in the 2016 Australian Open, in which he'll face Uzbekistan's wily, 59th-ranked tour veteran Denis Istomin.
We know plenty about Bernie at this point - that his big aim in the first half of the year is to crack the world top ten and if he does, these sorts of matches should be his bread and butter. Istomin actually won the last clash between these two in Washington back in 2014 but Tomic's taken out the other two matches they've played and certainly shouldn't drop this one.
"If I can win in a quicker time, get off the court as soon as I can, that would be a favour to me," Tomic said in the lead-up, saying he was keen to avoid the sweltering Melbourne heat in the opening rounds. Istomin's not in super form right now, so maybe that's likely. 
"I like playing him. He strokes the ball very well. He plays very good tennis. Beaten good players," Tomic said yesterday. "I prefer to step on court with him. I know his game. He knows mine."

Liberal plan for Bronwyn Bishop's seat decried as 'North Korean nepotism'; 
State MP Natasha Maclaren-Jones may stand for Mackellar and her place be taken by her husband and former Bishop chief of staff Damien Jones.

Daniel Hurst Political correspondent.

A mooted succession plan in Bronwyn Bishop's Sydney seat has been denounced by local Liberal party members as "North Korean nepotism".
Damien Jones, a former chief of staff to Bishop and a key figure in the "choppergate" scandal, has long been understood to have ambitions to succeed the MP for the northern beaches electorate of Mackellar.
A new possibility reported by the Sydney Morning Herald and the Australian would involve the New South Wales upper house member Natasha Maclaren-Jones standing for Mackellar and her place in state politics being taken by Jones - her husband. The plan would be predicated on Bishop's support. 
Jones, who is the president of the Mackellar federal electoral conference, said on Tuesday: "Mrs Bishop is running again and she has our support."
 Related:  Bronwyn Bishop says her chief of staff would be a good successor in Mackellar
A Liberal source told Guardian Australia: "It sounds more like North Korean nepotism than globally competitive Sydney and if that were to occur it would weaken the democratic structures of the Liberal party, because in a democratic party people want a democratic say in the outcomes."
The New South Wales Liberal party on Tuesday opened nominations for 22 Liberal-held federal seats, including Mackellar, which Bishop has represented since 1994.
It comes amid anger within Liberal party ranks over factional manoeuvring across NSW, with the moderates said to be on the march against conservative MPs and senators.
Bishop, Philip Ruddock, Craig Kelly and Angus Taylor face potential preselection challenges for their lower house seats. Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, who is the assistant minister for multicultural affairs and a conservative senator, and her long-serving upper house colleague Bill Heffernan, are also under pressure.
The major projects minister, Paul Fletcher, who is a close ally of the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said the preselection processes were simply "good, competitive discipline".
"This is not a job for life," he warned his colleagues during an interview on Sky News.
It is understood the federal director of the Liberal party, Tony Nutt, acting on behalf of the prime minister, has sought to calm the tensions by calling for stability in the NSW division.
The immigration minister, Peter Dutton, a prominent conservative, urged the party to maintain "a broad church" of conservative and liberal members.

"I believe very strongly, and will fight very strongly, to make sure that that diversity of views is heard for a long period of time to come, so if people have a thought in their mind that somehow they're going to knock out conservative candidates in NSW or anywhere else then I think I've made my position very clear," Dutton told Sky News.
"I think that would be the view of other colleagues within the parliamentary party in Canberra and obviously the prime minister has been very clear that it's his view as well."
Tony Abbott's former Senate leader, Eric Abetz, also writing in the Australian, called on the party to lock in behind Fierravanti-Wells and Taylor.
"Any talk of disendorsing such proven performers should be laughable," Abetz said. "Yet the threats are sadly serious."
Fierravanti-Wells said there was a lot of "posturing" during preselection processes but she welcomed the prime minister's stated support for sitting members.
"I led the Senate ticket in 2010 and I seek that honour again for the next federal election," she told Sky News. "In my case, I'd like to think I have plenty of positive things to talk about that I have done."
Bishop is facing pressure to bow out at this year's election, due to a combination of the damage she suffered from the expenses scandal last year and the fact she has held the seat for more than 20 years.
She has previously promoted Jones as a potential successor but it is believed Jones's standing was also damaged by his links to the expenses scandal that brought down the parliamentary speaker.
Rightwing sources said the rumours about Jones and Maclaren-Jones could lay the foundations for a tilt at the seat by a candidate from the left, such as the former Young Liberals president Jason Falinski.
Ruddock, who entered parliament in 1973 and served as immigration minister in the Howard government, is also under pressure to retire. Sources said a former executive director of the Menzies Research Centre, Julian Leeser, was likely to win preselection for Ruddock's seat of Berowra in the event of a challenge.
 Related:  Labor's Joel Fitzgibbon loses seat under proposal to redraw electoral boundaries
Peter Hendy, the Liberal MP for the marginal seat of Eden-Monaro and a close supporter of Turnbull, said Ruddock was well respected within the party for his decades of service.
"He is often described as a hero of the party, so whatever happens I think Philip needs to be treated with enormous respect," Hendy told Sky News.
On the other side of politics, the Labor frontbencher Anthony Albanese has disclosed the purchase of a property in the inner west Sydney suburb of Dulwich Hill, amid speculation about whether he will seek to change seats as a result of boundary changes.
Most of Dulwich Hill remains within his electorate of Grayndler under the boundary changes finalised by the Australian electoral commission last week.
Albanese updated his pecuniary interests register to say that the purchase occurred in December. It is understood he bought it as an investment property.
The house Albanese lives in has been pushed outside Grayndler in the boundary changes but his office remains inside the seat. He is yet to announce his intentions.
                     Figures published by the ABC's election analyst, Antony Green, suggest the number of notionally Coalition seats in NSW will decline from 30 to 27 after the boundary changes take effect, a development that is fuelling nervousness in Liberal ranks. The number of notionally Labor seats will increase from 18 to 20.

The fact that documentaries seeking to explain the modern western-bred jihadi have become such a television staple since 9/11 could be interpreted as an indication that we still really haven't figured out very much. Jamie Roberts's contribution to the genre, filmed over two years, may be lent unusual significance by gruesome happenstance. One of his subjects, former Walthamstow bouncy-castle salesman Abu Rumaysah, decamped to Syria, and is now suspected of being the ringleader depicted in recent Islamic State murder videos.

Adam Pearson: Freak Show 9pm, BBC3
Adam Pearson has neurofibromatosis, which causes non-cancerous tumours to grow along his nerve endings. The condition has caused severe facial disfigurement. Name-calling and comparisons with Joseph Merrick have blighted his life. But is Pearson, as one of his interviewees puts it, "a freak in the closet" who's turning his back on the empowering possibilities of using his appearance to make a living? In a poignant documentary, the TV presenter and actor (Under the Skin) heads to the US to explore modern-day freak shows. Jonathan Wright

Dick Cavett's Watergate 9pm, PBS America
With his cravats and loud check jackets, TV presenter, standup and sometime gameshow host Dick Cavett seems an odd character to have been at the centre of the Nixon scandal in the mid-1970s. However, his jovial persistence in seeking to uncover the truth about Watergate goaded the president to the point that he asked his henchmen: "Cavett... how can we screw him?" This film documents his battles with the White House, as well as the unfolding of the Watergate affair, as told by those involved. David Stubbs

Phone Shop Idol 10pm, BBC2
Each year the mobile phone industry holds a competition called Shop Idol, in which retail assistants compete for a prize. This reality series introduces us to competitors such as Maria and Jonny from the big chains, who shine even in entities such as Tesco and EE, and Andy from Sunderland, representing independent shops. It's warm-hearted stuff - but cuteness won't cut it with the judges, especially tech guru Sunetra. "Why should I be forgiving if someone doesn't know something?" she asks. "I'm not their mum."

Manchester's Serial Killer? 11pm, Channel 4
Between 2008 and 2014, the bodies of 72 men were pulled from the waterways around Manchester; 28 of them are still recorded as unexplained deaths. Are these fatalities connected? Are they the work of a serial killer called the Pusher? Amid heartbreaking stories from the families who lost sons, an independent investigator looks into some of the open verdicts again. And, true to form in any crime documentary with a question mark in the title, in the closing minutes he answers the question with some certainty.  Julia Raeside

 That match in numbers 
No real surprises here. Murray had 28 winners to Zverev's 23, 20 unforced errors to his opponent's spiralling 43 and won six break points to none, stepping up where it counted and never truly giving the German teenager an opening. That's about it from us here but thanks for joining me for the live action from Margaret Court Arena.

 Murray pays tribute to his plucky opponent  
"It's obviously tough conditions today," says the Scot as he starts his post-match interview. "It seemed like all the games were going to deuce" he adds, paying tribute to Zverev. "He hung right in until the end...He's one of the best young players in the world and he's going to be around for a very long time. He made it very tough for me." 
He says it's about sustaining this level throughout the tournament and says he's hopefully learned from lapses in the past. "I'm hoping my phone hasn't been buzzing in my bag," he jokes when discussing impending fatherhood. With that, he signs the camera lens and trots out of the arena for a well-earned shower.

In the blink of an eye Murray threatens to close this match out, climbing into Zverev's tiring serve to set up a couple of break and match points. But the German fights back again, stringing together a couple of big serves and then a resounding ace down the middle to claim the advantage. But he can't hold out much longer and rather fittingly, nets to hand the Scot the game, set and match. Murray's through to the second round in straight sets!

It's far hotter out there now than it was at the start of the match, with the mercury currently pushing 30 degrees and the temperature on court no doubt a lot hotter still. Zverev has a gilt-edged chance to make it 30-0 clawing into Murray's serve but nets when the court was open for a winner. Zverev's up to 40 unforced errors now to Murray's 20. It's really mattered out there. With a brisk venture to the net to put away the volley, Murray holds.

 Third set: *Murray 4-3 Zverev (*denotes next server) Murray leads 2-0 
Zverev threatens to unravel a little at the start of this service game but does push a nice sliced serve across court to claw his way back to 15-30 and then darts in to the net to retrieve a drop shot and level it all up. He's certainly not rolling over. Again the Zverev service game drags on forever, so long in fact that Murray stops to change his racquet. The one it replaced must be worn out. Finally Zverev holds and it was another determined effort to do so. 
Venus Williams, meanwhile, has legged it.

 Third set: Murray 4-2 Zverev* (*denotes next server) Murray leads 2-0 
Perhaps a little agitated by the way his opponent is stringing this out, Murray gets both ruthless and a little lucky when he clips the net with a forehand to establish a 40-0 lead but Zverev rolls his wrists over a classic around-the-net forehand winner before conceding a cheap game. He's giving the crowd something to watch here, the youngster.

 Third set: *Murray 3-2 Zverev (*denotes next server) Murray leads 2-0 
The end is nigh for Zverev, but he's never giving up on rallies or letting his opponent relax, unleashing an overhead smash after saving a couple of likely winners with mad scrambles at the baseline. The German is not without his chances here and after looking like he'll wilt again, finally holds serve. Good on him.
Reader Angela Macdonald-Smith has some evidence for the prosecution. "I think you're being a little hard on andy's singing quartet of fans!" she says. "Sounded like 'Andy Murray is the best on earth' from where I'm sitting on MCA!" I stand corrected.

He might be edging towards an inevitable first-round victory here but Andy Murray is still muttering at himself and shaking his head when he belts an unforced error into the net to make it 15-15 on serve. A few points later he sets up two game points with an inch-perfect backhand drop shot, on which he imparted the ideal amount of slice. Murray holds with ease.

Zverev sets off on another service game and as he does so I might as well update you on progress elsewhere. Aussie Sam Groth has taken down Adrian Mannarino in four sets and Milos Raonic has easily accounted for Frenchman Lucas Pouille in a straight sets win. Up 5-0 in the fourth against Diego Schwartzman, John Millman has actually gotten the win with his opponent retiring. With that, we're back at deuce on Zverev's serve and there's plenty of to and fro for the advantage before Murray clips a backhand wide to concede.

I'm sure the object of their affections is thrilled for their presence. From 40-15 down Zverev somehow claws his way back to deuce and then a break point with a rasping forehand winner. The crowd is full of appreciation for his endeavour but Murray fights back to hold from a Zverev error.

He's lacking in polish and nowhere near the physical equal of his cyborg opponent, but Zverev is at least having a decent crack today and never timid in unleashing his array of shots. Unforced errors hurt though and here he whacks down his 6th double fault of the match. Murray opens up break point and creams that double-handed backhand of his down the line for a resounding winner.

 Second set: Murray 6-2 Zverev* (*denotes next server) Murray leads 2-0 
Murray pummels another big ace across court to make it 3 for the day (Zverev's managed 3 also) and it's 30-0. But I tell you what has been a bit odd today? The amount of smashes that Murray is missing. Well, not even missing, just not quite ever winding up on. I'm just picking faults where I shouldn't, I guess. He closes out this service game to take the second set. It's a cakewalk for the Scot.

There's another match of note taking place now as Zverev resumes on serve - Aussie John Millman is 5-0 up in the fourth set after losing the first two sets to Argentinean Diego Schwartzman. I'll keep an eye out on that but in the meantime, Zverev holds his serve! "Andy Murray is a place on earth" sing those muppets from earlier. That doens't even make sense.

 Second set: Murray 5-1 Zverev* (*denotes next server) Murray leads 1-0 
As Murray continues to go through the motions I'm here to tell you that Johanna Konta has completed her remarkable upset of 8th seed Venus Williams, taking it out 6-4, 6-2 to stun the crowd on Rod Laver Arena. I can't quite hear what she's saying as she conducts her post-match interview but the beaming smile says it all. 
Murray has got a minor fight on his hands here too with his young opponent winning a break point but the Scot slams a big first serve down the line and Zverev can't get it back in court. It's a prolonged tussle from there with Murray labouring on his serve and sending down a double-fault, but he closes it out with a swift first serve down the line.

If you're wondering, Zverev's first serve is coming down at 209 kmph, a decent clip but perhaps not the weapon he'd have hoped it would be in this match. At 30-15 on his second serve the thumps another forehand long and seems a little agitated that his plans aren't quite coming together under the pressure of such a big match. Murray works his way to another break point and on Zverev's second serve he whips another superb cross-court winner on the forehand. The Brit is looking sharp now.

He's having the odd wobbly moment with his ball toss here but Murray recovers well to curl a wonderful cross-court forehand past a fully-stretched Zverev to make it 15-15. It's not all he's got but Zverev's hustle wins him a break point here and a brief nervy moment for Murray. The Scot holds firm with a strong first serve and the German is flinging his racquet around after netting a forehand to give up game point, which he also squanders with a heavy backhand.
Elsewhere Venus Williams has broken Johanna Konta's serve to stage a comeback of sorts. It's 5-2 in the second and 30-30 on Konta's serve.

This is better from Zverev. At 15-0 he works Murray around the court nicely and then charges the net to set up a volleyed winner. That's soon 40-0 and Murray engages in some subtle gamesmanship by making the German wait with his next serve loaded. It's in vain though - Murray rotates into a big forehand but cracks it wide to cough up a love game. And Johanna Konta now leads Venus Williams 5-0 in the second!

Murray's really flexing his muscles now, hammering his first serve down the line in such a manner that the youngster can barely lay his racquet on it and then at 40-0 Murray pushes Zverev wide with a slashing forehand to close out another brief service game. He could conserve a lot of energy for coming rounds here.

That is a boilover of significant proportions. Back here on Margaret Court Arena, Murray gets an early break of the Sverev serve. That's a little more expected at this point.

Zverev is wearing the pained expression of a young man who believes the gods are out to get him but he sets the crowd on fire by chasing down everything Murray gives him in a rally to claim what seemed an un-winnable point. He's dashing, sliding and throwing himself around with plenty of energy but the errors take a toll in this Murray service game and the Scot soon has a couple of set points and only needs one, with the German cracking a cross-court backhand wide.

Having set down and refreshed himself, Zverev returns with an ace to get some confidence back but he's soon making a hash of a rally in which he held control, haring about the court and chasing until Murray puts him out of his misery. At 15-15 the German whips a lovely forehand winner hard and flat down the line but for each eye-catching moment like that Murray's able to put him back in his place with superior groundstrokes. 
Another ace gives Zverev an opportunity to hold but soon he's defending a break point after clubbing a cross-court forehand long and then a volley wide. A few unsuccessful line reviews later he's coughed up another break. Welcome to the big time kid.

More on that as it's at hand.

Murray's briefly amused by it but then starts pacing around to try and keep himself warm as the German tips his head back trying to stem the flow. Then a doctor appears, which seems a little rash, but Murray busies himself practicing his serve. It's all a bit strange. I'll be back with more tennis when there's some of it to describe.

 Preamble 
Hello tennis fans and welcome to our coverage of Andy Murray's first hit-out of the Australian Open, a far from straightforward assignment against the bulked-up Alxander Zverev, an 18-year-old German whose work with Murray's own former strength and conditioning man Jaz Green is currently reaping huge dividends, as Kevin Mitchell notes here.
We know what we can expect from the second-seeded Brit but what about 83rd-ranked Zverev? Well, he's 6'6" on the old scale - almost two metres tall - and boasts a booming first serve. He's experienced in these Melbourne conditions having taken out the junior boys title a few years back and has a rather one-sided Hopman Cup clash against Murray behind him and also a loss to Nick Kyrgios in that tournament. Whether things will play out any differently today remains to be seen, but he's certainly got power in his still-maturing frame.
Related to all this: the corporate bookies are really making their presence felt in the lead-up to this encounter. I'm issuing a high level #banter alert.

Win at all costs, lose for a price - what do we exchange for purity in sport?; 
The Essendon saga and tennis match-fixing allegations may seem diametrically opposed, but common elements highlight the tension between ethics in sport and ideas of 'winning'.

Matthew Beard.

For at least 2,500 years people have talked about the ethical dimension of sport. Plato recommended sport as a means of teaching good character in The Republic. The Olympic Charter claims the practice of sport as a human right. Even Popes have offered their two cents on the ethical value of sport - Pope Pius XII said "Sport, properly directed, develops character, makes a man courageous, a generous loser, and a gracious victor; it refines the senses, gives intellectual penetration, and steels the will to endurance". 
But flick over the sports headlines today and you'll get a very different story. First it was the Essendon saga, running since 2013 and revived last week after the CAS verdict and James Hird's "tell-all" interview. Yesterday as the Australian Open began we were informed of the so-called "Tennis Racket" - allegations of widespread match-fixing and corruption in professional tennis.  
At first sight these two cases seem diametrically opposed. On the one hand, Essendon's willingness to operate either at the boundaries of what was legal, or entirely beyond those limits, demonstrates an excessive attitude toward the importance of winning. By contrast, the willingness of certain tennis players to throw matches or tank sets in exchange for a payout shows a deficient attitude toward the fair competition inherent to sport. 
 Related:  Hird accepts 'a level' of responsibility for Essendon supplements scandal
Anyone who has studied undergraduate philosophy is familiar with Aristotle's notion of the Golden Mean. It's the idea that we can discover a virtue by looking for the mean (as in arithmetic mean, not nasty mean) between two vicious kinds of behaviour - the vice of deficiency and the vice of excess. On that understanding, these two cases are literally the opposite to one another, erring toward different extremes. 
There's an academic neatness to this interpretation but it risks overlooking a common element between the two cases - a belief that is responsible for some of the most insidious ethical violations we see every day: "win at all costs". It's an insidious mentality not unique to, but to typical of, professional sport, and it makes ethics, law, player safety all become subservient to some greater "good". 
It's pretty clear how a win at all costs mentality informed the Essendon decision. Ironically, Essendon's 2013 motto was "whatever it takes", which they had apparently taken very literally the previous year. We shouldn't be surprised to see this mentality in professional sport - a world where being a "winner" or "loser" is more than a metaphor, it's reality. 
The same belief may well sit at the heart of the corruption that has been alleged against professional tennis. Tanking matches and accepting bribes to lose may seem like the opposite of a "win at all costs" approach, but that's only if we have a narrow conception of winning. If we allow the possibility of winners and losers off the court as well it's easier to see the common element here. 
By accepting bribes in exchange for losing what former tennis player Daniel Kˆllerer (a convicted match fixer who maintains his innocence) describes as "one stupid match", tennis players reveal their desire to be financial "winners" - it can guarantee a relatively low-ranked athlete a life of comfort and success at the end of their career, even if they never reach centre court. If the cost is occasionally throwing a low-profile match, so be it.
 Related:  Not tennis too! Are there any 'clean' sports left?
There are structural and individual lessons to be taken here. On an immediate level, it highlights the need for senior sports administrators to recognise the tension between the "purity" of sport and its corporate nature. Taking money out of sport isn't going to happen, but the ways it can compromise integrity and public trust can be recognised as a threat and managed transparently, coherently and responsibly. Otherwise, professional sport - populated by would-be "winners" - will remain especially vulnerable. 
It also highlights why any sport on which a betting market exists needs to be able to provide its athletes with a reasonable wage. Yes, the refusal of Football Australia to pay the Matildas a fair wage is sexist and unkind, but it also makes Australian football vulnerable to corruption. If it's possible to make as much money by giving away a penalty in "one stupid match" as you make in a year, it becomes much easier to say yes. 
On an individual level it highlights the practical danger in turning professional athletes into "winners". Not only does a "win at all cost" mentality have on-field consequences - as the Essendon case reveals - but it undermines public trust in sport and athletes altogether.
When Popes and philosophers wax lyrical about the value of sport, they recognise the intrinsic value of sport to living an ethical life. Sport promises the development of virtue, the opportunity to overcome physical limitations and the opportunity to engage with your physical embodiment. 
It's romantic to think these traits would be the only ones inculcated in athletes, but it's not too much to hope they might be seen as costs any professional athlete would be unwilling to pay in exchange for victory.

Jimmy Savile inquiry leak reveals scathing criticism of BBC; 
Dame Janet Smith's report claims that predatory child abuser could be lurking undiscovered in the BBC even now.

Nicola Slawson.

A draft report into the BBC's practices at the time of the Jimmy Savile scandal has been leaked by the investigative news website, Exaro.
The review led by Dame Janet Smith is said to include "devastating detail" of the broadcaster's "sheer scale of awareness" of the late TV and radio star's activities.
It will criticise the corporation's culture, according to Exaro, which says it has seen a leaked draft. 
The report is said to point to a "deferential culture", "untouchable stars" and "above the law" managers at the corporation. However, the BBC cannot be criticised for failing to uncover Savile's "sexual deviancy", it says.
The retired judge's report outlines multiple rapes and indecent assaults on children by Savile which she claims were all "in some way associated with the BBC". 
A BBC spokesman said they would not be commenting as they had not yet seen the final report or the draft. He said: "We cannot confirm the authenticity or contents of the leaked report and we don't believe Exaro has the full version."
In the afterword of the leaked report, which contains more than 37,500 words over 500 pages, the retired judge states: "Finally, I wish to consider whether it is possible that a predatory child abuser could be lurking undiscovered in the BBC even today. The answer is that I think it is possible."
According to Exaro, one section says: "He [Savile] would indulge in sexual touching while working on the set [of Top of the Pops or Jim'll Fix It] and on at least one occasion, he was actually on camera. Savile would seize the opportunity for sexual contact even in public places such as corridors, staircases and canteens".
Savile indecently assaulted an underage girl on the set of Top of the Pops in 1969, the report says. The girl told a member of floor staff, who ejected her from the building.
Savile also assaulted a 17-year-old girl on camera on Top of the Pops in 1976. She too complained to floor staff but "her complaint was brushed aside with the explanation that that was 'just Jimmy fooling about'," writes Smith in the leaked report.
Savile would arrange for particular girls to be on the podium next to him during the making of Top of the Pops and a producer said in the late 1970s that "Savile always used to choose the girls and boys he wanted close to him ... instead of letting the director or floor manager choose them". 
One witness in the report states: "Apart from the regular members of Savile's team, I know of at least two young girls [both underage] who were invited back to Savile's dressing room, where he abused them sexually."
Smith says most of Savile's rapes and sex abuse crimes took place in his flat or caravans, but admitted that she had heard of incidents occurring in "virtually every one of the BBC premises at which he worked".
In the chapter on the BBC's management culture, Exaro reports that Smith tells how a production assistant complained of a sexual assault by a colleague at the World Service between 1981 and 1984. The assistant was told by the personnel department that making a complaint would be "not making the right decision".
The report reads: "Several people who suffered at Savile's hands were not prepared to make any complaint.
"Perhaps the most stark example is [unnamed witness]. She was 19 and almost raped by Savile in his caravan, but, after having discussed the matter with colleagues, decided not to make any complaint either to the police or to the BBC.
"It was difficult in the BBC to make a complaint about another member of staff, it is not hard to imagine how much more difficult it must have been to make a complaint about a member of the 'talent' such as Savile."
Smith's investigation has interviewed 375 witnesses in connection with Savile, who died in 2011.
Earlier on Wednesday, it was announced that the final report would be published within six weeks, after police said they were no longer concerned about the report prejudicing ongoing investigations.

Billionaire supports reported inquiry into possible ExxonMobil cover-up; 
Activist Tom Steyer's comments followed reports that California attorney general is looking into what the world's biggest oil company knew about climate change.

Anita Chabria in Sacramento.

 Billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer spoke out on Wednesday in support of an unconfirmed investigation by California into allegations that ExxonMobil spent decades lying to investors and the public about its knowledge of climate change. 
 "We don't have the facts yet, but I think that there is enough that has been revealed that it's totally appropriate that (California) be conducting this investigation," Steyer told the Guardian. "Anybody who puts out intentionally misleading information I think should be answering to us."
 Steyer's comments came hours after the Los Angeles Times reported that California's attorney general, Kamala Harris, is looking into what ExxonMobil, the world's biggest oil company, knew about climate change going as far back as the early 1980s. 
 Harris's office declined to comment on the report, writing in an email: "We can't comment on any ongoing or potential investigation," according to press secretary Rachele Huennekens.
 Previously published reports suggest ExxonMobil may have spent millions over 27 years to publicly promote opposition to climate change science while privately basing strategies and business models around it.
 The Guardian reported in July on a company email from Exxon's in-house climate expert that provided evidence that the company was aware, over a generation ago, of the connection between fossil fuels and climate change, and the potential for carbon-cutting regulations that could hurt its bottom line. It may have factored that knowledge into its decision about a large gas field in southeast Asia. The field, off the coast of Indonesia, would have been the single largest source of global warming pollution at the time.
 New York's attorney general is also conducting a similar probe into ExxonMobil based on previously published reports by the Los Angeles Times and the Columbia University Energy and Environmental Reporting Fellowship. 
 But, Steyer said, California, as the "largest and most populous state" offers a "particularly strong platform" to increase the reach of any investigation. 
 "I'm not a lawyer but I believe the laws in California are different and give our attorney general a lot of leeway in terms of how she approaches it," he said. 
 RL Miller, chair of the California Democratic party's environmental caucus, added that the Los Angeles and Ventura Democratic party recently passed a resolution she wrote calling on Harris to investigate ExxonMobil. Harris is currently running for US Senate and will seek the party's endorsement during its February convention.
 "I wanted to bring it up with Democrats because if she wants the Democrats' endorsements, she needs to listen to Democrats," said Miller of her outreach to Harris. 
 Like other climate change activists, Steyer also linked ExxonMobil's alleged cover-up to similar scandals in the tobacco industry, which for many years fought to deny the negative health effects of smoking. 
 With climate change, "there is obviously a gigantic impact on the entire world and all the people of the world", said Steyer. "It's a society being misled."

George Osborne backs Christine Lagarde for second term at IMF; 
Chancellor says former French finance minister is an outstanding leader who has the vision 'to help steer the global economy through the years ahead'.

Phillip Inman economics correspondent.

George Osborne has backed Christine Lagarde's attempt for a second term as managing director of the International Monetary Fund.
The chancellor nominated the former French finance minister for another four years as head of the Washington-based organisation, saying she was an outstanding leader who had the vision "to help steer the global economy through the years ahead". 
                     Osborne's backing for Lagarde in 2011 was considered a major coup by her supporters along with the support from German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch‰uble. 
The chancellor said on Wednesday: "I nominated Christine for her first term in May 2011 and since then she has exhibited outstanding leadership, skilfully steering the Fund through big economic challenges, while working hard to deliver historic reforms to the IMF.
"At a time when the world faces what I've called a dangerous cocktail of risks, I believe Christine has the vision, energy and acumen to help steer the global economy through the years ahead."
Traditionally the heads of the IMF and World Bank have been drawn from the US and Europe. The current head of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, is a US citizen and was nominated by Barack Obama.
There have been calls in recent years for the IMF to look for a leader from the developing world, but Lagarde's championing of reforms to the IMF's constitution - allowing for greater representation by poorer countries - is likely to be enough to deflect accusations of western bias.
However, she could come under pressure to drop out of the race after she was told to stand trial in France because of a multimillion-euro government payment to a controversial tycoon who supported Nicolas Sarkozy in 2007 presidential race.
Lagarde has been accused of "negligence by a person in a position of public authority" over the award of more than (EURO)400m (£308m) to Bernard Tapie in a case against the French public bank CrÈdit Lyonnais, which he accused of undervaluing his stake in Adidas.
Prosecutors said Lagarde, at the time Sarkozy's finance minister, referred the long-running case to arbitration and signed off the payout.
The IMF will want to steer clear of controversy after Lagarde's predecessor Dominique Strauss-Kahn was forced to resign following a sex scandal.
Awaiting the next IMF boss are a series of severe tests, including a global economic slowdown that several senior economists have warned could be a forerunner of a 2008-style crash.
As lender of last resort, the IMF helped bail out Ireland, Portugal, Greece, Hungary and Iceland after the financial crash and could be called on to make another series of loans should the situation deteriorate.

Tories paid Lynton Crosby firm £2.4m for election campaign work; 
Electoral Commission spending data shows value of party's relationship with strategist recently awarded a knighthood.

Harry Davies and Rowena Mason.

The Conservatives paid £2.4m to a lobbying firm co-owned by Sir Lynton Crosby, David Cameron's campaign strategist, in the run-up to the general election, according to new Electoral Commission data.
The latest campaign spending figures reveal for the first time the full value of the party's relationship with CTF Partners, the company co-founded by the Australian who is widely credited with engineering the Tories' victory at the ballot box last year.
Crosby came under fire last month after the prime minister awarded him a knighthood, a move that prompted accusations the government has turned the honours systems into an "old boys' club". 
Responding to the spending figures, the Labour MP Jess Phillips said the Tories had "lavished millions on their election campaign, including with Lynton Crosby's firm, and he has since been richly rewarded with a knighthood". 
She added: "Sadly the choices the Tories have made since the election show, as per usual, it's working families again paying the price."
Overall, the commission's figures show the Conservatives spent almost £16m before the election, while Labour's bill came to £12m including £577 on "chicken suits", which the party has previously used in photo opportunities. 
 Related:  How Lynton Crosby (and a dead cat) won the election: 'Labour were intellectually lazy'
The data also suggests the Tory party has leapfrogged Labour on the digital campaign trail. While the Tories spent £1.2m on advertising with Facebook, Labour spent just £16,000. This was considerably less than Ukip, which paid over £90,000 to the social network.
Although UK political parties cannot buy TV or radio advertising, there are, however, no restrictions on spending when it comes to online advertising. In the run-up to the last election the Conservatives launched a pre-roll ad on YouTube that has received almost 270,000 views. 
Out on the campaign trail, the Conservatives appeared to enjoy luxuries Labour was unable to afford. The party paid almost £250,000 to two private jet firms and a heliport in London. 
There was no sign of spending on the controversial Road Trip campaign hit by claims of bullying and harassment by its organiser, Mark Clarke, which he has denied. 
However, there was almost £3,000 signed off to one of Clarke's associates, India Brummitt, who resigned as a parliamentary aide at the height of the scandal. About £430 of spending on the battle bus campaign run by Clarke was signed off by the chairman's office - indicating the budget of Grant Shapps and Lord Feldman. The signature of the director who approved the spending is redacted.
In terms of overall advertising expenditure - across print and online - the Tories splashed out £3.6m, which dwarfed the £900,000 spent by Labour. 
Beneficiaries of the Tories' lavish ad spending included M&C Saatchi, the advertising agency behind attack ads that depicted Ed Miliband in the pockets of Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond, and a more digitally oriented firm, VCCP. 
Parties are required by the commission to provide receipts for campaign expenditure, excluding staff costs. Overall, the latest disclosure shows six political parties reported spending of £36m, an increase of £6m on the 2010 campaign. 
The Liberal Democrats, which suffered heavy losses on election night, spent just £3.5m on their campaign.

UK Anti-Doping calls for meeting with ArsËne Wenger over drugs in football; 
∑ Chief executive says 'something doesn't feel right' ∑ Wenger has been outspoken about doping in the game.

Owen Gibson.

UK Anti-Doping has called for a meeting with ArsËne Wenger over his concerns about drugs in football and said it would be naive to believe the sport does not have a problem. 
The Ukad chief executive, Nicole Sapstead, who also said it could play a role in overhauling Russia's discredited anti-doping system in the wake of the IAAF scandal, said she would welcome a meeting with Wenger.
The Arsenal manager has been outspoken over many years in his belief football has a doping problem that is not being confronted, two years ago saying the sport is " full of legends who are in fact cheats ".
He returned to the subject recently, calling on Uefa to do more blood tests after the Dinamo Zagreb midfielder Arijan Ademi tested positive following a Champions League victory over Arsenal. Sapstead, said she would "be interested to speak with him and hear what he's got to say" but would not elaborate on whether the Football Association had passed on any specific concerns after it recently contacted Wenger.

"I think it's foolish for any sport to think that they're immune from doping, I really do," Sapstead said. "You've got a sport that commands huge salaries - players command huge salaries - there's huge television rights. There's a lot to be gained from doping, irrespective of looking at the physiological requirements of the game itself. Look at how the game is played, the recovery rate with injuries. Football, tennis, other sports: something doesn't feel right." Sapstead called for sport and governments to invest more in the fight against doping and for athletes to blow the whistle if they had any suspicions.
"You can't sit there and criticise an organisation like us, with limited resources, that we're not doing enough," she said. "Because people like Lance Armstrong and Marion Jones show you can test people until you're blue in the face and you still won't catch them because they had a network behind them that was so much more sophisticated than what we're able to achieve right now."
Sapstead confirmed Ukad could sign a contract to help Russia re-establish its laboratories to a Wada compliant standard in the wake of the country's ban from athletics over a huge state-sponsored doping programme.
She said Wada had made an initial approach to Ukad but that no contract had yet been signed. Meanwhile, the IAAF has sent inspection teams to Russia to begin the process of assessing whether it should return to athletics in time for the Rio Olympics. "If you are talking about state-sponsored doping you question whether it is just limited to just athletics, you have to be careful you are not singling one sport out in an effort to avoid a bigger issue. If anyone thinks this is purely about Russia and purely about athletics they are supremely naive," Sapstead said.
"It is not single figures in the countries where they need to do more, I'm not saying it's state-sponsored or corrupt [but] it's whether they are fit for purpose? I would say there is a big question mark over a number of countries' anti-doping organisations."

 Sarah Palin writes on Facebook that her campaign appearances alongside Republican juggernaut Donald Trump  are proceeding as planned.
The media, including this media, speculated that the partnership might not be going as planned since the Trump campaign had announced that Palin would be at his Iowa event this morning tickets for which advertised a "special guest" but then she was not there and neither was any other guest. So what was up with that?
Palin writes :

 Carly Fiorina's second stop of the day was at a right-to-life event in Des Moines' botanical garden, reports the Guardian's Adam Gabbatt: 
About 60 people attended. There was a lot of grey hair.
 Fiorina shepherded in about 15 children, all about 3 years old. There was applause. She guided the children to the front of the room, in front of the audience. She stood behind them in front of a 9ft x 9ft banner bearing a picture of a foetus. On a wall to the right a television was playing a video showing the week-by-week development of a foetus.

Fiorina was introduced by a pro-life activist, who told the crowd that the former Hewlett-Packard CEO was firmly anti-abortion.
 "What you read about her is true,"  the activist said. "Well, the good stuff."
Fiorina became opposed to abortion  after accompanying a friend  to undergo the procedure, she said. She also said she had met "almost as many world leaders as Hillary Clinton", but that she "didn't do photo ops with them".
At the end of the event a woman walked over to Fiorina with a little plastic model of a foetus.

 "This is the face of abortion," the woman said, holding the model high in the air. It was sucking its thumb.
"This is who we're defending when we say we need to end late abortion," she continued.
Fiorina looked on solemnly. She would end abortion, she said. 
At the end of her speech people walked over to talk to her. It was an older crowd. There weren't many selfies.
 The plastic foetus was placed on a table by the exit. An organiser told the crowd that they were welcome to examine it.

 White House vows aid in Flint water crisis  
In a press gaggle on the president's flight to Detroit, Michigan, this morning, White House spokesman Eric Schultz touted the administration's efforts to assist with the drinking-water-slash-governmental-neglect crisis in Flint, Michigan. 
"The president ... met with the mayor yesterday and he wants to make sure we are marshaling all the resources of the federal government," Schultz said, according to a traveling press pool report.
Schultz declined to comment on whether Michigan governor Rick Snyder, who accepted responsibility for the crisis Tuesday night, should resign.
"There can be no excuse," Snyder said in a state of the state address. "When Michiganders turn on the tap, they expect and they deserve clean, safe water. It is that simple."

"Our view is right now everybody should be focused on the actual problem," Schultz said. "Clearly, primary responsibility lies with local and state officials," but that fact won't stop the federal government from helping out, he said.
The president is expected to address the crisis in a speech this afternoon in Detroit. Schultz said Obama was "disappointed something like this could happen in the greatest country on Earth."

 Ta-Nehisi Coates, whose 2015 Between the World and Me won a National Book Award, has sharply criticized Vermont senator Bernie Sanders over the candidate's opposition to reparations for slavery,  writes the Guardian's Lauren Gambino:
Asked during Fusion's Black and Brown forum last week if he would be in favor reparations, Sanders replied: "No, I don't think so. First of all, its likelihood of getting through Congress is nil. Second of all, I think it would be very divisive." 
    "Divisive." Photograph: Jim Young/Reuters   
Coates, whose 2014 Atlantic magazine cover story The Case for Reparations stoked a broad discussion about race and justice in America, writes in a new Atlantic piece that Sanders's opposition to reparations was ironic, given the improbability of Sanders's own candidacy:
"The spectacle of a socialist candidate opposing reparations as "divisive" (there are few political labels more divisive in the minds of Americans than socialist) is only rivaled by the implausibility of Sanders posing as a pragmatist" Coates writes.
Sanders's "radicalism" when it comes to taking on the billionaire class and Wall Street, Coates adds, had "failed in the ancient fight against white supremacy".

Republican candidates Marco Rubio  and John Kasich have been pitching to the New Hampshire House of Representatives, who earn just $100 a year, the Guardian's David Smith reports from Concord, New Hampshire: 
Rubio, the Florida senator, recalled how financial hardship 15 years ago led him to kneel in church to pray for guidance and taught him lessons about public service. The main thrust of his speech was to contrast the nobility of local politics with the government industrial complex of Washington.
"Before me sits the largest state legislature in the country, meaning you each represent, on average, just a few thousand people - many of whom you know not from campaigning, but from childhood, from the checkout line at the grocery store, from church or school board meetings," he said, speaking under a portrait of George Washington in the oldest chamber in the US still in continuous legislative use.
    Marco makes 'em smile. Photograph: Jim Cole/AP   
"One truth I know is that independence runs in your veins. 'Live free or die. ' That call to action inspires and echoes through the generations. If Washington encroaches on our states, we will forfeit much of what makes us different, and special, and unique from all the nations on the earth."
Apart from a swipe at Barack Obama, whom he accused of trying to control the economy, healthcare and "even the weather", Rubio s teered clear of the darker tone he has adopted of lat e but, trailing conservative Ted Cruz, he was careful to reference God and the power of prayer more than once. "Despite everything going wrong in our country today, I believe with all my heart that God is not done with America yet."
Ohio governor Kasich, reportedly enjoying a surge in the New Hampshire polls, gave a less polished account of his life in politics but also appealed to anti-Washington sentiment, telling the House: "I believe in running our country from the bottom up."
    Those pictures are not going to turn out. Photograph: Jim Cole/AP   
He called for an overhaul of education policy and for bipartisan cooperation on issues such as combating drug addiction. "Our children are dying, our people are at risk... When we work together to solve problems, we leave a legacy, a legacy our children and grandchildren will remember."
Afterwards a local Rubio campaign staffer was upbeat, claiming that his "sincerity" is winning appeal wherever he goes. A Kasich operative shrugged off the polls, noting they have a habit of going up and down, and said Donald Trump is a "phenomenon" who will be in good shape if his success translates into votes.

    "He's fine. He's two-faced."  
Donald Trump this morning launched his most strident attack so far on Ted Cruz, but all the talk in Norwalk, Iowa, was about what didn't happen at the Republican frontrunner's campaign event, reports the Guardian's Ben Jacobs,  from the scene:
Despite promises of a special guest, which was featured on tickets and in emails to supporters, Sarah Palin didn't appear less than one day after she endorsed Trump in a rambling disjointed speech at a rally in Ames, Iowa. 
The Trump campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment about Palin's absence. 
However, Trump tweeted that the former Republican vice presidential nominee would appear at his event later in the afternoon in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Without Palin present, Trump accused  Ted Cruz of being "worse than Hillary"  over loans he received from his wife's employer, Goldman Sachs, and called the Texas senator "two-faced." 
Trump asked attendees, "what's he going to do be rough on Goldman Sachs when he's got a personal guarantee for a million dollars?" He attacked Cruz's Canadian birth as well.

 Trump was clearly in high spirits, even go so far as to briefly praise the press before eventually referring to them as "disgusting." He said of Tuesday, when he enjoyed both the endorsement by Palin as well as Iowa's six-term Republican governor, Terry Branstad, attacking Ted Cruz, that it was "a good day for Trump." 
The event also marked the first time Trump spent the night in Iowa since announcing his candidacy. He told attendees of his first overnight stay in the Hawkeye State: "I had good steak last night."
With several hundred people packed into an empty office space in suburban Des Moines early in the morning, the crowd was more subdued and less boisterous than at typical Trump events.

 Trump: Cruz 'worse than Hillary'  
Trump really let Texas senator Ted Cruz, his closest competitor in Iowa, have it in a campaign appearance in the state this morning. 
Trump hit Cruz for not reporting a loan Cruz took from Goldman Sachs for his Senate campaign ("they own him"), and for "being a Canadian citizen" (Cruz dropped his Canadian citizenship last year).
Here's Trump:
He said with being a Canadian citizen, he said 'Well, I didn't know that.' How did he know that? Then he said, with the loans, 'Oh! I didn't know that.' Smart guy- he doesn't know that?
"That's worse than Hillary, when you think about it."

"She has just been meeting people at a coffee shop in Guthrie Center, a town of 1,500 people which is located 40 miles west of Des Moines," Adam reports:
There were around 15 people in attendance. Not all were committed supporters. She's going to need to convince a lot more than that because she is averaging 1.5% in the polls.
 Fiorina seems very pleasant. She shook hands with everyone. Including me. I told her I was a journalist. 
"Well I can still say hi," she said. "You're not the enemy. Well, sometimes you are."
 She then knocked over a glass of water, which could happen to anyone, I suppose, before beginning her speech. Fiorina talked about the need to take our country back. She said this a lot. There was also a sign behind her which said "take our country back".

 "When are we going to start doing big things again?" h e asked. He said the country did big things when he was a boy. (I don't know what "big things" are.) 
"We have to take our country back. We have to take our country back, " Fiorina responded. (I don't know what "taking our country back" means.)
You know why we're not doing big things? Because we have a government that is sucking the life out of this nation," she continued. "We can do big things again but we've got to take our country back."
She continued: "Of course we can do big things, we must do big things. Because this is a nation that in history has said yes, we're going to do things better, when other nations have said no." 
I still don't know what big things are. Or what taking our country back means. Maybe I'll find out later on.

 Clinton and Sanders go negative  
The kind of lazy exchange of attack and counter-attack between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders that has developed in the last two weeks may be about to get more vigorous, it appears.
 After midnight last night on Twitter  - always a promising way to start a sentence - Clinton went after Sanders for Sanders' discounting an endorsement earlier Tuesday of Clinton by Human Rights Campaign, the flagship LGBT advocacy group: 
enltrReally Senator Sanders? How can you say that groups like @PPact and @HRC are part of the "establishment" you're taking on? -H
- Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) January 20, 2016
But the attack has kind of a half-hearted feel to it? The swipe came as Clinton's numbers appeared truly to have tanked in New Hampshire, and as Sanders has been showing disturbing, for Clinton, strength in Iowa. A recent gold-standard Des Moines Register poll had her at only two points up in the state.
So what if she wins every SEC/ super-duper Tuesday primary on 1 March? Lose-lose is not a good look for Clinton, and no way to kick off a presidential run.
 Sanders has been hitting back, criticizing Clinton - although not by name - for taking hundreds of thousands of dollars in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs,  and for voting in favor of the Iraq war. When Clinton's camp released a letter Tuesday calling Sanders' foreign policy views "troubling" and "puzzling," Sanders responded forcefully:
"On the crucial foreign policy issue of our time, it turns out that Secretary Clinton - with all of her experience - was wrong and I was right," Sanders said.

David Brock, a pro-Clinton partisan mercenary, also reportedly told New York magazine that Sanders was " a socialist... not a Democrat... He has a 30-year history of associating with some wackadoodle [eccentric, fanatical] ideas."
Will we have the pleasure of hearing Hillary Clinton go after Bernie Sanders for being a socialist? Stay tuned.

 A 25-year-old volunteer for the Ben Carson campaign, Braden Joplin, died from injuries sustained on Tuesday when a van carrying him and other volunteers skidded on ice and flipped.
 "I had the privilege of knowing Braden Joplin personally, and am filled with a deep and profound sadness at his passing," said Carson, who temporarily suspended campaign activities, in a statement. He continued:
The outpouring of support for Braden and his family from fellow candidates, as well as their staffs and volunteers, demonstrates that life will always transcend politics, and I thank them for their kind words. Please continue to keep Braden's family and friends in your prayers as they struggle through this difficult time.

But I find solace in the knowledge of God's redeeming grace, and I pray that Braden's family finds comfort in the mercy of the Lord.

 Hillary Clinton does not need to win New Hampshire on 9 February to cinch the Democratic presidential nomination.
And her campaign can file that fact under "fortunately," because in a poll released late Tuesday, Clinton rival Bernie Sanders appeared to be totally obliterating her in the Granite State. 
27 points! Even if Clinton does not "need" New Hampshire, a loss that big (and the poll could be an outlier; the averages have him up by "only" 11) would raise questions about just how excited Democrats are to nominate her.

 Clinton emails said to include top secret documents  
Meanwhile, yonder where the FBI is investigating the candidate with perhaps the best shot at becoming the next president - well, that investigation appears to be doing the opposite of going away.
NBC News reports that it has gained access to a letter to lawmakers in which an internal intelligence watchdog says that "some of Clinton's emails contained information classified Top Secret/Special Access Program, a secrecy designation that includes some of the most closely held U.S. intelligence matters." 
It had not previously been reported that Clinton's server may have handled information classified at such high levels. It's a big deal because, as you may recall, Clinton was using a personal email account to handle that allegedly Top Secret material, and a personal server, and the whole setup appears to have been seriously sketchy as far as operational security goes.
Did Hillary Clinton  recklessly expose big government secrets by using an email setup meant to shield her work from public scrutiny? That's what Republicans are saying.

 Welcome  
Hello, and welcome to our live-wire coverage of the 2016 presidential election, which historians will remember as "kooky".  
Kooky for the unusual strength of multiple outsider candidates; kooky for the inversion of the supposed rules of political speech; kooky for the failure (so far) of the Republican party to assert its will; kooky for the proliferation of kooky moments such as Ben Carson saying the pyramids are grain bins and Donald Trump impugning entire religions and nationalities - and then winning serious major-party support for it.
What country does he think this is ? Apparently he knows it pretty well.
Only a fool would declare, so early in such a political season, that a high-water mark for garish splendor, or anything else, had been reached. So we will resist the temptation to say that about what went down in Ames, Iowa, last night.
It was just kind of... kooky. Sarah Palin endorsed Donald Trump for president. Why not? "Heads are spinnin'! Media heads are spinnin'!" she said. Guilty!

Men in Northern Ireland blackmailed in online sex scam; 
Blackmailers using sex tapes to extort money from victims in Newtownabbey, Carrickfergus and Antrim, say police.

Henry McDonald Ireland correspondent.

A number of men in Northern Ireland who were filmed performing sex acts have been targeted by blackmailers. 
A spokesman for the Police Service of Northern Ireland said there had been several local reports of cyber-related blackmail relating to men in Newtownabbey, Carrickfergus and Antrim. 
Later the police said that there were up to 62 victims over a seven month period who had been targets of the scammers. 
The scam involved men being encouraged to film sex acts by blackmailers who then threatened to publish the footage on the internet. The PSNI said victims were told to pay into a Western Union bank account in west Africa or the recordings would be published on social networks.
DS Neil Maxwell said: "In the most recent cases, men of various ages have been asked to perform or participate in a sexual act online, which is recorded and then used to blackmail the individual with threats to upload the material on to social media platforms.
"Some victims have paid money because they have felt embarrassed and this usually involves a Western Union transfer to an account in the Ivory Coast. We want anyone who has been the victim of this type of crime to come forward. Do not feel pressurised into paying money as this is unlikely to resolve the issue," the officer added.
A teenager in the region killed himself in June after what his family described as a "relentless" campaign of online bullying by a Nigerian gang.
Ronan Hughes, 17, from County Tyrone, was duped into posting intimate photos online after receiving pictures of a girl. He was then blackmailed for £3,000 by the gang who threatened to upload the images to his friends' Facebook pages.

 Ta-Nehisi Coates, whose 2015 Between the World and Me won a National Book Award, has sharply criticized Vermont senator Bernie Sanders over the candidate's opposition to reparations for slavery,  writes the Guardian's Lauren Gambino:
Asked during Fusion's Black and Brown forum last week if he would be in favor reparations, Sanders replied: "No, I don't think so. First of all, its likelihood of getting through Congress is nil. Second of all, I think it would be very divisive." 
    "Divisive." Photograph: Jim Young/Reuters    
Coates, whose 2014 Atlantic magazine cover story The Case for Reparations stoked a broad discussion about race and justice in America, writes in a new Atlantic piece that Sanders's opposition to reparations was ironic, given the improbability of Sanders's own candidacy:
"The spectacle of a socialist candidate opposing reparations as "divisive" (there are few political labels more divisive in the minds of Americans than socialist) is only rivaled by the implausibility of Sanders posing as a pragmatist" Coates writes.
Sanders's "radicalism" when it comes to taking on the billionaire class and Wall Street, Coates adds, had "failed in the ancient fight against white supremacy".

Republican candidates Marco Rubio  and John Kasich have been pitching to the New Hampshire House of Representatives, who earn just $100 a year, the Guardian's David Smith reports from Concord, New Hampshire: 
Rubio, the Florida senator, recalled how financial hardship 15 years ago led him to kneel in church to pray for guidance and taught him lessons about public service. The main thrust of his speech was to contrast the nobility of local politics with the government industrial complex of Washington.
"Before me sits the largest state legislature in the country, meaning you each represent, on average, just a few thousand people - many of whom you know not from campaigning, but from childhood, from the checkout line at the grocery store, from church or school board meetings," he said, speaking under a portrait of George Washington in the oldest chamber in the US still in continuous legislative use.
    Marco makes 'em smile. Photograph: Jim Cole/AP   
"One truth I know is that independence runs in your veins. 'Live free or die. ' That call to action inspires and echoes through the generations. If Washington encroaches on our states, we will forfeit much of what makes us different, and special, and unique from all the nations on the earth."
Apart from a swipe at Barack Obama, whom he accused of trying to control the economy, healthcare and "even the weather", Rubio s teered clear of the darker tone he has adopted of lat e but, trailing conservative Ted Cruz, he was careful to reference God and the power of prayer more than once. "Despite everything going wrong in our country today, I believe with all my heart that God is not done with America yet."
Ohio governor Kasich, reportedly enjoying a surge in the New Hampshire polls, gave a less polished account of his life in politics but also appealed to anti-Washington sentiment, telling the House: "I believe in running our country from the bottom up."
    Those pictures are not going to turn out. Photograph: Jim Cole/AP   
He called for an overhaul of education policy and for bipartisan cooperation on issues such as combating drug addiction. "Our children are dying, our people are at risk... When we work together to solve problems, we leave a legacy, a legacy our children and grandchildren will remember."
Afterwards a local Rubio campaign staffer was upbeat, claiming that his "sincerity" is winning appeal wherever he goes. A Kasich operative shrugged off the polls, noting they have a habit of going up and down, and said Donald Trump is a "phenomenon" who will be in good shape if his success translates into votes.

Donald Trump this morning launched his most strident attack so far on Ted Cruz, but all the talk in Norwalk, Iowa, was about what didn't happen at the Republican frontrunner's campaign event, reports the Guardian's Ben Jacobs,  from the scene:
Despite promises of a special guest, which was featured on tickets and in emails to supporters, Sarah Palin didn't appear less than one day after she endorsed Trump in a rambling disjointed speech at a rally in Ames, Iowa. 
The Trump campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment about Palin's absence. 
However, Trump tweeted that the former Republican vice presidential nominee would appear at his event later in the afternoon in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Without Palin present, Trump accused  Ted Cruz of being "worse than Hillary"  over loans he received from his wife's employer, Goldman Sachs, and called the Texas senator "two-faced." 
Trump asked attendees, "what's he going to do be rough on Goldman Sachs when he's got a personal guarantee for a million dollars?" He attacked Cruz's Canadian birth as well.

 Trump was clearly in high spirits, even go so far as to briefly praise the press before eventually referring to them as "disgusting." He said of Tuesday, when he enjoyed both the endorsement by Palin as well as Iowa's six-term Republican governor, Terry Branstad, attacking Ted Cruz, that it was "a good day for Trump." 
The event also marked the first time Trump spent the night in Iowa since announcing his candidacy. He told attendees of his first overnight stay in the Hawkeye State: "I had good steak last night."
With several hundred people packed into an empty office space in suburban Des Moines early in the morning, the crowd was more subdued and less boisterous than at typical Trump events.

 Trump: Cruz 'worse than Hillary'  
Trump really let Texas senator Ted Cruz, his closest competitor in Iowa, have it in a campaign appearance in the state this morning. 
Trump hit Cruz for not reporting a loan Cruz took from Goldman Sachs for his Senate campaign ("they own him"), and for "being a Canadian citizen" (Cruz dropped his Canadian citizenship last year).
Here's Trump:
He said with being a Canadian citizen, he said 'Well, I didn't know that.' How did he know that? Then he said, with the loans, 'Oh! I didn't know that.' Smart guy- he doesn't know that?

"She has just been meeting people at a coffee shop in Guthrie Center, a town of 1,500 people which is located 40 miles west of Des Moines," Adam reports:
There were around 15 people in attendance. Not all were committed supporters. She's going to need to convince a lot more than that because she is averaging 1.5% in the polls.
 Fiorina seems very pleasant. She shook hands with everyone. Including me. I told her I was a journalist. 
"Well I can still say hi," she said. "You're not the enemy. Well, sometimes you are."
 She then knocked over a glass of water, which could happen to anyone, I suppose, before beginning her speech. Fiorina talked about the need to take our country back. She said this a lot. There was also a sign behind her which said "take our country back".

After her speech she took questions. A gray-haired man put his hand up.

"We have to take our country back. We have to take our country back, " Fiorina responded. (I don't know what "taking our country back" means.)
You know why we're not doing big things? Because we have a government that is sucking the life out of this nation," she continued. "We can do big things again but we've got to take our country back."
She continued: "Of course we can do big things, we must do big things. Because this is a nation that in history has said yes, we're going to do things better, when other nations have said no." 
I still don't know what big things are. Or what taking our country back means. Maybe I'll find out later on.

 Hillary Clinton does not need to win New Hampshire on 9 February to cinch the Democratic presidential nomination.
And her campaign can file that fact under "fortunately," because in a poll released late Tuesday, Clinton rival Bernie Sanders appeared to be totally obliterating her in the Granite State. 
27 points! Even if Clinton does not "need" New Hampshire, a loss that big (and the poll could be an outlier; the averages have him up by "only" 11) would raise questions about just how excited Democrats are to nominate her.

 Clinton emails said to include top secret documents  
Meanwhile, yonder where the FBI is investigating the candidate with perhaps the best shot at becoming the next president - well, that investigation appears to be doing the opposite of going away.
NBC News reports that it has gained access to a letter to lawmakers in which an internal intelligence watchdog says that "some of Clinton's emails contained information classified Top Secret/Special Access Program, a secrecy designation that includes some of the most closely held U.S. intelligence matters." 
It had not previously been reported that Clinton's server may have handled information classified at such high levels. It's a big deal because, as you may recall, Clinton was using a personal email account to handle that allegedly Top Secret material, and a personal server, and the whole setup appears to have been seriously sketchy as far as operational security goes.
Did Hillary Clinton  recklessly expose big government secrets by using an email setup meant to shield her work from public scrutiny? That's what Republicans are saying.

 Welcome  
Hello, and welcome to our live-wire coverage of the 2016 presidential election, which historians will remember as "kooky".  
Kooky for the unusual strength of multiple outsider candidates; kooky for the inversion of the supposed rules of political speech; kooky for the failure (so far) of the Republican party to assert its will; kooky for the proliferation of kooky moments such as Ben Carson saying the pyramids are grain bins and Donald Trump impugning entire religions and nationalities - and then winning serious major-party support for it.
What country does he think this is ? Apparently he knows it pretty well.
Only a fool would declare, so early in such a political season, that a high-water mark for garish splendor, or anything else, had been reached. So we will resist the temptation to say that about what went down in Ames, Iowa, last night.
It was just kind of... kooky. Sarah Palin endorsed Donald Trump for president. Why not? "Heads are spinnin'! Media heads are spinnin'!" she said. Guilty!

Will he give her a cabinet position in the future Trump administration? "Certainly, she could play a position if she wanted to," he told NBC, adding to Fox News: "It would be something I certainly would think about."

BBC's Jimmy Savile abuse report to be published in next six weeks; 
Dame Janet Smith's inquiry was set up in October 2012, but publication of its report has been subject to a string of delays.

Mark Sweney.

The report into sexual abuse at the BBC is to be published within the next six weeks, after police finally ruled that it will not prejudice any ongoing investigations.
Dame Janet Smith's inquiry was set up in October 2012 in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal, but publication of its report has been subject to a string of delays.  
Last May, the police stepped in to halt publication, saying that it could prejudice its own investigations.
"The review has been informed by the Metropolitan police that it is no longer concerned that publication of the report could prejudice its ongoing investigations," said a statement on behalf of the review. "The review is carrying out final checks in advance of delivery to the BBC and publication. Publication should take place within six weeks."
Smith's inquiry contacted more than 775 people and interviewed 375 witnesses in the Savile investigation and more than 100 in the inquiry into Stuart Hall. 
Members of the review visited the court during Hall's trial and also visited the Shepherd's Bush Empire, which was owned by the BBC, and Television Centre.
Smith's inquiry is expected to uncover hundreds of victims targeted by Savile and reveal a culture of ignorance which protected him. 
Later revelations about Hall, jailed in 2013 after pleading guilty to a string of child abuse charges, prompted the BBC to announce a related inquiry, led by former high court judge Dame Linda Dobbs, which will feed into the Smith review.
The review has been investigating whether BBC bosses were or ought to have been aware of inappropriate sexual conduct on its premises.
In a statement following the announcement, the BBC said: "We welcome the review's statement today and look forward to receiving the report. A publication date will be announced when the report is delivered to us."

Fifa and IAAF ride aboard a gravy train where normal rules do not apply; 
Tennis came under the spotlight this week but sport's terminally compromised governing bodies are forever forming a disorderly queue to regain the attention.

Marina Hyde.

With arriviste scandals like IAAF corruption and tennis fixing threatening to steal its thunder, Fifa is forced into amusing acts of attention-seeking. It's a bit like when Madonna feels she has to cop off with Justin Bieber or someone at the MTV awards. Excruciating, yet somehow mesmeric.
This week's limelight-stealing news is that despite being banned from world football for eight years, Sepp Blatter is still being paid to run it. According to a statement from Fifa's auto-parodic audit and compliance committee, the Swiss is still taking his president's salary - popularly estimated at in excess of $6m - and will carry on doing so until a new president is elected. Well, you have to hand it to him. (If you don't, he'll take it off you anyway.) Perhaps needless to say, Michel Platini is also being paid by Uefa, despite also having been banned from football for eight years. 
The one thing that has been stopped is Blatter's bonus, says the Fifa audit committee, which never tires of pointing out that it is all about transparency. When asked how much of Blatter's remuneration is bonus-based, it didn't want to say. When asked last week why the former Fifa general secretary JÈrÙme Valcke had been summarily sacked, it didn't want to say. I imagine if you asked what the point of Fifa was, it would decline to comment at this time.
So on it sails, just another of the terminally compromised sporting bodies infecting those others on whom the jury is still out. Even at this stage of the revelations about tennis, I dare you to say Tennis Integrity Unit without reflexively deploying sarcastic air quotes. Sarcastic air quotes are tearing through sport like a contagion. I think it's fair to say we're going to struggle to resuscitate "the IAAF ethics commission". And only the very optimistic can be holding out a lot of hope for the soon-to-be established "IAAF integrity unit".
However that one shapes up, it will have to go some way to beat my current favourite integrity unit. This honour is strongly held by the International Centre for Sport Security, a body set up to push for greater transparency in the bidding processes for major sporting events, and to safeguard the integrity of sport. If you like the sound of it, you're going to love the fact that it is literally funded by - you guessed it - the government of Qatar. I know!
Actually, the head honcho of the ICSS gets massively upset if people mention the connection. "The Qatar government has nothing to do with it at all," fumes this Mohammed Hanzab. "It is true that it is 70% funded by the Qatar government" - do go on - "and 30% is funded through projects we run... I have said to many people: 'If you can secure me the 70% from other governments, from other foundations, then I will be happy, as I will be a free man and I will not face this question wherever I go.'"
I really feel for him. It's like the ICSS is so close to credibility it can almost smell it. As for other governments that may pony up, has he given Moscow a call? Without wishing to go out on a limb here, instinct suggests there could be money for this sort of thing that-a-way.
Despite what could be regarded as a nagging credibility problem, the ICSS looks very busy - though not with what we may tactfully classify as matters "close to home". Primarily what members of bodies like this appear busy with is trashing the various other units and bodies. This week saw one ICSS executive emerge to sniff about the IAAF's procedures. "It's really giving keys to the inmates," she ruled. To reiterate: she works for a body apparently set up to secure "a self-cleaning culture" in sporting integrity that is funded by the Qatar government, which last year hosted more than 40 international sporting events, and has been under sustained suspicion for its 2022 World Cup bid, to say nothing of the human rights complaints against the country and the staggering death toll amongst migrant workers building the infrastructure for its events.
In such a looking glass world, it is perhaps no wonder the International Olympic Committee is these days held up as the apogee of impeccable sports governance, despite a welter of obvious and systemic flaws, such as its increasing tendency to award hosting rights to authoritarian regimes that blatantly manipulate the IOC for political purposes. Athletes who use the Games to make political points are given draconian punishments; presidents who use them as the curtain raiser to annexe the Crimea are positively encouraged. The IOC was among the swiftest out of the traps to throw itself into sympathetic relief against the Fifa scandal - more in sorrow than in anger, naturally.
I wonder what the population of international sports bodies is, flying governance class from job to job, even as the idea of integrity in sport appears to recede hourly? Stuffed with retired policemen, former Fifa ethics committee members, erstwhile IOC members, graduates of the second-tier Wada departments, they are a globalised micronation of people to whom normal rules never really seem to apply, who never regard themselves as responsible when anything goes wrong and whose rush to comment waspishly on whichever of their counterparts are in the spotlight this week is comically shameless. It may seem a noble journey to those on it but to anyone ordinary it is gravy train - though I'm sure its passengers would find gravy frightfully infra dig. Call it a jus train, then, but hold off wishing it bon voyage.

In filthy, dangerous accommodation, Britain's hidden homeless are suffering; 
IPPR researchers spoke to the people who end up in hostels, bedsits and temporary housing about the appalling conditions, abuse and theft.

Bill Davies.

While the housing and planning bill going through parliament offers much to prospective homeowners, those in the most urgent housing need are left with crumbs. 
For two years, the Institute for Public Policy Research has been talking to homeless people living in what we are calling unsupported temporary accommodation. These hidden homeless are mostly single homeless people ineligible for full formal housing support, who are sent towards the most dreadful corners of the English housing market: poor quality bed and breakfast accommodation, private hostels and short-stay shared houses.
 Related:  The scandal of councils turning away the homeless is finally being exposed 
The individuals who took part in our research ended up living there through a number of routes: some were directed from prison; many by local authorities unable to offer statutory support; others by local public services or charities; and even one by a taxi driver who knew that a bed would be available.
What was clear from the research was that there was no collective knowledge across authorities, agencies and voluntary services about who they were sending to these houses, what condition the properties were in, and little to no collective responsibility for these individuals once they had found somewhere to temporarily rest their heads.
Knowing where homeless people are sent to live matters. The physical and social conditions of where single homeless people end up are often appalling, and the tales of those living in these homes are often horrendous. One individual we interviewed said:
 It is a dump ... The quilt is just covered, soaked in blood. You have never seen anything like it. No heating. One person says [the landlord] has done nothing to maintain the place in 10 years. It is just so disgusting. I have been there just 24 hours and I am sleeping in all my clothes, my coat. Wrapped up and not touching anything. I have a scarf over my mouth so I don't breathe any disease in. 
The appalling property conditions are often coupled with reports of management abuse, theft, fraud, and social conditions that are unfit to live in. While properties might offer shelter, a number of individuals we worked with clearly stated that they would be better off on the street. The experiences we heard help to explain why this might be the case: individuals trying to gain stability or turn their lives around often find their accommodation making things worse - recovering addicts directed to houses where drug issues are known to be rife, vulnerable people signposted to homes with violent management and tenants.
While the causes of homelessness are dependent on any number of complex issues, common to individual stories was the lack of control over their journey in and out of these dwellings, and an experience of a wider homelessness system that is reluctant to take responsibility for single homeless people, or to provide them with a plan to help them move into a settled tenancy.
 Related:  Homeless people are not cockroaches or vermin - they are human and have rights
Increasing the supply of homes, and reviewing how single homeless people are treated in the housing system, will clearly be pivotal to providing better support and settled accommodation for these vulnerable individuals. But in the short-term much can be achieved to improve the lives of those locked out of the housing market and left behind by public policy.
First and foremost, local authorities should establish temporary accommodation boards to get a grip on the problem. These boards will bring together the existing activities of neighbouring housing authorities, public services and the homelessness sector. Member organisations would work collectively to gather, maintain and monitor information about local bedspaces and the individuals living in them, and to exchange information about the availability and quality of where single homeless people are being sent. This should be made available to potential tenants so they know what their options are.
Second, the boards should use feedback from partners and tenants to take tough enforcement action on the worst properties via local authority environmental health teams, and work with police and fire services to resolve the safety and security issues in the accommodation. Any properties not meeting local standards should be fined, and management transferred to organisations capable of looking after vulnerable people.
Third, the boards should work with tenants and the homelessness support sector to develop move-on plans, using private rented sector access schemes where necessary and working with local housing providers to identify settled housing and ongoing support for tenants, so that the problems that single homeless people face can be overcome, rather than made worse.
Ultimately, the UK is a wealthy state with access to significant resources. As well as judging governments on how successfully they tackle falling home ownership, we should judge them on how they treat its most vulnerable citizens, not least how they treat the hidden homeless.

The arrogant NHL: tone-deaf and alienating its fans - for what?; 
The NHL got itself into a dumb fight over the all-star game, and then Gary Bettman kicked up a storm in Calgary. The league needs to reconsider its commitment to fans.

Colin Horgan.

It's become an annual tradition every spring that, when NHL commissioner Gary Bettman steps on the ice to present the Stanley Cup-winning team with its prize hardware, those fans present in the arena let fly an immense chorus of boos. It persists partly because of its longevity - it's done because it's always been done. This year, however, when that time comes, we might remember this past week as reason other than tradition to air grievances. For, the NHL has managed in a matter of days, thanks purely to its own arrogance, to throw itself into unnecessary scandal and alienate its fan base. 
The first issue was weeks in the making. Back in December, the NHL once again launched its online fan vote option for the January 31 all-star game in Nashville. Within 72 hours, John Scott, an enforcer from the Arizona Coyotes, led the voting tally. Scott's role is a dying one in what many term the "new" NHL, one that has altered its rules to emphasize speed, skill, and goal-scoring, thereby naturally weeding out the usually slower, less skilled guys who in past have been on the ice to physically stick up for the star players. In the last eight seasons, Scott has scored five goals, but racked up 521 penalty minutes. Not really all-star material. 
At first it looked like a quick gag internet users were playing on the NHL - skewering the idea that the contest (which this year features 3-on-3 games) is at all a serious affair. But as December turned to January, and Scott still led the voting table. Voting closed. Scott was still on top, the presumptive captain of the Pacific Division. Such was the case as recently as January 6, when a post on the all-star website noted that Scott "leads the veteran contingent" of Pacific players. By that time, Scott had morphed from merely a joke to a rallying point - people started to like the feel-good aspect of a story about a guy who otherwise would never share the all-star ice. He embraced the role, even creating T-shirts to hand out to his teammates that said: "Thanks for believing in me. Love always, The Captain."
The league, meanwhile, seemed baffled as to what to do about it all.
Then, suddenly, Friday, Scott was traded to Montreal, in the Atlantic Division, which in turn almost immediately assigned him to their American Hockey League affiliate in St John's. Later that same day, TSN's Bob McKenzie tweeted that Scott was "previously asked by both NHL and Arizona Coyotes to bow out of NHL all-star game. He refused. Trade likely takes care of that."
Not quite. On Tuesday, the league announced Scott would be allowed to take part in the all-star game. But surely nobody can really be happy about how all this went - and the divisions it sowed.
Hockey Night in Canada's Don Cherry pointed the finger at the fans for ruining everything. "You jerks who put him up to be in the all-star game, you've taken this kid who was doing pretty good ... with an NHL contract, what you've done is put him in the minors and he's making American League money," Cherry scolded.
But he's in the minority. The more popular opinion is that the NHL deep-sixed Scott out of malice. "The NHL failed Scott," Pat Iversen wrote in a widely shared SB Nation post. "They took a surprisingly heartwarming moment and story for the sport and obliterated it out of pettiness and pride for a fake hockey game."
This last point is crucial. This is an event for which Alexander Ovechkin once wore sunglasses and a silly hat with a flag pointing out of it. The all-star game is meant to be for children, not to be run by adults acting like them.
It's possible the Machiavellian machinations that dropped Scott in the AHL were not wholly constructed by the NHL, and not meant as a slight to fans. But it looks bad. And coming as it does on the heels of yet Bettman's visit to Calgary earlier in the week, it starts to look like the NHL has forgotten its followers.
Out in Calgary, the Flames are still playing in the Saddledome, which is pushing its third decade as the team's home rink. As other teams have done, the Flames organization has proposed a new arena/football field hybrid stadium to be build on the west side of the downtown core. The land in question used to host a rail yard, and the contaminated soil has meant it's been underused (there's a bus station and a few car dealerships) for some time. The catch, however, is the price tag: $890m - much of which would be funded by taxpayers.
For Bettman, the proposal is a winner, and the stakes could not be higher. In the city last week, he told a business group that "it is not an overstatement to say the future stability, viability and continuity of the Calgary Flames, and perhaps the city of Calgary, rests on the achievement of CalgaryNEXT."
It was stunningly tone-deaf. Calgary - and Alberta, generally - is currently smarting from plummeting oil prices: jobs are being cut, house prices are falling, food banks are struggling to keep up with demand, and suicide rates are climbing. This is not a region that's ready to hear threats that nearly a billion dollars is needed to save its beloved hockey club. It's why many applauded Calgary mayor Naheed Nenshi's sarcastic rebuttal: "I know that Calgarians require very wealthy people from New York to come and tell us what we need to do in our community, because they understand vibrancy better than we do."
The NHL has long perpetuated a sentimentality-based marketing strategy - a brand of sports nostalgia based on the values of determination and teamwork. With the help of its broadcasting partners, it spins yarns about humble origins and family and local hockey arenas as second homes. There is some truth to all that of course, which is why it's believable, but it's exploited all the same.
Most importantly, the NHL promotes hockey, the sport, as a stand-in for community - which is what these two episodes are ultimately all about. That's how it makes its money. That's how it convinces families to pay exorbitant fees for tickets and merchandise, and to keep filling the system with young players. That's how it, a relatively small major league, still survives.
In the span of a single week, the NHL has left fans wondering if this is still a community they want to be a part of. Gary Bettman might expect a louder chorus of boos this spring, and if that's the case, he should take it as comfort. Boos imply people still care.

Men in Northern Ireland blackmailed in online sex scam; 
Blackmailers using sex tapes to extort money from victims in Newtownabbey, Carrickfergus and Antrim, say police.

Henry McDonald Ireland correspondent.

A number of men in Northern Ireland who were filmed performing sex acts have been targeted by blackmailers. 
A spokesman for the Police Service of Northern Ireland said there had been several local reports of cyber-related blackmail relating to men in Newtownabbey, Carrickfergus and Antrim. 
The scam involved men being encouraged to film sex acts by blackmailers who then threatened to publish the footage on the internet. The PSNI said victims were told to pay into a Western Union bank account in west Africa or the recordings would be published on social networks.
DS Neil Maxwell said: "In the most recent cases, men of various ages have been asked to perform or participate in a sexual act online, which is recorded and then used to blackmail the individual with threats to upload the material on to social media platforms.
"Some victims have paid money because they have felt embarrassed and this usually involves a Western Union transfer to an account in the Ivory Coast. We want anyone who has been the victim of this type of crime to come forward. Do not feel pressurised into paying money as this is unlikely to resolve the issue," the officer added.
A teenager in the region killed himself in June after what his family described as a "relentless" campaign of online bullying by a Nigerian gang.
Ronan Hughes, 17, from County Tyrone, was duped into posting intimate photos online after receiving pictures of a girl. He was then blackmailed for £3,000 by the gang who threatened to upload the images to his friends' Facebook pages.

Argentina's president: 'I will try to start a new kind of relationship' with the UK; 
President Mauricio Macri signals apparent thawing of bilateral relations over Falkland Islands as he bids to make Argentina more centrist in world affairs.

Jonathan Watts in Buenos Aires.

Argentina's President Mauricio Macri said he wants to start a "new kind of relationship" with Britain over the Falkland Islands as he tries to move his country towards a centrist position in world affairs. 
The outreach over the disputed territories was one of several international fence-mending plans outlined by the leader of South America's third-most populous country in his first interview with the foreign media since taking office last month. 
The charm offensive - which has contrasted with domestic accusations of an authoritarian streak - came on the eve of his visit to the Davos world affairs forum, another first for an Argentinian president in more than a decade. In Switzerland, Macri will meet the UK prime minister, David Cameron, in an apparent thawing of bilateral relations that soured under his predecessor, Cristina Fern·ndez de Kirchner.

In 1982, the two countries fought a two-month war over the islands, which are claimed by Argentina, where they are known as Las Malvinas. Under Fern·ndez de Kirchner, they were a frequent source of tension. 
Macri said he would continue to press Argentina's claim to sovereignty, but he hoped the mood of dialogue could change. 
"We'll continue with the claim but I will try to start a new type of relationship," he said. Pressed whether this would mean more trade, better transport links and other changes requested by the islanders, he avoided specifics. "I want to sit down and start talking about the subject and in the meantime find in which ways we can cooperate." 
The conciliatory tone was evident throughout the one-hour interview in the presidential office with the Guardian, Le Monde, El PaÌs and La Stampa. The meeting with the press was itself a sign of potential change. In eight years, Fern·ndez de Kirchner gave very little access to the foreign media.
Macri said he planned to use "all means available to communicate" - already evident on his Facebook page, which became wildly popular after he posted a picture of his dog Balcarce sitting on the presidential chair. 
The president, a former Buenos Aires mayor, looked a little uncomfortable, though this may have been more to do with his health. He was on painkillers after cracking a rib, reportedly while playing with his daughter the previous week. He also wore a scarf as he had a cold. 
But the scion of one of Argentina's elite families - who bears a striking resemblance to the actor Peter Capaldi - made it clear that he was out to woo international capital ahead of his trip to Davos with an open-for-business message. 
He expressed satisfaction that the economy had adapted rapidly to a sharp currency devaluation, reiterated his desire to reach a deal with hold-out foreign creditors - better known during the Kirchner era as "vulture funds" and targeted a single-digit inflation rate "in the next few years".
"We have to be a predictable and trustworthy country. We have to show investors that their rights will be respected, as well as we'll demand that they obey Argentina's laws," he said. "Argentina wants to have a good relationship with the whole world." 
The victory of Macri's pro-business campaign last November has been seen as part of a wider rightward shift in Latin American politics along with a crushing parliamentary defeat for Nicol·s Maduro's United Socialist party in Venezuela and the dire popularity of Brazil's Workers party president, Dilma Rousseff. The new Argentinian leader, however, was reluctant to identify himself as part of a new movement.
"I'm focused on giving Argentinians better opportunities. If what we are doing here helps the region, all the better," Macri said. "I don't want to get involved in what's going on in other countries. I try to build better relationships with them and work together with all the countries of the region. The only situation that I can't be in favour of is the lack of respect to human rights in Venezuela." 
The international olive branch contrasts, however, with the tougher line Macri adopted on the domestic battles he is fighting to curb the lingering influence of his predecessor and her Peronist bloc.
Macri said a key legacy project of his predecessor's - the $5.7bn NÈstor Kirchner hydroelectric dam planned for construction in Patagonia with Chinese funding - was being reviewed and alternatives were being considered, though he stressed that he wanted to continue strategic relations with Beijing.
Despite aiming for "zero poverty", the first month of the government has seen lay-offs of more than 10,000 state workers, many of them Peronists. Macri said more job losses were likely in what he described on several occasions as a "normalising" of the economy. 
"The previous administration used the state to appoint its supporters instead of people that were capable of doing that work. We are moving forward to a state close to the people that can solve the people's problems." 
Opponents say he is heavy-handed to the point of authoritarianism. During the interview, demonstrators outside the Casa Rosada protested the jailing of prominent indigenous leader, Milagros Sala. 
Social movements say the political activist was arrested for taking part in a month-long rally against Macri and funding cuts for civic groups. Her jailing, they say, marks a worrying setback for democracy. Macri denies this, saying the decision was made by independent judges. 
The new president has also been criticised for bypassing congress with the use of presidential decrees to appoint supreme court judges and nullify a media law that aimed to reduce the power of the giant ClarÌn media conglomerate, which had supported Macri in the election. A former ClarÌn journalist has been appointed co-director of the Telam state news agency.
Macri has used five decrees in his first month compared with 76 by Fern·ndez de Kirchner in her eight years, 270 by her husband NÈstor in his four years, and 545 by Carlos Menem in his 10 years. The new president was unapologetic. 
"I'm using a constitutional tool, I'm not inventing anything. It can't be authoritarian if it's constitutional. I'm just starting, there have only been a few decrees. Come back when I've used over a hundred," he said. 
Far from interfering in other branches of government, Macri says he has made the courts more transparent and independent. 
He points to his decision to declassify documents related to the mysterious death of prosecutor Alberto Nisman a year ago. Nisman was found shot in his bathroom a day before he was due to testify in Congress against Fern·ndez de Kirchner, but prosecutors have so far failed to ascertain whether it was suicide or murder. 
Macri, who recently met Nisman's family, said declassification and the granting of permission for judges to summon state security officials should help to resolve the case. "We made all these changes looking forward to a different result. If there was some political interference, there's not any more. We want to solve it," he said. 
He has other goals. Formerly a successful president of Boca Juniors, he wants to reform Argentina's scandal-plagued football administration and mount a bid to co-host the 2030 World Cup with Uruguay. But more than this or the Falklands, the biggest challenge to what he calls "normalising" Argentina is likely to come from the fundamentally Peronist character of the nation. 
Outside the country's various military dictators, no non-Peronist president has finished a term of office in more than 50 years as a result of union opposition and street protests.
Asked whether he would like to be remembered as the president who bucks that historic trend, Macri replied: "Wait and see."

 The Guardian's David Smith trailed Ted Cruz in New Hampshire today, where the Texas senator juggled Star Wars fans and Bible thumping primary voters in the same afternoon - and pledged to hold a pig roast on the White House lawn: Ted Cruz has been showing his protean talents in New Hampshire, first quipping about Hollywood movies with students at a university campus, then referencing the Bible with a working-class audience in a pizza joint.

The Texas senator was presented with a $5 plastic lightsaber by Andrew Slack, 36, a civic activist and self-described "director of the US rebel alliance". Cruz, himself a Star Wars fan, played along. He said Han Solo was the coolest character in cinema and anyone who believes Luke Skywalker is instead should be disqualified from running for president.
But he disappointed Slack by refusing to take a "Jedi pledge" to "blow up the Death Star" of Citizens United, the supreme court's 2010 ruling that allowed corporations and unions to spend unlimited money on campaigning and ushered in the rise of Super Pacs.
Cruz said it was a matter of free speech, explaining: "I think Michael Moore's movies are idiotic. But he's got a first amendment right to keep making idiotic movies."
Asked whom he would invite to a fantasy dinner party, Cruz mentioned Jesus Christ, Ronald Reagan, Winston Churchill, Martin Luther King and Elvis Presley. He also promised to hold a pig roast on the south lawn of the White House.
Afterwards he told journalists the Republican establishment is defecting from Marco Rubio to Donald Trump because of the latter's willingness to cut deals. "The establishment is saying the one guy who scares the heck out of us is Cruz, because Cruz will actually stand with the American people against the career politicians in both parties that get in bed with the lobbyists and special interests."
Trump has previously been a donor to the Clinton Foundation and supported Clinton and other leading Democrats, Cruz added. "Every day he is engaging in more and more personal attacks. I have no intention of responding. I like Donald Trump, I respect Donald Trump, I will continue to praise him personally, and so if he wants to engage in insults that's his prerogative. But I'm going to keep the focus on the issues of substance. I think policy distinctions are fair game."
The senator then made his way to Theo's pizza restaurant, which was standing-room only and in a more febrile mood. Cruz gave a bleaker account of the state of the nation, comparing it with Jimmy Carter's presidency in the 1970s but noting that this was followed by the glory years of Reagan and the timeworn "shining city on the hill".
He pledged to revoke Obama's executive orders and actions on gun control and other matters, launch an investigation into Planned Parenthood "and those horrible videos", protect religious liberty and " rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal ".
And that would just be his first day in office.
He would also move the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and "repeal every word of Obamacare". As for immigration, Cruz said slyly: "We're going to build a wall - and I got somebody in mind to build it." 
As placard-waving supporters voiced support, Cruz promised to defend the Supreme Court against a liberal majority of justices. Hillary Clinton, he warned, would seek to use it to tear down war memorials which would be "not so far" from removing crosses and stars of David from war graves.
He urged the crowd to pray for the nation and each encourage nine friends to vote for him on primary day. "Continue this awakening," he said.

The Guardian's Rupert Neate reports from the South Point resort and casino in Las Vegas, where billionaire frontrunner Donald Trump was stumping with the wind of two major polls at his back:
A lot of people came to see Donald Trump speak in a casino Las Vegas on Thursday, and he demanded the media take note of it. The leading Republican Presidential candidate called the press "scumbags at the back of the room" for, he said, consistently not showing the scale of the crowds that turn out to support his campaign rallies. 
enltrTrump, in brilliant pink tie, starts off by attacking the media as "scumbags". 'All they focus on is the protesters' pic.twitter.com/gjhlBwTGbv

At one point, Trump, who according to a new poll has captured a double-digit lead in Iowa a mere 11 days before the caucuses, halted his rambling speech until TV cameramen "turn around and show the crowd". "There's not been one shot of the crowd," he said. 
So many people (4,000, according to casino security) had turned out to see Trump speak that the casino opened up three overflow rooms to relay his speech on big screens. 
Many of those who turned out to see Trump had come from Shot Show, the gun industry trade show also being held in Las Vegas, and one of the biggest cheers came as the candidate pledged to "save the Second Amendment".
"You listen to Hillary, and you're not going to have a Second Amendment!"
Jerry Springer, 68, (yes his real name, I checked) was one of those who had taken a break from the gun fair to turn out for Trump. Even though not a big fan of Trump, Springer said he would support any Republican who can "take out Hillary". 
Springer, who wore a sticker on the back of his shirt reading "1.20.17 OBAMA'S LAST DAY IN OFFICE!", said Obama was "the worst president we have ever had".
"Why? He is changing this country away from what it was. He doesn't want people to pay for anything. He is giving away food stamps to everyone. He is making it so that people don't have to pay for anything, and it is people like us that have to pay for everything."

Trump, whose speech concentrated on his favourite topics of immigration, taxation and trade, said "we are being led by stupid people", and he wanted to lead the country to "make America great again". 
He had a lot of fans in the room, including Rhonda Settles, a small business owner who has lived in Vegas since 1975, said Trump was "awesome as usual". 
" The country is in a downward spiral, and Trump is the only one stepping up to the plate," she said. "He is the one we can believe he can make America great again. He has a proven record, even though not necessarily in politics."
Settles, who is African American, said she did not believe Trump was racist or prejudice, despite his description of Mexicans as criminals and rapists and his pledge to make Mexico pay for a wall along the border to prevent illegal immigration.
"Those were not negative [comments]," she said. "We have to protect our country, I don't think he has anything to do with prejudice or racism. It is about following the laws that exist, but the current government has not been following."
Settles conceded that Trump did not make any real promises in his 45 minute Vegas speech, but said: "We're at the point where we have to listen not to what they say but how they say it. Donald Trump is ringing true to a lot of people. I don't need to know every detail. I just need to trust him, and I do."
Sharon and Charles Wax, both in their eighties, are also strident Trump supports. "We think he's absolutely fabulous," said Sharon wearing a Trump hat, light-up bow tie and a t shirt showing her and Charles meeting Trump at a previous rally. "He thinks what Americans think, our country has gone down the tubes after eight years of Democrats. This is the only man who can bring trade back to America and, as he says, make America great again."

If Congress handed out superlatives at the end of every session - and if the continued drollery of the Miss America pageant is any indication, it should - Texas senator Ted Cruz would be in no danger of winning "Most Popular."
A new report from the Associated Press highlights Cruz's deep unpopularity within the US senate, calling him the "least-favorite colleague" of nearly every Republican senator. But the abhorrence for Cruz's personal politics and perceived grandstanding is giving way in the upper chamber to panic as members of the senate worry that Cruz's nomination could spell the end of the party's control of Congress.
   He came in like a wrecking ball...  
Orrin Hatch of Utah told the Associated Press that he has yet to see "any great desire on [Cruz's] part to really bring the party along with him, so that's something that worries me."
Representative Pete King of New York called Cruz a "fraud," saying that he couldn't name a single person in Washington "who gets this opposition from his own people.... I'm talking about people as conservative as he is who just can't stand him."
Richard Burr of North Carolina even reportedly told supporters at a campaign fundraiser that he would rather vote for socialist senator Bernie Sanders than Cruz. 
A few of the more glaring highlights that Cruz's detractors cite in their opposition:

Cruz implied that former senator Chuck Hagel had received compensation from North Korea during a confirmation hearing
His confrontation with the White House over the Affordable Care Act resulted in a 16-day government shutdown that Americans largely blamed on the Republican party
Last year, Cruz accused McConnell of lying about scheduling a vote on the Export-Import Bank in a speech on the senate floor
And who does the senate seem ready to crown as Miss Congeniality? Florida senator Marco Rubio, who has received the endorsement of four Republican members of the chamber.
Cruz has received none.

In Brooklyn, New York, the main industry is independent coffee shops and almond milk. In Brooklyn, Iowa, it is agriculture: corn, soy and fairy milk.
More than 2.5 million people live in Brooklyn, New York. Brooklyn, Iowa, has a population of 1,500 people. 
Oh - and in Brooklyn, New York, Bernie Sanders is wildly popular. Whereas in the Iowan Brooklyn, no one seems to like him very much.
"No," said Marcia Kilmer, 66, when I asked if she would be voting for Sanders. She was having her hair cut in Shear Expressions. "He's too old. I don't like his age." She likes Ted Cruz and Ben Carson.
"I do not, myself," said a woman in Brooklyn's pharmacy, when I asked if she liked Sanders.
"I'm not a big fan of spreading the wealth. I think you should get what you earn," said a man called Paul, when I asked him why he didn't like Sanders. Paul was sitting in Brooklyn's grocery store, Seaton's Flag Foods, with five friends. 
None of them supported Bernie Sanders.

 Reporting from the frosty snowfields of  Arendelle  Iowa, the Guardian's Ben Jacobs points out that the campaign's favorite pediatric neurosurgeon is well-protected - if not well supported:
Everyone remembers that Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have Secret Service protection - but a third candidate does as well.
Despite his precipitous fall in polls, Ben Carson still has Secret Service protection. The retired neurosurgeon was given Secret Service protection in November along with Trump, at a point when the two were still neck-and-neck in the polls. Secret Service protection is awarded based a mix of factors, including polling and the number of death threats received. Hillary Clinton has been entitled to a Secret Service detail since the start of the campaign and beyond, due to her status as a former first lady.
The result is a jarring juxtaposition as one arrives at a Carson event. Despite his diminishing standing in the polls and a crowd that is heavily composed of high school students eager for an excuse to leave class early, there are still agents in suits and earpieces alertly scanning the crowd and a magnetometer at the entrance to the event.

Vermont senator Bernie Sanders is becoming a bit of a cut-up on the campaign trail, to rave reviews from audiences, reports Washington Bureau chief Dan Roberts: 
One sign of growing confidence in the Bernie Sanders camp is his willingness to gently mock his reputation for quirky public speaking. In recent days we've had quips about his hair and dress sense that do much to endear him to young supporters, but today at Southern New Hampshire University he took on the reputation for giving lectures. "Let me a bit professorial here," said Sanders to laughter from the students. "Who knows the difference between real unemployment and official unemployment?", he asked, in an exchange that would not have been out of place in economics class.
The next assignment concerns the environment - a big theme here where Sanders was joined by campaigner Bill McKibben. "How does that relate to campaign finance?" asked the prof, before explaining his theory of the link between energy industry lobbying and climate change denial among Republicans.
 It's not all one way though. After he acknowledged being accused of "Santa Claus" tendencies, one student asks the six-million-dollar question about how Sanders can possibly achieve everything he is proposing. "What am I smoking, you mean?," he shot back to more laughter.
   A young Sanders supporter is in on the joke.  
(His answer, in case you were wondering, is that all radical change takes people by surprise.)

 More from the Cable News Network's polling apparatus... 
The same survey that showed Hillary Clinton with a devastating eight-point deficit in Iowa indicates additional good news for outsider candidates who are relatively new to their party of choice. Billionaire frontrunner Donald Trump holds a double-digit lead among likely Republican caucus-goers in the Hawkeye State, leading Texas senator Ted Cruz by eleven points, 37% to 26%. The survey, conducted earlier this week, finds Florida senator Marco Rubio in third place at 14%, the only other Republican candidate to hold double digits in the state.
Trump jumped four points since the same poll was conducted in late November/early December, while Cruz picked up six points. Fifty-four percent of likely Iowa voters see Trump as the most qualified candidate to handle the economy, and an outright majority of 51% say he's the best candidate on immigration. He even edges out Cruz on foreign policy, 27% to 25%, although among social conservatives, the Texas senator walks away with a leading 29% who are concerned about same-sex marriage and abortion.
Among the lower tier, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson "leads" with 6% - a quarter of the support he had among likely caucus-goers in October - with Jeb Bush and Mike Huckabee tied for fifth place at 3% each. Kentucky senator Rand Paul, who has put little energy in Iowa, is at 2%, while Chris Christie, Carly Fiorina, John Kasich and previous caucus-winner Rick Santorum each pull in only 1% support.
 Put another way: If supporters of the bottom eight candidates were to coalesce behind a single person, that candidate would be in third place.

 Hillary Clinton's latest Iowa poll numbers are borderline disastrous  
 CNN polls are officially on the Clinton hit list. 
With only 11 days to go before the Iowa caucuses, a new CNN/ORC poll released Thursday afternoon finds Vermont senator Bernie Sanders with an astonishing eight-point lead over Hillary Clinton in Iowa - 51% to 43%. It's a dramatic reversal of fortunes for the former secretary of state, who led Sanders by 18 points in the same poll last December, 54% to 36%.
The poll arrives on the heels of a CNN/WMUR poll released earlier this week that shows Sanders with a commanding 27-point lead in New Hampshire. A one-two loss in both Iowa, originally deemed safe Clinton territory, and New Hampshire could indicate an existential threat to the former secretary of state's candidacy.
 Key to Sanders' lead: voters who will be caucusing for the first time. Among Democrats who caucused in 2008, Clinton leads Sanders by a comfortable 17 points, 55% to 38%. The self-declared socialist can also credit his perceived authenticity on economic issues as a major factor in the surge in support. Likely caucus-goers told CNN that they trust Sanders over Clinton on the economy by 22 points - two in three surveyed said they felt he would do more for America's middle class. A mere 30% felt that way about Clinton.
It wasn't exclusively bad news for the former secretary of state, who leads on foreign policy among likely Iowa voters, viewed as more trustworthy on the issue by a margin of 40 points. Additionally, despite what appear to be massive weaknesses in early states, Clinton is seen as the candidate most likely to win the general election in November, 60% to 38%.

It may have flown under the radar, but an unexpectedly popular presidential candidate has picked up a huge (yuge?) endorsement from a vanguard of his adopted party's activist wing.
No, not Donald Trump. Obviously, you heard all about that endorsement.
 Vermont senator Bernie Sanders picked up the endorsement of The Nation, the oldest continuously published weekly magazine in the US and self-described "flagship of the left," earlier this month. Now, Katrina vanden Heuvel, The Nation's editor and publisher, has come out in an interview explaining the progressive magazine's decision to endorse a primary candidate for only the third time in its 150-year history.
"It is a statement of commitment to issues we believe in above all," said vanden Heuvel in the magazine's podcast Start Making Sense. Sanders, vanden Heuvel said, "lifts up, amplifies the issues that have animated The Nation over these last decades."
"The key issue... is inequality," she elaborated. "There are many kinds of inequality, but Bernie Sanders is an unbought and passionate fighter against a rigged system and metastasizing inequality, economic and political."
 "Above all, it was his commitment to exposing a rigged system" that prompted The Nation to give the self-declared socialist its endorsement in the Democratic primary.
An endorsement from The Nation is a rare event - the periodical has previously endorsed Ulysses S. Grant in 1868, Norman Thomas in 1943 and Franklin Delano Roosevelt in each of his four campaigns - and even rarer in a primary campaign. It's the second time that the magazine has endorsed Hillary Clinton's main rival in the Democratic primary, having bestowed the honor upon then-senator Barack Obama in 2008.
Listen to the full interview, in which vanden Heuvel (pronounced "VAN-din HOY-vul," in case you were stumped) praises Sanders' ability to raise millions almost exclusively from small donors, calling him "liberated" to pursue progressive policies without fear of political reprisal.

Despite some new polls showing Bernie Sanders ahead in New Hampshire by as much as 27 points, there is an air of realism at his first campaign stop since the latest surge captured headlines here, writes Guardian Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts: 
The meeting with seniors at the Peterborough community center reflected a conscious push by the campaign to bolster support among older voters, whose undeniable interest in the 74-year-old has been somewhat eclipsed by the more vocal enthusiasm Sanders generally receives from students and younger voters.
 "He cares about us older folks  - he is one of us you know," says Merry Stockwell, a volunteer who introduced the senator from neighbouring Vermont to this retirement community an hour or so north of Boston.
"I believe in what he is saying, I'm just not sure how much of it he is going to be able to achieve," said Ruth, a 68-year-old retired educator from the nearby town of Antrim, who is one of the many voters in the state still to make up their minds.
Though equally sceptical about Hillary Clinton - "Hillary has got a lot of baggage" - she shrugs when asked what might convince her that Sanders can realistically take on Republicans and win the White House.

 Clinton sends army of surrogates to Iowa  
There's probably no one in the race who could (literally, not figuratively) win a shouting match against Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, whose trademark is a full-throated tirade against the billionaire class, writes the Guardian's Lauren Gambino: 
But locked in a tight race with just days to go before voting begins, Hillary Clinton is dispatching  actors, athletes, musicians, politicians, activists and family members across the Hawkeye state to help her turn up the volume on the campaign trail.
In lieu of the former secretary of state, Iowans can catch Juli·n Castro, former mayor of San Antonio and secretary of Housing and Urban Development; actress and activists Jamie Lee Curtis; athlete and activist Billie Jean King;  Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund; Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York; Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia; Stephanie Schriock, President of EMILY's List; Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey; and Scandal actor Tony Goldwyn.

"We can get this done without another divisive debate about our entire health care system and without giving Republicans a window to tear down" what we've built. 
"Rather than build on the progress we've made," Clinton continues, "[Sanders] wants to start over from scratch with a whole new system.

The campaign of former governor Mike Huckabee has announced that the Republican candidate will be performing with  80's rock band FireHouse  at the Surf Ballroom in Clear Lake, Iowa, tomorrow night.
 "I'm thrilled about rocking-out with FireHouse  in one of the coolest music venues in the world," Huckabee says in a statement. "We want everyone to come out and join us for some great music and great times." 
It's strange that the Huckabee press release says the former governor will "shred base guitar" - as it's properly a bass guitar and not shreddable so much as slappable. Anyway this is FireHouse:
   When you're playing with fire you're bound to get burned.

The Guardian's Adam Gabbatt is on the trail in Iowa, where he checks in with some Nurses for Bernie - and prepares himself for a Demi Lovato performance in support of Clinton.
"I met up with some people from National Nurses United yesterday," Adam writes:
They've got themselves a big bus and they have been following Bernie Sanders  all over Iowa. They'll be trekking across the state until the caucuses on February 1.
Jean Ross is one of the organisation's co-chairs. She is from Minnesota. But she really likes Bernie so she has flown south for the winter.
She said the nurses have been signing people up for caucuses: "And basically explaining to them why the nation's most trusted profession supports Bernie ".
They're averaging about four cities a day. I told Ross that the schedule sounded exhausting. 
 "Have you every seen nurses work!?" she said.
Here's their bus, right behind Bernie's:

The Clinton camp is out with a new video in which foreign policy adviser Jake Sullivan picks apart what he says are flaws in rival Bernie Sanders' thinking on foreign policy. 
The video is a model of calm argumentation. Sullivan sits in a cubicle at what looks like campaign headquarters and speaks directly to camera. "I have the greatest respect for senator Sanders," he says, "but when you look at the rest of his ideas, they just don't make a lot of sense."  
The video follows the release on Tuesday of a letter sent by 10 former senior US diplomats and national security officials calling Sanders's foreign policy agenda "troubling" and "puzzling."
Sanders replied to the letter by pointing out that "on the crucial foreign policy issue of our time, it turns out that Secretary Clinton - with all of her experience - was wrong and I was right."

 Planned Parenthood: abortion will be 'defining issue'  
On the 43rd anniversary of Roe v Wade, Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richard s said there has never been a more important election for women's rights, writes the Guardian's Lauren Gambino: 
"There's never been an election in which Roe was more clearly on the ballot," Richards told reporters on Thursday. "I do think  it's going to be a defining issue  for voters all across the country."

At least one and as many as four supreme court appointments are likely to fall to the next president. A conservative majority could overturn Roe V Wade, the 1973 decision protecting a woman's right to choose.
"Young people in America cannot imagine, and are only now beginning to come to grips with the fact, that there are folks in this country who are either in elective office or are trying to get into elective office that would take away a right that has been the law of the land now for more than 40 years," Richards said. "It's been an enormous wake-up call."
Planned Parenthood has endorsed Hillary Clinton for president, the organization's first-ever primary endorsement in its century-long existence.
On Wednesday, Clinton's rival, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, deemed Planned Parenthood and the host of other liberal organizations and labor unions backing Clinton part of the "establishment".

Sanders said on MSNBC that his campaign is not only taking on Wall Street and the economic elite, but the "political establishment" as well.
"I have friends and supporters in the Human Rights Fund and Planned Parenthood," Sanders said, referring to two organizations that have endorsed Clinton. "But you know what? Hillary Clinton has been around there for a very, very long time. Some of these groups are, in fact, part of the establishment."
Clinton quickly hit back, defending Planned Parenthood: "I wish it were [establishment]. If it were part of the establishment, we wouldn't have to work so hard to protect it."

Donald Trump's lead in polling averages in New Hampshire is 20 points - but steadily strengthening s howings by Ohio governor John Kasich are creating buzz that he may have a shot in the Granite State.
    Momentum? In Concord Wednesday. Photograph: Darren McCollester/Getty Images   
"Kasich is banking on New Hampshire's peculiar primary rules, which allow independents to vote in the Republican primary," writes my colleague Scott Bixby. "His moderation is on full display during a week-long tour across bluer parts of the state - Kasich is stumping primarily in counties that Barack Obama won during the last presidential election. With 44% of the Granite State's voters registered as independents, Kasich has a huge (yuge?) opportunity with non-traditional GOP voters."
The  Kasich camp is out with a new ad i n which the candidate's wife, Karen Waldbillig, says, "We really need your help to keep this momentum going." It's a series of nice family scenes from the New Hampshire primary trail:

... frustration is mounting amid fears that the Republican party could tear itself apart, yet only Jeb Bush has attacked Trump head on.

You don't have much time."

Often described as pugnacious, Christie elicited audience laughter by replying: "You know, I think it's the first time in my political career that people have said to me you're not aggressive enough."
He went on: "Listen, you know when I will? When I think it makes sense to.  I'm not in this to just beat Donald Trump. I'm in this to become president of the United States and I'm going to make certain decisions about when I want to say what I'm going to say."

 Voters don't expect the nominating races to come out the way that current polling seems to indicate they may come out, writes Guardian US data editor Mona Chalabi. " Either Americans aren't watching polls or else they simply don't trust them," Mona writes:
A poll from Loras college this morning puts Donald Trump and Ted Cruz neck-and-neck, with just 1 percentage point separating them in Iowa. There's nothing particularly surprising about that finding - it's not far off the average across all Iowa polls, which has Trump at 28%, Cruz at 27% and Rubio trailing at 11%.
What's interesting though are the follow-up questions Loras included about expectations. When 1,000 likely 2016 caucus-goers were asked this month who they thought would win Iowa, 3 8% said Cruz while 29% said Trump.  
Those expectations were flipped for the national race, though, where 36% said they thought Trump would be the Republican nominee while only 21% thought Cruz would get the backing of the party.

On the Democrat side, a recent survey from YouGov points to a similar gap between expectations and polling data:  people think Sanders has much less of a chance in Iowa than polls suggest.  Overall, 51% expect Clinton to win Iowa and only 35% think Sanders can while polling averages suggest it will be a much closer race: 47% Clinton and 43% Sanders.

 Republican candidate Carly Fiorina has been accused of "ambushing" a group of children, after she ushered pre-schoolers, who were on a field trip to a botanical garden, into an anti-abortion rally in Des Moines, the Guardian's Adam Gabbatt reports: 
The alleged ambush occurred when Fiorina hosted a "right to life" forum at the Greater Des Moines botanical garden. Entering the rally, before a crowd of about 60 people, she directed around 15 young children towards a makeshift stage.

The problem, one parent said, was that the children's parents had not given Fiorina permission to have their children sit with her - in front of a huge banner bearing the image of an unborn foetus - while she talked about harvesting organs from aborted babies.
"The kids went there to see the plants," said Chris Beck, the father of four-year-old Chatham, one of the children Fiorina appeared with. "She ambushed my son's field trip."

Hello and welcome to our live-wire, minute-to-minute coverage of the 2016 presidential election. 
It's an interesting mix today, with Guardian reporters following Hillary Clinton and Ben Carson in Iowa, Donald Trump and Bill Clinton in Nevada and no fewer than four Republican candidates in New Hampshire - Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz. Democrat Bernie Sanders is also campaigning in the Granite State.
 In a new ad to air in Iowa, Sanders has gone full Simon & Garfunkel:
   America was released 48 years ago.  
Donald Trump dished last night on CNN on what it was like to stand next to Sarah Palin during the rambling 20-minute speech she gave to endorse him on Tuesday. 
 "I didn't know it was going to be quite that long,"  Trump said.
... but she made a beautiful, you know, she made a very good speech. No, I wasn't uncomfortable - I was very happy. I would have normally left the stage and let her speak ... I thought it would be disrespectful to her if I left the stage. So, no, I wasn't uncomfortable at all."
He doesn't look uncomfortable in this mashup:
Trump spent part of Wednesday hammering Texas senator Ted Cruz, seemingly his closest rival in Iowa, which votes in just 11 days' time. 
This morning it appears the Republican establishment has picked a horse in the Trump-Cruz race - and it is Trump.  Bob Dole, the former senator and presidential nominee, told the New York Times Republicans would suffer "cataclysmic" losses with Cruz and that Trump would be better.
 Trent Lott, the former Senate majority  leader, told the Atlantic he'd take Trump over Cruz if he had to choose. Trump himself pointed out that "Everybody dislikes [Cruz]. I mean, he's a nasty guy that everybody dislikes."
 Cruz hit back, saying there actually is a new alignment between Trump and the establishment - difficult to argue, except in the case of a Trump-Cruz race - and trying to use it against Trump.
"Right now the Washington establishment is  abandoning Marco Rubio, they made an assessment that Marco can't win this race, and the Washington establishment is rushing over to support Donald Trump," Cruz told Politico. 
We're seeing that happen every day and Mr Trump is welcoming the support of the Washington establishment.
In other news, Ben Carson resumes campaign activities today after the death on Tuesday of a volunteer, in a van crash.
At the state level, last night emails released to the public indicated that Michigan governor Rick Snyder was informed of water quality issues in the city of Flint as early as February 2015 but his administration struck a dismissive tone, saying the problems would eventually "fade in the rearview".

 The glitz! The glamour! The number of people called stupid! 
The Guardian's Rupert Neate reports from the South Point resort and casino in Las Vegas, where billionaire frontrunner Donald Trump was stumping with the wind of two major polls at his back:
A lot of people came to see Donald Trump speak in a casino Las Vegas on Thursday, and he demanded the media take note of it. The leading Republican Presidential candidate called the press "scumbags at the back of the room" for, he said, consistently not showing the scale of the crowds that turn out to support his campaign rallies.

At one point, Trump, who according to a new poll has captured a double-digit lead in Iowa a mere 11 days before the caucuses, halted his rambling speech until TV cameramen "turn around and show the crowd". "There's not been one shot of the crowd," he said. 
So many people (4,000, according to casino security) had turned out to see Trump speak that the casino opened up three overflow rooms to relay his speech on big screens. 
Many of those who turned out to see Trump had come from Shot Show, the gun industry trade show also being held in Las Vegas, and one of the biggest cheers came as the candidate pledged to "save the Second Amendment".
"You listen to Hillary, and you're not going to have a Second Amendment!"
Jerry Springer, 68, (yes his real name, I checked) was one of those who had taken a break from the gun fair to turn out for Trump. Even though not a big fan of Trump, Springer said he would support any Republican who can "take out Hillary". 
Springer, who wore a sticker on the back of his shirt reading "1.20.17 OBAMA'S LAST DAY IN OFFICE!", said Obama was "the worst president we have ever had".
"Why? He is changing this country away from what it was. He doesn't want people to pay for anything. He is giving away food stamps to everyone. He is making it so that people don't have to pay for anything, and it is people like us that have to pay for everything."

Trump, whose speech concentrated on his favourite topics of immigration, taxation and trade, said "we are being led by stupid people", and he wanted to lead the country to "make America great again". 
He had a lot of fans in the room, including Rhonda Settles, a small business owner who has lived in Vegas since 1975, said Trump was "awesome as usual". 
" The country is in a downward spiral, and Trump is the only one stepping up to the plate," she said. "He is the one we can believe he can make America great again. He has a proven record, even though not necessarily in politics."
Settles, who is African American, said she did not believe Trump was racist or prejudice, despite his description of Mexicans as criminals and rapists and his pledge to make Mexico pay for a wall along the border to prevent illegal immigration.
"Those were not negative [comments]," she said. "We have to protect our country, I don't think he has anything to do with prejudice or racism. It is about following the laws that exist, but the current government has not been following."
Settles conceded that Trump did not make any real promises in his 45 minute Vegas speech, but said: "We're at the point where we have to listen not to what they say but how they say it. Donald Trump is ringing true to a lot of people. I don't need to know every detail. I just need to trust him, and I do."
Sharon and Charles Wax, both in their eighties, are also strident Trump supports. "We think he's absolutely fabulous," said Sharon wearing a Trump hat, light-up bow tie and a t shirt showing her and Charles meeting Trump at a previous rally. "He thinks what Americans think, our country has gone down the tubes after eight years of Democrats. This is the only man who can bring trade back to America and, as he says, make America great again."

If Congress handed out superlatives at the end of every session - and if the continued drollery of the Miss America pageant is any indication, it should - Texas senator Ted Cruz would be in no danger of winning "Most Popular."
A new report from the Associated Press highlights Cruz's deep unpopularity within the US senate, calling him the "least-favorite colleague" of nearly every Republican senator. But the abhorrence for Cruz's personal politics and perceived grandstanding is giving way in the upper chamber to panic as members of the senate worry that Cruz's nomination could spell the end of the party's control of Congress.
   He came in like a wrecking ball...  
Orrin Hatch of Utah told the Associated Press that he has yet to see "any great desire on [Cruz's] part to really bring the party along with him, so that's something that worries me."
Representative Pete King of New York called Cruz a "fraud," saying that he couldn't name a single person in Washington "who gets this opposition from his own people.... I'm talking about people as conservative as he is who just can't stand him."
Richard Burr of North Carolina even reportedly told supporters at a campaign fundraiser that he would rather vote for socialist senator Bernie Sanders than Cruz. 
A few of the more glaring highlights that Cruz's detractors cite in their opposition:

Cruz implied that former senator Chuck Hagel had received compensation from North Korea during a confirmation hearing
His confrontation with the White House over the Affordable Care Act resulted in a 16-day government shutdown that Americans largely blamed on the Republican party
Last year, Cruz accused McConnell of lying about scheduling a vote on the Export-Import Bank in a speech on the senate floor
And who does the senate seem ready to crown as Miss Congeniality? Florida senator Marco Rubio, who has received the endorsement of four Republican members of the chamber.
Cruz has received none.

 Reporting from the frosty snowfields of  Arendelle  Iowa, the Guardian's Ben Jacobs points out that the campaign's favorite pediatric neurosurgeon is well-protected - if not well supported:
Everyone remembers that Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have Secret Service protection - but a third candidate does as well.
Despite his precipitous fall in polls, Ben Carson still has Secret Service protection. The retired neurosurgeon was given Secret Service protection in November along with Trump, at a point when the two were still neck-and-neck in the polls. Secret Service protection is awarded based a mix of factors, including polling and the number of death threats received. Hillary Clinton has been entitled to a Secret Service detail since the start of the campaign and beyond, due to her status as a former first lady.
The result is a jarring juxtaposition as one arrives at a Carson event. Despite his diminishing standing in the polls and a crowd that is heavily composed of high school students eager for an excuse to leave class early, there are still agents in suits and earpieces alertly scanning the crowd and a magnetometer at the entrance to the event.

Vermont senator Bernie Sanders is becoming a bit of a cut-up on the campaign trail, to rave reviews from audiences, reports Washington Bureau chief Dan Roberts: 
One sign of growing confidence in the Bernie Sanders camp is his willingness to gently mock his reputation for quirky public speaking. In recent days we've had quips about his hair and dress sense that do much to endear him to young supporters, but today at Southern New Hampshire University he took on the reputation for giving lectures. "Let me a bit professorial here," said Sanders to laughter from the students. "Who knows the difference between real unemployment and official unemployment?", he asked, in an exchange that would not have been out of place in economics class.
The next assignment concerns the environment - a big theme here where Sanders was joined by campaigner Bill McKibben. "How does that relate to campaign finance?" asked the prof, before explaining his theory of the link between energy industry lobbying and climate change denial among Republicans.
 It's not all one way though. After he acknowledged being accused of "Santa Claus" tendencies, one student asks the six-million-dollar question about how Sanders can possibly achieve everything he is proposing. "What am I smoking, you mean?," he shot back to more laughter.
   A young Sanders supporter is in on the joke.  
(His answer, in case you were wondering, is that all radical change takes people by surprise.)

 More from the Cable News Network's polling apparatus... 
The same survey that showed Hillary Clinton with a devastating eight-point deficit in Iowa indicates additional good news for outsider candidates who are relatively new to their party of choice. Billionaire frontrunner Donald Trump holds a double-digit lead among likely Republican caucus-goers in the Hawkeye State, leading Texas senator Ted Cruz by eleven points, 37% to 26%. The survey, conducted earlier this week, finds Florida senator Marco Rubio in third place at 14%, the only other Republican candidate to hold double digits in the state.
Trump jumped four points since the same poll was conducted in late November/early December, while Cruz picked up six points. Fifty-four percent of likely Iowa voters see Trump as the most qualified candidate to handle the economy, and an outright majority of 51% say he's the best candidate on immigration. He even edges out Cruz on foreign policy, 27% to 25%, although among social conservatives, the Texas senator walks away with a leading 29% who are concerned about same-sex marriage and abortion.
Among the lower tier, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson "leads" with 6% - a quarter of the support he had among likely caucus-goers in October - with Jeb Bush and Mike Huckabee tied for fifth place at 3% each. Kentucky senator Rand Paul, who has put little energy in Iowa, is at 2%, while Chris Christie, Carly Fiorina, John Kasich and previous caucus-winner Rick Santorum each pull in only 1% support.
 Put another way: If supporters of the bottom eight candidates were to coalesce behind a single person, that candidate would be in third place.

 Hillary Clinton's latest Iowa poll numbers are borderline disastrous  
 CNN polls are officially on the Clinton hit list. 
With only 11 days to go before the Iowa caucuses, a new CNN/ORC poll released Thursday afternoon finds Vermont senator Bernie Sanders with an astonishing eight-point lead over Hillary Clinton in Iowa - 51% to 43%. It's a dramatic reversal of fortunes for the former secretary of state, who led Sanders by 18 points in the same poll last December, 54% to 36%.
The poll arrives on the heels of a CNN/WMUR poll released earlier this week that shows Sanders with a commanding 27-point lead in New Hampshire. A one-two loss in both Iowa, originally deemed safe Clinton territory, and New Hampshire could indicate an existential threat to the former secretary of state's candidacy.
 Key to Sanders' lead: voters who will be caucusing for the first time. Among Democrats who caucused in 2008, Clinton leads Sanders by a comfortable 17 points, 55% to 38%. The self-declared socialist can also credit his perceived authenticity on economic issues as a major factor in the surge in support. Likely caucus-goers told CNN that they trust Sanders over Clinton on the economy by 22 points - two in three surveyed said they felt he would do more for America's middle class. A mere 30% felt that way about Clinton.
It wasn't exclusively bad news for the former secretary of state, who leads on foreign policy among likely Iowa voters, viewed as more trustworthy on the issue by a margin of 40 points. Additionally, despite what appear to be massive weaknesses in early states, Clinton is seen as the candidate most likely to win the general election in November, 60% to 38%.

It may have flown under the radar, but an unexpectedly popular presidential candidate has picked up a huge (yuge?) endorsement from a vanguard of his adopted party's activist wing.
No, not Donald Trump. Obviously, you heard all about that endorsement.
 Vermont senator Bernie Sanders picked up the endorsement of The Nation, the oldest continuously published weekly magazine in the US and self-described "flagship of the left," earlier this month. Now, Katrina vanden Heuvel, The Nation's editor and publisher, has come out in an interview explaining the progressive magazine's decision to endorse a primary candidate for only the third time in its 150-year history.
"It is a statement of commitment to issues we believe in above all," said vanden Heuvel in the magazine's podcast Start Making Sense. Sanders, vanden Heuvel said, "lifts up, amplifies the issues that have animated The Nation over these last decades."
"The key issue... is inequality," she elaborated. "There are many kinds of inequality, but Bernie Sanders is an unbought and passionate fighter against a rigged system and metastasizing inequality, economic and political."
 "Above all, it was his commitment to exposing a rigged system" that prompted The Nation to give the self-declared socialist its endorsement in the Democratic primary.
An endorsement from The Nation is a rare event - the periodical has previously endorsed Ulysses S. Grant in 1868, Norman Thomas in 1943 and Franklin Delano Roosevelt in each of his four campaigns - and even rarer in a primary campaign. It's the second time that the magazine has endorsed Hillary Clinton's main rival in the Democratic primary, having bestowed the honor upon then-senator Barack Obama in 2008.

Despite some new polls showing Bernie Sanders ahead in New Hampshire by as much as 27 points, there is an air of realism at his first campaign stop since the latest surge captured headlines here, writes Guardian Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts: 
The meeting with seniors at the Peterborough community center reflected a conscious push by the campaign to bolster support among older voters, whose undeniable interest in the 74-year-old has been somewhat eclipsed by the more vocal enthusiasm Sanders generally receives from students and younger voters.
 "He cares about us older folks  - he is one of us you know," says Merry Stockwell, a volunteer who introduced the senator from neighbouring Vermont to this retirement community an hour or so north of Boston.
"I believe in what he is saying, I'm just not sure how much of it he is going to be able to achieve," said Ruth, a 68-year-old retired educator from the nearby town of Antrim, who is one of the many voters in the state still to make up their minds.
Though equally sceptical about Hillary Clinton - "Hillary has got a lot of baggage" - she shrugs when asked what might convince her that Sanders can realistically take on Republicans and win the White House.

 Clinton sends army of surrogates to Iowa  
There's probably no one in the race who could (literally, not figuratively) win a shouting match against Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, whose trademark is a full-throated tirade against the billionaire class, writes the Guardian's Lauren Gambino: 
But locked in a tight race with just days to go before voting begins, Hillary Clinton is dispatching  actors, athletes, musicians, politicians, activists and family members across the Hawkeye state to help her turn up the volume on the campaign trail.
In lieu of the former secretary of state, Iowans can catch Juli·n Castro, former mayor of San Antonio and secretary of Housing and Urban Development; actress and activists Jamie Lee Curtis; athlete and activist Billie Jean King;  Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund; Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York; Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia; Stephanie Schriock, President of EMILY's List; Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey; and Scandal actor Tony Goldwyn.

Clinton has even more politicians, entertainers and athletes - plus husband Bill and daughter Chelsea  - fanning out across other key early-voting states, including New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada in the coming days and weeks.
A much smaller group of surrogates will hit the trail on Sanders' behalf. They include rapper and activist  Killer Mike ; professor Cornel West ; Ben Cohen, co-founder of Ben & Jerry's ice cream; and climate activist Bill McKibben, to name a few.

"Senator Sanders and I share many of the same goals," Clinton says, but they have different ways of going about them. 
 "Take health care,"  she says. "I want us to defend and build on the progress we have made under president Obama with the Affordable Care Act.... I want to keep going, keep expanding coverage to more people.
"We can get this done without another divisive debate about our entire health care system and without giving Republicans a window to tear down" what we've built. 
"Rather than build on the progress we've made," Clinton continues, "[Sanders] wants to start over from scratch with a whole new system.
"In theory, there's a lot to like about some of his ideas, but in t heory isn't enough.  A president has to deliver in reality."

The video follows the release on Tuesday of a letter sent by 10 former senior US diplomats and national security officials calling Sanders's foreign policy agenda "troubling" and "puzzling."
Sanders replied to the letter by pointing out that "on the crucial foreign policy issue of our time, it turns out that Secretary Clinton - with all of her experience - was wrong and I was right."

 Planned Parenthood: abortion will be 'defining issue'  
On the 43rd anniversary of Roe v Wade, Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richard s said there has never been a more important election for women's rights, writes the Guardian's Lauren Gambino: 
"There's never been an election in which Roe was more clearly on the ballot," Richards told reporters on Thursday. "I do think  it's going to be a defining issue  for voters all across the country."
    Cecile Richards and Hillary Clinton in Hooksett, NH, on 10 January.  Photograph: Steven Senne/AP   
At least one and as many as four supreme court appointments are likely to fall to the next president. A conservative majority could overturn Roe V Wade, the 1973 decision protecting a woman's right to choose.
"Young people in America cannot imagine, and are only now beginning to come to grips with the fact, that there are folks in this country who are either in elective office or are trying to get into elective office that would take away a right that has been the law of the land now for more than 40 years," Richards said. "It's been an enormous wake-up call."
Planned Parenthood has endorsed Hillary Clinton for president, the organization's first-ever primary endorsement in its century-long existence.
On Wednesday, Clinton's rival, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, deemed Planned Parenthood and the host of other liberal organizations and labor unions backing Clinton part of the "establishment".

Sanders said on MSNBC that his campaign is not only taking on Wall Street and the economic elite, but the "political establishment" as well.
"I have friends and supporters in the Human Rights Fund and Planned Parenthood," Sanders said, referring to two organizations that have endorsed Clinton. "But you know what? Hillary Clinton has been around there for a very, very long time. Some of these groups are, in fact, part of the establishment."
Clinton quickly hit back, defending Planned Parenthood: "I wish it were [establishment]. If it were part of the establishment, we wouldn't have to work so hard to protect it."

"His moderation is on full display during a week-long tour across bluer parts of the state - Kasich is stumping primarily in counties that Barack Obama won during the last presidential election. With 44% of the Granite State's voters registered as independents, Kasich has a huge (yuge?) opportunity with non-traditional GOP voters."

He went on: "Listen, you know when I will? When I think it makes sense to.  I'm not in this to just beat Donald Trump. I'm in this to become president of the United States and I'm going to make certain decisions about when I want to say what I'm going to say."

 Voters don't expect the nominating races to come out the way that current polling seems to indicate they may come out, writes Guardian US data editor Mona Chalabi. " Either Americans aren't watching polls or else they simply don't trust them," Mona writes:
A poll from Loras college this morning puts Donald Trump and Ted Cruz neck-and-neck, with just 1 percentage point separating them in Iowa. There's nothing particularly surprising about that finding - it's not far off the average across all Iowa polls, which has Trump at 28%, Cruz at 27% and Rubio trailing at 11%.
What's interesting though are the follow-up questions Loras included about expectations. When 1,000 likely 2016 caucus-goers were asked this month who they thought would win Iowa, 3 8% said Cruz while 29% said Trump.  
Those expectations were flipped for the national race, though, where 36% said they thought Trump would be the Republican nominee while only 21% thought Cruz would get the backing of the party.

On the Democrat side, a recent survey from YouGov points to a similar gap between expectations and polling data:  people think Sanders has much less of a chance in Iowa than polls suggest.  Overall, 51% expect Clinton to win Iowa and only 35% think Sanders can while polling averages suggest it will be a much closer race: 47% Clinton and 43% Sanders.

The alleged ambush occurred when Fiorina hosted a "right to life" forum at the Greater Des Moines botanical garden. Entering the rally, before a crowd of about 60 people, she directed around 15 young children towards a makeshift stage.

The problem, one parent said, was that the children's parents had not given Fiorina permission to have their children sit with her - in front of a huge banner bearing the image of an unborn foetus - while she talked about harvesting organs from aborted babies.
"The kids went there to see the plants," said Chris Beck, the father of four-year-old Chatham, one of the children Fiorina appeared with. "She ambushed my son's field trip."

Hello and welcome to our live-wire, minute-to-minute coverage of the 2016 presidential election. 
It's an interesting mix today, with Guardian reporters following Hillary Clinton and Ben Carson in Iowa, Donald Trump and Bill Clinton in Nevada and no fewer than four Republican candidates in New Hampshire - Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz. Democrat Bernie Sanders is also campaigning in the Granite State.
 In a new ad to air in Iowa, Sanders has gone full Simon & Garfunkel:
   America was released 48 years ago.  
Donald Trump dished last night on CNN on what it was like to stand next to Sarah Palin during the rambling 20-minute speech she gave to endorse him on Tuesday. 
 "I didn't know it was going to be quite that long,"  Trump said.
... but she made a beautiful, you know, she made a very good speech. No, I wasn't uncomfortable - I was very happy. I would have normally left the stage and let her speak ... I thought it would be disrespectful to her if I left the stage. So, no, I wasn't uncomfortable at all."
He doesn't look uncomfortable in this mashup:
Trump spent part of Wednesday hammering Texas senator Ted Cruz, seemingly his closest rival in Iowa, which votes in just 11 days' time. 
This morning it appears the Republican establishment has picked a horse in the Trump-Cruz race - and it is Trump.  Bob Dole, the former senator and presidential nominee, told the New York Times Republicans would suffer "cataclysmic" losses with Cruz and that Trump would be better.
 Trent Lott, the former Senate majority  leader, told the Atlantic he'd take Trump over Cruz if he had to choose. Trump himself pointed out that "Everybody dislikes [Cruz]. I mean, he's a nasty guy that everybody dislikes."
 Cruz hit back, saying there actually is a new alignment between Trump and the establishment - difficult to argue, except in the case of a Trump-Cruz race - and trying to use it against Trump.
"Right now the Washington establishment is  abandoning Marco Rubio, they made an assessment that Marco can't win this race, and the Washington establishment is rushing over to support Donald Trump," Cruz told Politico. 
We're seeing that happen every day and Mr Trump is welcoming the support of the Washington establishment.
In other news, Ben Carson resumes campaign activities today after the death on Tuesday of a volunteer, in a van crash.
At the state level, last night emails released to the public indicated that Michigan governor Rick Snyder was informed of water quality issues in the city of Flint as early as February 2015 but his administration struck a dismissive tone, saying the problems would eventually "fade in the rearview".

The Weekly Beast: drama at Australian Women's Weekly, Cleo and Dolly; 
Cleo is dumped and Helen McCabe's tenure editing AWW ends as News Corp beds down new year appointments and Daily Mail Australia splits with Nine.

Amanda Meade.

There has been enough drama at the magazine empire of the Australian Women's Weekly, Dolly and Cleo in the past month to fuel another couple of miniseries in the vein of Paper Giants. The once-proud Australian company owned by the late Kerry Packer is being slowly downsized by its German owners, Bauer Media, who bought the company for $500m in 2012. 
One by one, titles have been closed or merged until this week a big-name title steeped in Australian cultural history, Cleo, was unceremoniously dumped. As well as losing several senior executives and outsourcing the printing and distribution of its 60 titles, Bauer parted company with the editor-in-chief of the Australian Women's Weekly, which is still Australia's bestselling magazine. After six years at the Weekly, former News Corp senior journalist Helen McCabe was suddenly out the door, reportedly with the remaining six months of her contract to be served on "gardening leave" and no job lined up. Weekly Beast understands Bauer's top brass is keen to get back to the magazine's roots in middle-class suburban life and away from the focus on news, politics and executive women that marked McCabe's tenure.  
 Related:  Cleo magazine to close and Dolly to become bimonthly, Bauer Media says
"In a very pretentious way Helen tried to turn that magazine into Vanity Fair," one magazine insider told Beast. 
Sources say the publisher Matt Dominello has made no secret of the fact he wants the Weekly to get back to being a mass-market magazine focused on middle-aged mums, knitting, cooking and celebrities. McCabe has so far declined to comment on her future, but she has remained close to News Corp and may yet turn up at Holt Street.
The Bauer executive is now looking for someone significantly cheaper to run the Weekly (McCabe's salary was $400,000).Whoever the new editor-in-chief is, her digital strategy will have to be a priority - the website has improved under McCabe's tenure but still has a long way to go. Some of the names being mentioned as outside hires are Kate de Brito, a former News Corp journalist who is now editing Mamamia, the former editor of Mamamia, Jamila Rizvi, and Daily Telegraph columnist and editor Sarrah Le Marquand.

Why Bali was the 'shareable' word of 2015
You might be surprised to hear that the most shareable word in 2015 was "Bali". Why? The authors of All Your Friends Like This - How Social Networks Took Over News (HarperCollins, 2015) found that people share news "as an expression of values and judgement". Co-author Andrew Hunter, the editor-in-chief at Microsoft, said last year everyone had an opinion about the executions in Bali of Australian drug runners Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran - and to prove their passion they shared countless stories about it. The other 14 most shareable words, according Hunter and Hal Crawford, the editor-in-chief of Ninemsn, were: girl, Bishop, Tony, Paris, health, Turnbull, children, cancer, climate, dog, hospital, media, secret and shark, reflecting popular stories such as the Bronwyn Bishop choppergate scandal, the Paris attacks, climate change, Mick Fanning's shark attack and the demise of Tony Abbott's prime ministership.

News Corp's new year shake-up
News Corp Australia chiefs have made several appointments in the new year, promoting Herald Sun news editor Liam Houlihan to editor of the Geelong Advertiser and the editor of the Sunday Herald Sun, Jill Baker, to the new position of executive editor, Sundays. Baker will be succeeded as editor of the Sunday paper by Geelong Advertiser editor Nick Papps. The bigger name editors all moved into position at the Australian, the Daily Telegraph and the Courier Mail over Christmas. However, we are yet to hear of any major changes that Paul Whittaker, Chris Dore or Lachlan Heywood have made at their respective titles. Steady as she goes. We are also still waiting for Chris Mitchell's promised media column to appear in the the Australian's media section, as promised by Darren Davidson last year. "Mr Mitchell will return to his journalistic roots, writing a regular column for the Australian in the Monday media section," Davidson reported. 

Red/black faces at Fox Sports
Some guests at the Fox Sports Christmas party were a little taken aback to see one personality turn up in blackface at the Ibiza-themed celebration. Photographs seen by Beast reveal the outfit included black make-up covering his face, head and hands, dark sunglasses, headphones around his neck and a black sweatshirt and jeans. Apparently he was depicting a partying West Indian cricketer. Fox Sports management declined to comment on whether there had been any repercussions.

Daily Mail and Nine's conscious uncoupling
In another big media shakeup, Daily Mail Australia has broken off its partnership with Nine, two years after the popular global website launched here. To launch its racy news offering in Australia, the Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT) entered into a joint-venture with the Nine Entertainment Company, which provided traffic and sales support while the Mail operated independently in editorial. But increasingly, the two online sites became rivals, and ninemsn (No 4) overtook the Daily Mail (No 5) in the Nielsen online ratings last month. 
At a meeting last Monday in Sydney between the global Mail Online publisher and chief executive, Martin Clarke, and the chief executive of Nine, Hugh Marks, it was decided to part ways. Peter Holder, the managing director of Daily Mail Australia, told Weekly Beast the joint venture was "never going to be forever" and the Mail was now focused on increasing its readership and ad sales. "We couldn't have done it without the help of Nine," Holder said. "We've become more rivals than partners and both parties agreed it was time. We're working closely to unwind it and there is certainly no bad blood." If anything Mail readers may benefit from the break in the partnership as Beast understands Nine's publicity department was never pleased when the Mail covered rival network shows - such as The Bachelor Australia - or reported on Nine's personalities in an unflattering way.

If Congress handed out superlatives at the end of every session - and if the continued drollery of the Miss America pageant is any indication, it should - Texas senator Ted Cruz would be in no danger of winning "Most Popular."
A new report from the Associated Press highlights Cruz's deep unpopularity within the US senate, calling him the "least-favorite colleague" of nearly every Republican senator. But the abhorrence for Cruz's personal politics and perceived grandstanding is giving way in the upper chamber to panic as members of the senate worry that Cruz's nomination could spell the end of the party's control of Congress.
   He came in like a wrecking ball...   
Orrin Hatch of Utah told the Associated Press that he has yet to see "any great desire on [Cruz's] part to really bring the party along with him, so that's something that worries me."
Representative Pete King of New York called Cruz a "fraud," saying that he couldn't name a single person in Washington "who gets this opposition from his own people.... I'm talking about people as conservative as he is who just can't stand him."
Richard Burr of North Carolina even reportedly told supporters at a campaign fundraiser that he would rather vote for socialist senator Bernie Sanders than Cruz. 
A few of the more glaring highlights that Cruz's detractors cite in their opposition:

Cruz implied that former senator Chuck Hagel had received compensation from North Korea during a confirmation hearing
His confrontation with the White House over the Affordable Care Act resulted in a 16-day government shutdown that Americans largely blamed on the Republican party
Last year, Cruz accused McConnell of lying about scheduling a vote on the Export-Import Bank in a speech on the senate floor
And who does the senate seem ready to crown as Miss Congeniality? Florida senator Marco Rubio, who has received the endorsement of four Republican members of the chamber.
Cruz has received none.

"I do not, myself," said a woman in Brooklyn's pharmacy, when I asked if she liked Sanders.
"I'm not a big fan of spreading the wealth. I think you should get what you earn," said a man called Paul, when I asked him why he didn't like Sanders. Paul was sitting in Brooklyn's grocery store, Seaton's Flag Foods, with five friends. 
None of them supported Bernie Sanders.

 Reporting from the frosty snowfields of  Arendelle  Iowa, the Guardian's Ben Jacobs points out that the campaign's favorite pediatric neurosurgeon is well-protected - if not well supported:
Everyone remembers that Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have Secret Service protection - but a third candidate does as well.
Despite his precipitous fall in polls, Ben Carson still has Secret Service protection. The retired neurosurgeon was given Secret Service protection in November along with Trump, at a point when the two were still neck-and-neck in the polls. Secret Service protection is awarded based a mix of factors, including polling and the number of death threats received. Hillary Clinton has been entitled to a Secret Service detail since the start of the campaign and beyond, due to her status as a former first lady.
The result is a jarring juxtaposition as one arrives at a Carson event. Despite his diminishing standing in the polls and a crowd that is heavily composed of high school students eager for an excuse to leave class early, there are still agents in suits and earpieces alertly scanning the crowd and a magnetometer at the entrance to the event.

Vermont senator Bernie Sanders is becoming a bit of a cut-up on the campaign trail, to rave reviews from audiences, reports Washington Bureau chief Dan Roberts: 
One sign of growing confidence in the Bernie Sanders camp is his willingness to gently mock his reputation for quirky public speaking. In recent days we've had quips about his hair and dress sense that do much to endear him to young supporters, but today at Southern New Hampshire University he took on the reputation for giving lectures. "Let me a bit professorial here," said Sanders to laughter from the students. "Who knows the difference between real unemployment and official unemployment?", he asked, in an exchange that would not have been out of place in economics class.
The next assignment concerns the environment - a big theme here where Sanders was joined by campaigner Bill McKibben. "How does that relate to campaign finance?" asked the prof, before explaining his theory of the link between energy industry lobbying and climate change denial among Republicans.
 It's not all one way though. After he acknowledged being accused of "Santa Claus" tendencies, one student asks the six-million-dollar question about how Sanders can possibly achieve everything he is proposing. "What am I smoking, you mean?," he shot back to more laughter.
   A young Sanders supporter is in on the joke.  
(His answer, in case you were wondering, is that all radical change takes people by surprise.)

 More from the Cable News Network's polling apparatus... 
The same survey that showed Hillary Clinton with a devastating eight-point deficit in Iowa indicates additional good news for outsider candidates who are relatively new to their party of choice. Billionaire frontrunner Donald Trump holds a double-digit lead among likely Republican caucus-goers in the Hawkeye State, leading Texas senator Ted Cruz by eleven points, 37% to 26%. The survey, conducted earlier this week, finds Florida senator Marco Rubio in third place at 14%, the only other Republican candidate to hold double digits in the state.
Trump jumped four points since the same poll was conducted in late November/early December, while Cruz picked up six points. Fifty-four percent of likely Iowa voters see Trump as the most qualified candidate to handle the economy, and an outright majority of 51% say he's the best candidate on immigration. He even edges out Cruz on foreign policy, 27% to 25%, although among social conservatives, the Texas senator walks away with a leading 29% who are concerned about same-sex marriage and abortion.
Among the lower tier, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson "leads" with 6% - a quarter of the support he had among likely caucus-goers in October - with Jeb Bush and Mike Huckabee tied for fifth place at 3% each. Kentucky senator Rand Paul, who has put little energy in Iowa, is at 2%, while Chris Christie, Carly Fiorina, John Kasich and previous caucus-winner Rick Santorum each pull in only 1% support.
 Put another way: If supporters of the bottom eight candidates were to coalesce behind a single person, that candidate would be in third place.

 Hillary Clinton's latest Iowa poll numbers are borderline disastrous  
 CNN polls are officially on the Clinton hit list. 
With only 11 days to go before the Iowa caucuses, a new CNN/ORC poll released Thursday afternoon finds Vermont senator Bernie Sanders with an astonishing eight-point lead over Hillary Clinton in Iowa - 51% to 43%. It's a dramatic reversal of fortunes for the former secretary of state, who led Sanders by 18 points in the same poll last December, 54% to 36%.
The poll arrives on the heels of a CNN/WMUR poll released earlier this week that shows Sanders with a commanding 27-point lead in New Hampshire. A one-two loss in both Iowa, originally deemed safe Clinton territory, and New Hampshire could indicate an existential threat to the former secretary of state's candidacy.
 Key to Sanders' lead: voters who will be caucusing for the first time. Among Democrats who caucused in 2008, Clinton leads Sanders by a comfortable 17 points, 55% to 38%. The self-declared socialist can also credit his perceived authenticity on economic issues as a major factor in the surge in support. Likely caucus-goers told CNN that they trust Sanders over Clinton on the economy by 22 points - two in three surveyed said they felt he would do more for America's middle class. A mere 30% felt that way about Clinton.
It wasn't exclusively bad news for the former secretary of state, who leads on foreign policy among likely Iowa voters, viewed as more trustworthy on the issue by a margin of 40 points. Additionally, despite what appear to be massive weaknesses in early states, Clinton is seen as the candidate most likely to win the general election in November, 60% to 38%.

It may have flown under the radar, but an unexpectedly popular presidential candidate has picked up a huge (yuge?) endorsement from a vanguard of his adopted party's activist wing.
No, not Donald Trump. Obviously, you heard all about that endorsement.
 Vermont senator Bernie Sanders picked up the endorsement of The Nation, the oldest continuously published weekly magazine in the US and self-described "flagship of the left," earlier this month. Now, Katrina vanden Heuvel, The Nation's editor and publisher, has come out in an interview explaining the progressive magazine's decision to endorse a primary candidate for only the third time in its 150-year history.
"It is a statement of commitment to issues we believe in above all," said vanden Heuvel in the magazine's podcast Start Making Sense. Sanders, vanden Heuvel said, "lifts up, amplifies the issues that have animated The Nation over these last decades."
"The key issue... is inequality," she elaborated. "There are many kinds of inequality, but Bernie Sanders is an unbought and passionate fighter against a rigged system and metastasizing inequality, economic and political."
 "Above all, it was his commitment to exposing a rigged system" that prompted The Nation to give the self-declared socialist its endorsement in the Democratic primary.
An endorsement from The Nation is a rare event - the periodical has previously endorsed Ulysses S. Grant in 1868, Norman Thomas in 1943 and Franklin Delano Roosevelt in each of his four campaigns - and even rarer in a primary campaign. It's the second time that the magazine has endorsed Hillary Clinton's main rival in the Democratic primary, having bestowed the honor upon then-senator Barack Obama in 2008.
Listen to the full interview, in which vanden Heuvel (pronounced "VAN-din HOY-vul," in case you were stumped) praises Sanders' ability to raise millions almost exclusively from small donors, calling him "liberated" to pursue progressive policies without fear of political reprisal.

Despite some new polls showing Bernie Sanders ahead in New Hampshire by as much as 27 points, there is an air of realism at his first campaign stop since the latest surge captured headlines here, writes Guardian Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts: 
The meeting with seniors at the Peterborough community center reflected a conscious push by the campaign to bolster support among older voters, whose undeniable interest in the 74-year-old has been somewhat eclipsed by the more vocal enthusiasm Sanders generally receives from students and younger voters.
 "He cares about us older folks  - he is one of us you know," says Merry Stockwell, a volunteer who introduced the senator from neighbouring Vermont to this retirement community an hour or so north of Boston.
"I believe in what he is saying, I'm just not sure how much of it he is going to be able to achieve," said Ruth, a 68-year-old retired educator from the nearby town of Antrim, who is one of the many voters in the state still to make up their minds.
Though equally sceptical about Hillary Clinton - "Hillary has got a lot of baggage" - she shrugs when asked what might convince her that Sanders can realistically take on Republicans and win the White House.

There's probably no one in the race who could (literally, not figuratively) win a shouting match against Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, whose trademark is a full-throated tirade against the billionaire class, writes the Guardian's Lauren Gambino: 
But locked in a tight race with just days to go before voting begins, Hillary Clinton is dispatching  actors, athletes, musicians, politicians, activists and family members across the Hawkeye state to help her turn up the volume on the campaign trail.
In lieu of the former secretary of state, Iowans can catch Juli·n Castro, former mayor of San Antonio and secretary of Housing and Urban Development; actress and activists Jamie Lee Curtis; athlete and activist Billie Jean King;  Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund; Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York; Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia; Stephanie Schriock, President of EMILY's List; Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey; and Scandal actor Tony Goldwyn.

 "Take health care,"  she says. "I want us to defend and build on the progress we have made under president Obama with the Affordable Care Act.... I want to keep going, keep expanding coverage to more people.
"We can get this done without another divisive debate about our entire health care system and without giving Republicans a window to tear down" what we've built. 
"Rather than build on the progress we've made," Clinton continues, "[Sanders] wants to start over from scratch with a whole new system.
"In theory, there's a lot to like about some of his ideas, but in t heory isn't enough.  A president has to deliver in reality."

The video follows the release on Tuesday of a letter sent by 10 former senior US diplomats and national security officials calling Sanders's foreign policy agenda "troubling" and "puzzling."
Sanders replied to the letter by pointing out that "on the crucial foreign policy issue of our time, it turns out that Secretary Clinton - with all of her experience - was wrong and I was right."

 Planned Parenthood: abortion will be 'defining issue'  
On the 43rd anniversary of Roe v Wade, Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richard s said there has never been a more important election for women's rights, writes the Guardian's Lauren Gambino: 
"There's never been an election in which Roe was more clearly on the ballot," Richards told reporters on Thursday. "I do think  it's going to be a defining issue  for voters all across the country."

At least one and as many as four supreme court appointments are likely to fall to the next president. A conservative majority could overturn Roe V Wade, the 1973 decision protecting a woman's right to choose.
"Young people in America cannot imagine, and are only now beginning to come to grips with the fact, that there are folks in this country who are either in elective office or are trying to get into elective office that would take away a right that has been the law of the land now for more than 40 years," Richards said. "It's been an enormous wake-up call."
Planned Parenthood has endorsed Hillary Clinton for president, the organization's first-ever primary endorsement in its century-long existence.
On Wednesday, Clinton's rival, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, deemed Planned Parenthood and the host of other liberal organizations and labor unions backing Clinton part of the "establishment".

Sanders said on MSNBC that his campaign is not only taking on Wall Street and the economic elite, but the "political establishment" as well.

Hillary Clinton has been around there for a very, very long time. Some of these groups are, in fact, part of the establishment."
Clinton quickly hit back, defending Planned Parenthood: "I wish it were [establishment]. If it were part of the establishment, we wouldn't have to work so hard to protect it."

 Voters don't expect the nominating races to come out the way that current polling seems to indicate they may come out, writes Guardian US data editor Mona Chalabi. " Either Americans aren't watching polls or else they simply don't trust them," Mona writes:
A poll from Loras college this morning puts Donald Trump and Ted Cruz neck-and-neck, with just 1 percentage point separating them in Iowa. There's nothing particularly surprising about that finding - it's not far off the average across all Iowa polls, which has Trump at 28%, Cruz at 27% and Rubio trailing at 11%.
What's interesting though are the follow-up questions Loras included about expectations. When 1,000 likely 2016 caucus-goers were asked this month who they thought would win Iowa, 3 8% said Cruz while 29% said Trump.  
Those expectations were flipped for the national race, though, where 36% said they thought Trump would be the Republican nominee while only 21% thought Cruz would get the backing of the party.

On the Democrat side, a recent survey from YouGov points to a similar gap between expectations and polling data:  people think Sanders has much less of a chance in Iowa than polls suggest.  Overall, 51% expect Clinton to win Iowa and only 35% think Sanders can while polling averages suggest it will be a much closer race: 47% Clinton and 43% Sanders.

The problem, one parent said, was that the children's parents had not given Fiorina permission to have their children sit with her - in front of a huge banner bearing the image of an unborn foetus - while she talked about harvesting organs from aborted babies.
"The kids went there to see the plants," said Chris Beck, the father of four-year-old Chatham, one of the children Fiorina appeared with. "She ambushed my son's field trip."

Hello and welcome to our live-wire, minute-to-minute coverage of the 2016 presidential election. 
It's an interesting mix today, with Guardian reporters following Hillary Clinton and Ben Carson in Iowa, Donald Trump and Bill Clinton in Nevada and no fewer than four Republican candidates in New Hampshire - Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz. Democrat Bernie Sanders is also campaigning in the Granite State.
 In a new ad to air in Iowa, Sanders has gone full Simon & Garfunkel:
   America was released 48 years ago.  
Donald Trump dished last night on CNN on what it was like to stand next to Sarah Palin during the rambling 20-minute speech she gave to endorse him on Tuesday. 
 "I didn't know it was going to be quite that long,"  Trump said.
... but she made a beautiful, you know, she made a very good speech. No, I wasn't uncomfortable - I was very happy. I would have normally left the stage and let her speak ... I thought it would be disrespectful to her if I left the stage. So, no, I wasn't uncomfortable at all."
He doesn't look uncomfortable in this mashup:
Trump spent part of Wednesday hammering Texas senator Ted Cruz, seemingly his closest rival in Iowa, which votes in just 11 days' time. 
This morning it appears the Republican establishment has picked a horse in the Trump-Cruz race - and it is Trump.  Bob Dole, the former senator and presidential nominee, told the New York Times Republicans would suffer "cataclysmic" losses with Cruz and that Trump would be better.
 Trent Lott, the former Senate majority  leader, told the Atlantic he'd take Trump over Cruz if he had to choose. Trump himself pointed out that "Everybody dislikes [Cruz]. I mean, he's a nasty guy that everybody dislikes."
 Cruz hit back, saying there actually is a new alignment between Trump and the establishment - difficult to argue, except in the case of a Trump-Cruz race - and trying to use it against Trump.
"Right now the Washington establishment is  abandoning Marco Rubio, they made an assessment that Marco can't win this race, and the Washington establishment is rushing over to support Donald Trump," Cruz told Politico. 
We're seeing that happen every day and Mr Trump is welcoming the support of the Washington establishment.
In other news, Ben Carson resumes campaign activities today after the death on Tuesday of a volunteer, in a van crash.
At the state level, last night emails released to the public indicated that Michigan governor Rick Snyder was informed of water quality issues in the city of Flint as early as February 2015 but his administration struck a dismissive tone, saying the problems would eventually "fade in the rearview".

Former NoW editor Andy Coulson sets up PR firm; 
David Cameron's ex-communications director, who was jailed over phone hacking, launches firm offering corporate strategy and communications advice.

Kevin Rawlinson.

Andy Coulson, David Cameron's former communications director who was sentenced to 18 months in jail over phone hacking at the News of the World, has returned to the spotlight by setting up a PR firm, it has emerged.  
Coulson Chapell promises its clients "discreet corporate strategy and communications advice".
According to Companies House records, the firm was set up in January, with Coulson one of two owners. The former News of the World editor will be working alongside Pitch PR founder Henry Chappell.
A statement hinted that, nearly five years after he left Downing Street, Coulson is planning to return to the political arena.
"With Andy's extensive experience across media and politics, and a growing demand from CEOs, companies and organisations for strategic corporate and communications advice, we feel there is a real opportunity to establish a new agency in the marketplace," said Chappell on Thursday. 
Coulson said it had been a longstanding ambition to set up his own firm and he called Chappell the perfect business partner. He said: "From our combined experience, Coulson Chappell can offer a unique perspective to clients looking for clear, discreet and effective strategic advice."
Coulson was NoW editor between 2003 and 2007, having joined its sister title the Sun in 1988. He resigned from the Sunday paper when its royal editor, Clive Goodman, was convicted of phone hacking. Coulson then became the Conservative party's director of communications.
Following the 2010 general election, he was appointed to the same job in Downing Street by Cameron, the incoming prime minister. About a year later, he was arrested over phone-hacking allegations following his resignation from Downing Street in January 2011.
He was charged with conspiracy to illegally intercept communications and, in 2014, was sentenced to 18 months in prison, eventually serving just under five. His arrest and subsequent conviction led some to question the prime minister's judgment. 
Coulson's new firm was set up on 11 January this year, with the marketing consultant William Andrews as joint owner and director. It was originally given the name C and C Advisory Ltd but was changed soon after. 
It will share the Soho offices used by Pitch, the sports PR agency Chappell founded and where he serves as chief executive. In a statement, Coulson Chappell said the two businesses would run separately, but that "synergies between [them] will be sought". Chappell has worked in the sports industry for about 20 years.

Despite some new polls showing Bernie Sanders ahead in New Hampshire by as much as 27 points, there is an air of realism at his first campaign stop since the latest surge captured headlines here, writes Guardian Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts: 
The meeting with seniors at the Peterborough community center reflected a conscious push by the campaign to bolster support among older voters, whose undeniable interest in the 74-year-old has been somewhat eclipsed by the more vocal enthusiasm Sanders generally receives from students and younger voters.
 "He cares about us older folks  - he is one of us you know," says Merry Stockwell, a volunteer who introduced the senator from neighbouring Vermont to this retirement community an hour or so north of Boston. 
"I believe in what he is saying, I'm just not sure how much of it he is going to be able to achieve," said Ruth, a 68-year-old retired educator from the nearby town of Antrim, who is one of the many voters in the state still to make up their minds.
Though equally sceptical about Hillary Clinton - "Hillary has got a lot of baggage" - she shrugs when asked what might convince her that Sanders can realistically take on Republicans and win the White House.

 Clinton sends army of surrogates to Iowa  
There's probably no one in the race who could (literally, not figuratively) win a shouting match against Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, whose trademark is a full-throated tirade against the billionaire class, writes the Guardian's Lauren Gambino: 
But locked in a tight race with just days to go before voting begins, Hillary Clinton is dispatching  actors, athletes, musicians, politicians, activists and family members across the Hawkeye state to help her turn up the volume on the campaign trail.
In lieu of the former secretary of state, Iowans can catch Juli·n Castro, former mayor of San Antonio and secretary of Housing and Urban Development; actress and activists Jamie Lee Curtis; athlete and activist Billie Jean King;  Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund; Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York; Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia; Stephanie Schriock, President of EMILY's List; Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey; and Scandal actor Tony Goldwyn.

"We can get this done without another divisive debate about our entire health care system and without giving Republicans a window to tear down" what we've built. 
"Rather than build on the progress we've made," Clinton continues, "[Sanders] wants to start over from scratch with a whole new system.
"In theory, there's a lot to like about some of his ideas, but in t heory isn't enough.  A president has to deliver in reality."

The video follows the release on Tuesday of a letter sent by 10 former senior US diplomats and national security officials calling Sanders's foreign policy agenda "troubling" and "puzzling."

 Planned Parenthood: abortion will be 'defining issue'  
On the 43rd anniversary of Roe v Wade, Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richard s said there has never been a more important election for women's rights, writes the Guardian's Lauren Gambino: 
"There's never been an election in which Roe was more clearly on the ballot," Richards told reporters on Thursday. "I do think  it's going to be a defining issue  for voters all across the country."
    Cecile Richards and Hillary Clinton in Hooksett, NH, on 10 January.  Photograph: Steven Senne/AP   
At least one and as many as four supreme court appointments are likely to fall to the next president. A conservative majority could overturn Roe V Wade, the 1973 decision protecting a woman's right to choose.
"Young people in America cannot imagine, and are only now beginning to come to grips with the fact, that there are folks in this country who are either in elective office or are trying to get into elective office that would take away a right that has been the law of the land now for more than 40 years," Richards said. "It's been an enormous wake-up call."
Planned Parenthood has endorsed Hillary Clinton for president, the organization's first-ever primary endorsement in its century-long existence.
On Wednesday, Clinton's rival, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, deemed Planned Parenthood and the host of other liberal organizations and labor unions backing Clinton part of the "establishment".

Sanders said on MSNBC that his campaign is not only taking on Wall Street and the economic elite, but the "political establishment" as well.
"I have friends and supporters in the Human Rights Fund and Planned Parenthood," Sanders said, referring to two organizations that have endorsed Clinton. "But you know what? Hillary Clinton has been around there for a very, very long time. Some of these groups are, in fact, part of the establishment."
Clinton quickly hit back, defending Planned Parenthood: "I wish it were [establishment]. If it were part of the establishment, we wouldn't have to work so hard to protect it."

 Voters don't expect the nominating races to come out the way that current polling seems to indicate they may come out, writes Guardian US data editor Mona Chalabi. " Either Americans aren't watching polls or else they simply don't trust them," Mona writes:
A poll from Loras college this morning puts Donald Trump and Ted Cruz neck-and-neck, with just 1 percentage point separating them in Iowa. There's nothing particularly surprising about that finding - it's not far off the average across all Iowa polls, which has Trump at 28%, Cruz at 27% and Rubio trailing at 11%.
What's interesting though are the follow-up questions Loras included about expectations. When 1,000 likely 2016 caucus-goers were asked this month who they thought would win Iowa, 3 8% said Cruz while 29% said Trump.  
Those expectations were flipped for the national race, though, where 36% said they thought Trump would be the Republican nominee while only 21% thought Cruz would get the backing of the party.

On the Democrat side, a recent survey from YouGov points to a similar gap between expectations and polling data:  people think Sanders has much less of a chance in Iowa than polls suggest.  Overall, 51% expect Clinton to win Iowa and only 35% think Sanders can while polling averages suggest it will be a much closer race: 47% Clinton and 43% Sanders.

The alleged ambush occurred when Fiorina hosted a "right to life" forum at the Greater Des Moines botanical garden. Entering the rally, before a crowd of about 60 people, she directed around 15 young children towards a makeshift stage.

The problem, one parent said, was that the children's parents had not given Fiorina permission to have their children sit with her - in front of a huge banner bearing the image of an unborn foetus - while she talked about harvesting organs from aborted babies.
"The kids went there to see the plants," said Chris Beck, the father of four-year-old Chatham, one of the children Fiorina appeared with. "She ambushed my son's field trip."

Hello and welcome to our live-wire, minute-to-minute coverage of the 2016 presidential election. 
It's an interesting mix today, with Guardian reporters following Hillary Clinton and Ben Carson in Iowa, Donald Trump and Bill Clinton in Nevada and no fewer than four Republican candidates in New Hampshire - Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz. Democrat Bernie Sanders is also campaigning in the Granite State.
 In a new ad to air in Iowa, Sanders has gone full Simon & Garfunkel:
   America was released 48 years ago.  
Donald Trump dished last night on CNN on what it was like to stand next to Sarah Palin during the rambling 20-minute speech she gave to endorse him on Tuesday. 
 "I didn't know it was going to be quite that long,"  Trump said.
... but she made a beautiful, you know, she made a very good speech. No, I wasn't uncomfortable - I was very happy. I would have normally left the stage and let her speak ... I thought it would be disrespectful to her if I left the stage. So, no, I wasn't uncomfortable at all."
He doesn't look uncomfortable in this mashup:
Trump spent part of Wednesday hammering Texas senator Ted Cruz, seemingly his closest rival in Iowa, which votes in just 11 days' time. 
This morning it appears the Republican establishment has picked a horse in the Trump-Cruz race - and it is Trump.  Bob Dole, the former senator and presidential nominee, told the New York Times Republicans would suffer "cataclysmic" losses with Cruz and that Trump would be better.
 Trent Lott, the former Senate majority  leader, told the Atlantic he'd take Trump over Cruz if he had to choose. Trump himself pointed out that "Everybody dislikes [Cruz]. I mean, he's a nasty guy that everybody dislikes."
 Cruz hit back, saying there actually is a new alignment between Trump and the establishment - difficult to argue, except in the case of a Trump-Cruz race - and trying to use it against Trump.
"Right now the Washington establishment is  abandoning Marco Rubio, they made an assessment that Marco can't win this race, and the Washington establishment is rushing over to support Donald Trump," Cruz told Politico. 
We're seeing that happen every day and Mr Trump is welcoming the support of the Washington establishment.
In other news, Ben Carson resumes campaign activities today after the death on Tuesday of a volunteer, in a van crash.
At the state level, last night emails released to the public indicated that Michigan governor Rick Snyder was informed of water quality issues in the city of Flint as early as February 2015 but his administration struck a dismissive tone, saying the problems would eventually "fade in the rearview".

VW rejects call to compensate European drivers over emissions scandal; 
European commissioner for industry had urged German carmaker to pay out to 8.5m European drivers.

Jennifer Rankin in Brussels.

VW has dismissed a call from the EU's industry chief to pay compensation to European drivers who bought cars with emissions test-cheating software.
Elzbieta Bienkowska, the European commissioner for industry, urged the German carmaker to pay compensation to 8.5 million European drivers who had bought cars fitted with defeat devices when she met VW's chief executive, Matthias M¸ller, in Brussels on Thursday.
Bienkowska, a former deputy prime minister of Poland who oversees EU industry policy, is seeking to raise pressure on the German carmaker to pay compensation, although she has no formal powers to force payouts.  
In the US, where the scandal was uncovered, the group has agreed to pay $1,000 (£704) to 500,000 drivers. US owners of VW diesel cars with 2.0 engines will get $500 on a prepaid visa card and $500 in dealership credits, described by the company as a goodwill gesture, because it cannot yet remove the illegal software. 
In Europe, VW has promised to remove the device, but has no plans to pay compensation. The company argues it has done nothing illegal under EU law. 
 Related:  Volkswagen CEO meets head of US agency that exposed emissions scandal
In talks that were described as brief and open, the commissioner "invited the group once again to reflect on adequate ways to compensate consumers", a spokeswoman said. "She repeated her clear view that EU consumers should be treated in the same way as US customers." 
But officials admit they cannot force VW to pay out. "The scope for action by the commission is pretty much nil, so we can only send political messages," one said. 
A spokesman for VW in the UK said: "We don't see the case for compensation for two main reasons. One is that the vehicles are going to be fixed. There is no hindrance and people can continue to use their vehicles normally." 
The second reason, he said, is that the history of car recalls shows no reduction in resale value - disputing the argument that customers would lose out if they want to sell their cars. 
He added that VW cars sold in the US were "technically different" and had to pass stricter tests, while the company had not yet found a fix for the cars. "For all those reasons we decided to compensate US customers."
VW's headquarters in Wolfsburg did not immediately respond to request for comment, but a group spokesman told the New York Times earlier this week that the company had not broken the law in Europe, because the devices installed in millions of cars were not "forbidden" under EU law.
The scandal erupted last autumn when VW admitted that 11m of its cars were designed to cheat emissions tests. The company has set aside (EURO)6.5bn to deal with the crisis, although it could face fines of up to $18bn in the US as a result of a criminal investigation. 
The fallout has not only weighed on VW sales but called into question European regulators' ability to police car pollution standards. 
Bas Eickhout, a Dutch Green party member of the European parliament, said national authorities and the European commission had allowed the "regulatory breakdown to occur". 
 Related:  Volkswagen emissions scandal - timeline
Speaking on Thursday, after the parliament announced it would begin an investigation into the VW scandal next month, he said: "The commission has serious questions to answer over revelations it failed to act on evidence that car manufacturers were using manipulation  to avoid complying with EU car pollution rules. It must also explain why it sat on its hands in the face of evidence that many vehicles on the market exceeded EU pollution norms."
In the UK vehicle standards are enforced by an executive arm of the department of transport, the VCA.
The fact the scandal was uncovered in the US has caused soul searching in Europe, as officials scramble to overhaul vehicle-emissions tests. 
The European commission will push for the power to recall vehicles in breach of EU emissions standards, as well as the ability to fine carmakers that break pollution rules, when it announces a sweeping overhaul of car-sale regulations next week. 
However, the proposals could be weakened during the EU's lengthy legislative process and may run into opposition from countries with powerful car industries, such as Germany, France and the UK. 
The tension between the drive for tougher standards and leeway for the car industry is already visible as the EU struggles to bring emissions tests out of laboratory and into the real world. Last year, the British and German governments led efforts to water down reformed testing procedures for NOx emissions, a pollutant that causes the premature death of around 23,500 Britons each year. EU member states agreed to give carmakers more leeway to exceed pollution limits, as well as more time to adapt to stricter tests.
These rules could yet be rejected by the European parliament in a make-or break vote next month, forcing lawmakers back to the drawing board.

Fear of whistleblowing at BBC allowed Jimmy Savile to abuse, says leaked report; 
Lawyer for Jimmy Savile's victims says she finds it hard to believe management had no idea he was a danger.

Jamie Grierson, Josh Halliday and Jasper Jackson.

A widespread fear of whistleblowing among BBC staff allowed disgraced presenter Jimmy Savile to abuse girls and boys "in virtually every corner" of the broadcaster's premises without senior management being aware, a leaked draft report says.
Dame Janet Smith, who led the review into Savile's sexual misconduct at the BBC, said in the early version of her report that a reluctance to complain to senior management among BBC staff that existed in the 1970s and 1980s still remains today. 
As a result there is no evidence that any report of abuse "reached the ears or the desk" of senior staff - despite more than 100 individuals, including BBC workers, coming forward with tales of Savile's abuse.
But Liz Dux, a lawyer at Slater and Gordon who represents 168 of Savile's victims, found this conclusion was "not credible", telling the Guardian: "It beggars belief that given what was going onand with so many witnesses giving evidence to her of their suspicions and knowledge, 107 in total, that for her to conclude a lack of knowledge on the part of management and an acceptance of their inability to stop him I don't find is credible. I can't accept that on behalf of my clients." 
In the 53-page report, Smith also appears to excuse one producer for failing to flag concerns about Savile to avoid "painful consequences" of tackling such issues because he was a "creature of his time". 
Smith says producer missed several warnings that Savile was a threat, such as an incident when he heard Savile shout "Legal! Legal!" when hearing that a young girl was aged 16 and observed inappropriate conduct with staff, such as hand and arm licking.
However, Smith steps back from admonishing the producer because "tackling such issues would have been very painful" as senior management put great stock in the show's rating.
Among the rumours heard by the review were claims Savile was a paedophile, a necrophiliac, abused disabled people and took girls to his caravan to abuse them. However, none of the witnesses reported it to BBC management.
Some 45 victims gave evidence of "inappropriate physical sexual conduct" by Savile, including a woman who was nine at the time. Most of the women were over 16 when they were sexually assaulted by the DJ, the draft report says, but all the boys except one were under that age.
Incidents took place "in virtually every corner of the BBC premises" where Savile worked, according to the draft report, but all except one of the rapes and attempted rapes took place at the DJ's own flat or caravan. 
The very first victim who gave evidence to the review, known only as C1, described how she was aged 15 and doing work experience in the BBC's Broadcasting House canteen when she met Savile in 1986. 
The DJ asked her if she would have a cup of tea with him when she finished her work. When she agreed, he took her to his flat at 22 Park Crescent and raped her, the review says. 
When his star was rising in the early to mid-70s, Savile had a group of teenage fans - whom he called his "team" or "London team" - whom he would meet outside BBC studios and take back to his flat for sex. 
The report describes how one of the girls, called Angie, first met Savile in 1968 when she was 15 and he was 42. He raped her, telling her afterwards that she was not a virgin any more, it says. 
Six years later, Savile gave Angie a signed copy of his autobiography As It Happens with the inscription: "[Angie's name] of the Team. No Escape. Belongs to Jimmy Savile her keeper".
The report includes examples where BBC employees allegedly advised Savile's victims not to report their assaults. On one occasion, in 1970, a 19-year-old BBC Leeds worker was raped by Savile in his camper van outside King's Cross train station in London after going for a drink with two colleagues. 
The woman, named C5, told her colleagues what had happened and they were "sympathetic but advised her not to make any formal report", the draft report says. Both colleagues are now dead and were not interviewed by the Smith review team.
Smith said there were a number of "wake up calls" that sexual misconduct was taking place at the Top of the Pops studios but this was ignored by the BBC. 
The first, in 1969, was related to Top of the Pops photographer Harry Goodwin, now deceased, who allegedly took pornographic photos of teenage girls in his dressing room.
The next wake-up call in 1971 related to the death of Claire McAlpine, a teenager who committed suicide shortly after claiming she was assaulted by an unnamed BBC DJ.
An assistant floor manager on Top of the Pops from about 1969 to 1971 told the review that the show was "an extraordinary mixture of sleaze and innocence". Another said Savile's dressing room always seemed full of "kids".
But Smith says she does not believe senior management was made aware of Savile's abuse. "In the testosterone-laden atmosphere, where everyone was, in theory at least, over the age of 16, child protection was simply not a live issue," she says. "No one noticed what Savile was doing; he was able to hide in plain sight."
Smith also said: "There is still a widespread reluctance to complain about anything" at the BBC for fear of their positions. "It was explained to me that, in one respect, the position is even worse today than it was years ago in that so many people are now employed on short-term contracts or on a freelance basis, with little or no job security," she said.
Following on from this, it was Smith's view that it is possible that "predatory child abuser could be lurking undiscovered in the BBC even today". Following the leak, Smith released a statement describing the version of the report as "out of date" and said significant changes had been made to the final report, due to be released in six weeks' time. 
 Tony Hall, director general of the BBC, said the child abuse scandal was a "dark chapter in the history of the BBC" and vowed to make sure nothing like it happens again. 
In her final afterword, Smith insists no senior staff could have been made aware of Savile's misconduct. 
"There is no evidence that any report of physical sexual misconduct or inappropriate behaviour ever reached the ears or the desk of a senior producer or an executive producer let alone a head of department or other senior executive."

Putin's disturbing message for the west: your rules don't apply; 
Litvinenko findings further highlight Russian president's paranoid nationalism and international indifference.

Simon Tisdall.

The official conclusion that Vladimir Putin "probably approved" the murder of the former spy Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006 has again raised uncomfortable questions about Russian exceptionalism - and how best to handle relations with what many conservative western politicians regard as a rogue regime in Moscow. 
Russia's sense of detachment from the European mainstream, or to put it another way, its self-created isolationism and separateness, is nothing new. It dates back to the 1917 revolution and the communist era, or even further, to the days of Tolstoy, Turgenev and the tsars.  
But there are particular doubts about Putin, his strange brand of paranoid nationalism, and the state that has formed around the president. 
A key issue for Putin's western interlocutors is that Litvinenko's death is not an isolated case, though the manner of his death was exceptional. Prominent opponents and critics of Putin have frequently come to grief, at home and abroad. 
Anna Politkovskaya, an award-winning journalist, made her name reporting on Russian military abuses in the second Chechen war. She and her newspaper, Novaya Gazeta, fiercely opposed Putin's actions. 
In October 2006 - one month before Litvinenko died - Politkovskaya was shot dead outside her home. Although five men were convicted of her murder, it remains unclear who ordered the killing. 
Another cause cÈlËbre was that of Sergei Magnitsky, who investigated corruption at the heart of the Russian state. An accountant and auditor, Magnitsky claimed to have uncovered large-scale theft of state funds by highly placed officials. He was arrested, beaten and denied adequate medical treatment. His death in custody in 2009 provoked protests from western governments and human rights groups.
 Related:  Marina Litvinenko: 'You can silence one person but not the whole world'
And then there was the even more opaque case of Boris Nemtsov, a leading political opponent of Putin's, who was gunned down last February hours after issuing an appeal for public support in opposing Russia's war in Ukraine. Although several suspects have been arrested or have died in violent circumstances, no clear motive for the attack has been established. 
Putin's apparent lack of respect for what most nations, and the UN, regard as legal and democratic norms, and his apparent tolerance of high-level corruption at home and in relation to Russian state complicity in the Fifa World Cup and athletics drug abuse scandals, have further set the country apart. 
This exceptionalism has caused mounting problems on the international stage. Putin's support for pro-Russian secessionists in sovereign Georgian territory led to war there in 2008, when he ordered a large-scale invasion of the country following Georgian government provocations. The breakaway territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia remain under de facto Russian control. 
This action was a harbinger of worse to come. In March 2014 Russia annexed Crimea and intervened militarily in eastern Ukraine. Putin's actions, in open breach of international law and UN treaties, led to a protracted conflict in Ukraine, the imposition of western sanctions against Russia, and Russia's expulsion from the G8 group of countries. Russian-backed and armed fighters are also suspected of shooting down Malaysian Airlines flight Mhl. 
In similarly arbitrary fashion, Putin ordered Russian military forces into Syria last autumn in an attempt to reinforce Moscow's ally, Syria's beleaguered president, Bashar al-Assad. Human rights groups have recorded a rising civilian death toll as Putin's bombers pursue an apparently indiscriminate campaign against Assad opponents. Latest estimates suggest 1,015 civilians have died at Russian hands since September, including 238 children. 
Even areas where there might be common ground with the west have merely reinforced Russia's special view of itself. 
Although the US and Britain sympathise over jihadi extremism emanating from the north Caucasus region, the way Putin has dealt with it has often left a feeling of deep unease. 
Most notorious is the Beslan school hostage siege, mounted by Islamist terrorists in North Ossetia in September 2004, that ended in a terrifying massacre after security forces were ordered by the government to storm the building. In all, 334 hostages died, including 186 children. Far from apologising for the slaughter, Putin used the incident as a pretext to consolidate presidential security powers. 
This incident echoed the 2002 Moscow theatre siege - another terrorist attack that ended when the FSB pumped toxic gas into the theatre. All the attackers died but so, too, did 130 hostages. In any western country, such a calamity would have caused a political firestorm and top-level resignations. Not in Putin's Russia. 
Perhaps the key to understanding the president's seemingly recalcitrant, obstreperous and sometimes downright illegal behaviour is his determination to re-establish Russia's greatness - and his deep sense of Russian difference. Putin's disturbing message to his western critics, repeated in many varied ways over 16 years in power, is plain: in the Rodina, the motherland, your rules don't apply.

Jimmy Savile report leak reveals scathing criticism of BBC; 
Leaked draft of Dame Janet Smith's inquiry report claims that predatory child abuser could be lurking undiscovered in the BBC even now.

Nicola Slawson.

A leaked draft report into the BBC's practices at the time of the Jimmy Savile scandal has revealed the full extent of the former DJ's predatory sexual activity. 
The report, extracts of which were published by the investigative news website Exaro, is said to include "devastating detail" of the corporation's "sheer scale of awareness" of the late star's activities.
Dame Janet Smith's draft report is said to point to a "deferential culture", "untouchable stars" and "above the law" managers at the corporation. However, the BBC cannot be criticised for failing to uncover Savile's "sexual deviancy", it says. 
The retired judge's report outlines multiple rapes and indecent assaults on children by Savile, which she claims were all "in some way associated with the BBC". 
A BBC spokesman said they would not be commenting as they had not yet seen the final report or the draft. He said: "We cannot confirm the authenticity or contents of the leaked report and we don't believe Exaro has the full version."
Smith responded to the leak on Thursday morning, saying in a statement that the "document is out of date and significant changes have been made to its contents and conclusions. The document should not have been made public and cannot be relied upon in any circumstances. 
"The review will work with the BBC to arrange publication of its final report as quickly as possible to ensure that accurate and responsible reporting can take place."
In the afterword of the leaked report, which runs to more than 500 pages, the retired judge states: "Finally, I wish to consider whether it is possible that a predatory child abuser could be lurking undiscovered in the BBC even today. The answer is that I think it is possible."
Mark Watts, the editor-in-chief of Exaro, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday morning: "It is the draft from which criticisms were passed to individuals as relevant, and indeed to the BBC as an institution. It is quite important to realise that the BBC as an institution knew about these criticisms, and they are extensive, more than a year ago. It [the draft] is more than a year ago."
According to Exaro - which published 37,500 words of extracts from the draft report - one section says: "[Savile] would indulge in sexual touching while working on the set [of Top of the Pops or Jim'll Fix It] and on at least one occasion, he was actually on camera. Savile would seize the opportunity for sexual contact even in public places such as corridors, staircases and canteens."
Savile indecently assaulted an underage girl on the set of Top of the Pops in 1969, the report says. The girl told a member of floor staff, who ejected her from the building.
Savile also assaulted a 17-year-old girl on camera on Top of the Pops in 1976. She too complained to floor staff but "her complaint was brushed aside with the explanation that that was 'just Jimmy fooling about'," writes Smith in the leaked report.
Savile would arrange for particular girls to be on the podium next to him during the making of Top of the Pops and a producer said in the late 1970s: "Savile always used to choose the girls and boys he wanted close to him ... instead of letting the director or floor manager choose them." 
One witness in the report states: "Apart from the regular members of Savile's team, I know of at least two young girls [both underage] who were invited back to Savile's dressing room, where he abused them sexually."
Smith says most of Savile's rapes and sex abuse crimes took place in his flat or caravans, but admitted that she had heard of incidents occurring in "virtually every one of the BBC premises at which he worked".
In the chapter on the BBC's management culture, Exaro reports that Smith tells how a production assistant complained of a sexual assault by a colleague at the World Service between 1981 and 1984. The assistant was told by the personnel department that making a complaint would be "not making the right decision".
The report reads: "Several people who suffered at Savile's hands were not prepared to make any complaint.
"Perhaps the most stark example is [unnamed witness]. She was 19 and almost raped by Savile in his caravan, but, after having discussed the matter with colleagues, decided not to make any complaint either to the police or to the BBC.
"It was difficult in the BBC to make a complaint about another member of staff, it is not hard to imagine how much more difficult it must have been to make a complaint about a member of the 'talent' such as Savile."
Smith's investigation has interviewed 375 witnesses in connection with Savile, who died in 2011.
Earlier on Wednesday, it was announced that the final report would be published within six weeks, after police said they were no longer concerned about the report prejudicing ongoing investigations.
∑ This article was amended on 21 January 2015 to clarify details of the leak of the draft report. An earlier version suggested the report "contains more than 37,500 words over 500 pages".

 Clinton sends army of surrogates to Iowa  
There's probably no one in the race who could (literally, not figuratively) win a shouting match against Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, whose trademark is a full-throated tirade against the billionaire class, writes the Guardian's Lauren Gambino: 
But locked in a tight race with just days to go before voting begins, Hillary Clinton is dispatching  actors, athletes, musicians, politicians, activists and family members across the Hawkeye state to help her turn up the volume on the campaign trail.
In lieu of the former secretary of state, Iowans can catch Juli·n Castro, former mayor of San Antonio and secretary of Housing and Urban Development; actress and activists Jamie Lee Curtis; athlete and activist Billie Jean King;  Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund; Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York; Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia; Stephanie Schriock, President of EMILY's List; Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey; and Scandal actor Tony Goldwyn.

Clinton has even more politicians, entertainers and athletes - plus husband Bill and daughter Chelsea  - fanning out across other key early-voting states, including New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada in the coming days and weeks.
A much smaller group of surrogates will hit the trail on Sanders' behalf. They include rapper and activist  Killer Mike ; professor Cornel West ; Ben Cohen, co-founder of Ben & Jerry's ice cream; and climate activist Bill McKibben, to name a few.

 "Take health care,"  she says. "I want us to defend and build on the progress we have made under president Obama with the Affordable Care Act.... I want to keep going, keep expanding coverage to more people.
"We can get this done without another divisive debate about our entire health care system and without giving Republicans a window to tear down" what we've built. 
"Rather than build on the progress we've made," Clinton continues, "[Sanders] wants to start over from scratch with a whole new system.
"In theory, there's a lot to like about some of his ideas, but in t heory isn't enough.  A president has to deliver in reality."

The video follows the release on Tuesday of a letter sent by 10 former senior US diplomats and national security officials calling Sanders's foreign policy agenda "troubling" and "puzzling."
Sanders replied to the letter by pointing out that "on the crucial foreign policy issue of our time, it turns out that Secretary Clinton - with all of her experience - was wrong and I was right."

 Planned Parenthood: abortion will be 'defining issue'  
On the 43rd anniversary of Roe v Wade, Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richard s said there has never been a more important election for women's rights, writes the Guardian's Lauren Gambino: 
"There's never been an election in which Roe was more clearly on the ballot," Richards told reporters on Thursday. "I do think  it's going to be a defining issue  for voters all across the country."
    Cecile Richards and Hillary Clinton in Hooksett, NH, on 10 January.  Photograph: Steven Senne/AP   
At least one and as many as four supreme court appointments are likely to fall to the next president. A conservative majority could overturn Roe V Wade, the 1973 decision protecting a woman's right to choose.
"Young people in America cannot imagine, and are only now beginning to come to grips with the fact, that there are folks in this country who are either in elective office or are trying to get into elective office that would take away a right that has been the law of the land now for more than 40 years," Richards said. "It's been an enormous wake-up call."
Planned Parenthood has endorsed Hillary Clinton for president, the organization's first-ever primary endorsement in its century-long existence.
On Wednesday, Clinton's rival, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, deemed Planned Parenthood and the host of other liberal organizations and labor unions backing Clinton part of the "establishment".

Sanders said on MSNBC that his campaign is not only taking on Wall Street and the economic elite, but the "political establishment" as well.
"I have friends and supporters in the Human Rights Fund and Planned Parenthood," Sanders said, referring to two organizations that have endorsed Clinton. "But you know what? Hillary Clinton has been around there for a very, very long time. Some of these groups are, in fact, part of the establishment."
Clinton quickly hit back, defending Planned Parenthood: "I wish it were [establishment]. If it were part of the establishment, we wouldn't have to work so hard to protect it."

With 44% of the Granite State's voters registered as independents, Kasich has a huge (yuge?) opportunity with non-traditional GOP voters."

 Voters don't expect the nominating races to come out the way that current polling seems to indicate they may come out, writes Guardian US data editor Mona Chalabi. " Either Americans aren't watching polls or else they simply don't trust them," Mona writes:
A poll from Loras college this morning puts Donald Trump and Ted Cruz neck-and-neck, with just 1 percentage point separating them in Iowa. There's nothing particularly surprising about that finding - it's not far off the average across all Iowa polls, which has Trump at 28%, Cruz at 27% and Rubio trailing at 11%.
What's interesting though are the follow-up questions Loras included about expectations. When 1,000 likely 2016 caucus-goers were asked this month who they thought would win Iowa, 3 8% said Cruz while 29% said Trump.  
Those expectations were flipped for the national race, though, where 36% said they thought Trump would be the Republican nominee while only 21% thought Cruz would get the backing of the party.

On the Democrat side, a recent survey from YouGov points to a similar gap between expectations and polling data:  people think Sanders has much less of a chance in Iowa than polls suggest.  Overall, 51% expect Clinton to win Iowa and only 35% think Sanders can while polling averages suggest it will be a much closer race: 47% Clinton and 43% Sanders.

 Republican candidate Carly Fiorina has been accused of "ambushing" a group of children, after she ushered pre-schoolers, who were on a field trip to a botanical garden, into an anti-abortion rally in Des Moines, the Guardian's Adam Gabbatt reports: 
The alleged ambush occurred when Fiorina hosted a "right to life" forum at the Greater Des Moines botanical garden. Entering the rally, before a crowd of about 60 people, she directed around 15 young children towards a makeshift stage.

The problem, one parent said, was that the children's parents had not given Fiorina permission to have their children sit with her - in front of a huge banner bearing the image of an unborn foetus - while she talked about harvesting organs from aborted babies.
"The kids went there to see the plants," said Chris Beck, the father of four-year-old Chatham, one of the children Fiorina appeared with. "She ambushed my son's field trip."

Hello and welcome to our live-wire, minute-to-minute coverage of the 2016 presidential election. 
It's an interesting mix today, with Guardian reporters following Hillary Clinton and Ben Carson in Iowa, Donald Trump and Bill Clinton in Nevada and no fewer than four Republican candidates in New Hampshire - Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz. Democrat Bernie Sanders is also campaigning in the Granite State.
 In a new ad to air in Iowa, Sanders has gone full Simon & Garfunkel:
   America was released 48 years ago.  
Donald Trump dished last night on CNN on what it was like to stand next to Sarah Palin during the rambling 20-minute speech she gave to endorse him on Tuesday. 
 "I didn't know it was going to be quite that long,"  Trump said.
... but she made a beautiful, you know, she made a very good speech. No, I wasn't uncomfortable - I was very happy. I would have normally left the stage and let her speak ... I thought it would be disrespectful to her if I left the stage. So, no, I wasn't uncomfortable at all."
He doesn't look uncomfortable in this mashup:
Trump spent part of Wednesday hammering Texas senator Ted Cruz, seemingly his closest rival in Iowa, which votes in just 11 days' time. 
This morning it appears the Republican establishment has picked a horse in the Trump-Cruz race - and it is Trump.  Bob Dole, the former senator and presidential nominee, told the New York Times Republicans would suffer "cataclysmic" losses with Cruz and that Trump would be better.
 Trent Lott, the former Senate majority  leader, told the Atlantic he'd take Trump over Cruz if he had to choose. Trump himself pointed out that "Everybody dislikes [Cruz]. I mean, he's a nasty guy that everybody dislikes."
 Cruz hit back, saying there actually is a new alignment between Trump and the establishment - difficult to argue, except in the case of a Trump-Cruz race - and trying to use it against Trump.
"Right now the Washington establishment is  abandoning Marco Rubio, they made an assessment that Marco can't win this race, and the Washington establishment is rushing over to support Donald Trump," Cruz told Politico.

Fear of whistleblowing at BBC allowed Jimmy Savile to abuse, says leaked report; 
Lawyer for Jimmy Savile's victims says she finds it hard to believe management had no idea he was a danger.

A widespread fear of whistleblowing among BBC staff allowed disgraced presenter Jimmy Savile to abuse girls and boys "in virtually every corner" of the broadcaster's premises without senior management being aware, a leaked draft report says.
Dame Janet Smith, who led the review into Savile's sexual misconduct at the BBC, said in the early version of her report that a reluctance to complain to senior management among BBC staff that existed in the 1970s and 1980s still remains today. 
As a result there is no evidence that any report of abuse "reached the ears or the desk" of senior staff - despite more than 100 individuals, including BBC workers, coming forward with tales of Savile's abuse.
But Liz Dux, a lawyer at Slater and Gordon who represents 168 of Savile's victims, found this conclusion was "not credible", telling the Guardian: "It beggars belief that given what was going onand with so many witnesses giving evidence to her of their suspicions and knowledge, 107 in total, that for her to conclude a lack of knowledge on the part of management and an acceptance of their inability to stop him I don't find is credible. I can't accept that on behalf of my clients." 
In the 53-page report, Smith also appears to excuse one producer for failing to flag concerns about Savile to avoid "painful consequences" of tackling such issues because he was a "creature of his time". 
Smith says producer missed several warnings that Savile was a threat, such as an incident when he heard Savile shout "Legal! Legal!" when hearing that a young girl was aged 16 and observed inappropriate conduct with staff, such as hand and arm licking.
However, Smith steps back from admonishing the producer because "tackling such issues would have been very painful" as senior management put great stock in the show's rating.
Among the rumours heard by the review were claims Savile was a paedophile, a necrophiliac, abused disabled people and took girls to his caravan to abuse them. However, none of the witnesses reported it to BBC management.
Some 45 victims gave evidence of "inappropriate physical sexual conduct" by Savile, including a woman who was nine at the time. Most of the women were over 16 when they were sexually assaulted by the DJ, the draft report says, but all the boys except one were under that age.
Incidents took place "in virtually every corner of the BBC premises" where Savile worked, according to the draft report, but all except one of the rapes and attempted rapes took place at the DJ's own flat or caravan. 
The very first victim who gave evidence to the review, known only as C1, described how she was aged 15 and doing work experience in the BBC's Broadcasting House canteen when she met Savile in 1986. 
The DJ asked her if she would have a cup of tea with him when she finished her work. When she agreed, he took her to his flat at 22 Park Crescent and raped her, the review says. 
When his star was rising in the early to mid-70s, Savile had a group of teenage fans - whom he called his "team" or "London team" - whom he would meet outside BBC studios and take back to his flat for sex. 
The report describes how one of the girls, called Angie, first met Savile in 1968 when she was 15 and he was 42. He raped her, telling her afterwards that she was not a virgin any more, it says. 
Six years later, Savile gave Angie a signed copy of his autobiography As It Happens with the inscrption: "[Angie's name] of the Team. No Escape. Belongs to Jimmy Savile her keeper".
The report includes examples where BBC employees allegedly advised Savile's victims not to report their assaults. On one occasion, in 1970, a 19-year-old BBC Leeds worker was raped by Savile in his camper van outside Kings Cross train station in London after going for a drink with her colleagues, Mike Hollingsworth and Alan Shaw. 
The woman, named C5, told Hollingsworth and Shaw what had happened and they were "sympathetic but advised her not to make any formal report", the draft report says. Both Hollingsworth, who worked for BBC Leeds, and Shaw, from BBC Teesside, are now dead and were not interviewed by the Smith review team.
Smith said there were a number of "wake up calls" that sexual misconduct was taking place at the Top of the Pops studios but this was ignored by the BBC. 
The first, in 1969, was related to Top of the Pops photographer Harry Goodwin, now deceased, who allegedly took pornographic photos of teenage girls in his dressing room.
The next wake-up call in 1971 related to the death of Claire McAlpine, a teenager who committed suicide shortly after claiming she was assaulted by an unnamed BBC DJ.
An assistant floor manager on Top of the Pops from about 1969 to 1971 told the review that the show was "an extraordinary mixture of sleaze and innocence". Another said Savile's dressing room always seemed full of "kids".
But Smith says she does not believe senior management was made aware of Savile's abuse. "In the testosterone-laden atmosphere, where everyone was, in theory at least, over the age of 16, child protection was simply not a live issue," she says. "No one noticed what Savile was doing; he was able to hide in plain sight."
Smith also said: "There is still a widespread reluctance to complain about anything" at the BBC for fear of their positions. "It was explained to me that, in one respect, the position is even worse today than it was years ago in that so many people are now employed on short-term contracts or on a freelance basis, with little or no job security," she said.
Following on from this, it was Smith's view that it is possible that "predatory child abuser could be lurking undiscovered in the BBC even today". Following the leak, Smith released a statement describing the version of the report as "out of date" and said significant changes had been made to the final report, due to be released in six weeks' time. 
 Tony Hall, director general of the BBC, said the child abuse scandal was a "dark chapter in the history of the BBC" and vowed to make sure nothing like it happens again. 
In her final afterword, Smith insists no senior staff could have been made aware of Savile's misconduct. 
"There is no evidence that any report of physical sexual misconduct or inappropriate behaviour ever reached the ears or the desk of a senior producer or an executive producer let alone a head of department or other senior executive."

My gay ancestor's fate shows how dangerous political witch-hunts can be; 
Inquiries based on sexual behaviour can take on a terrifying life of their own - just as happened after events in Dublin 120 years ago.

David Boyle.

I always knew my family was basically Irish - Irish Protestant, it has to be said - and I always knew the old story about how my banker great-great-grandfather escaped from Dublin wearing a false nose in 1884. Why he went, and what he was afraid of, remained lost in the mists of time - except that his photo was torn out of the family album.

But now that Victorian newspapers can be read online, I have finally been able to uncover some clues. And following them has led me on a strange journey that sheds some light on the genesis of discriminatory laws and the dangerous business of politicians' witch-hunts, and where they can lead.
I was looking for something else entirely when I absentmindedly put the name Richard Boyle into the search engine at the British Library, and read for the first time the phrase " Dublin scandals ", which dominated the Irish press that summer.
As it turned out, the Dublin scandals - now all but forgotten - have their own legacy of intolerance in UK law, and led directly to the notorious LabouchËre amendment the following year, 1885, which outlawed all homosexual behaviour among men. The law wasn't repealed until 1967, and among those prosecuted under it were John Gielgud and Alan Turing. Turing took his own life; so did hundreds, and possibly thousands, of others.
The story goes back to the Phoenix Park murders of 1882, when republican terrorists stabbed the Irish secretary to death - accidentally, as it turned out: he happened to be walking with the intended victim. The murders shocked the public on both sides of the Irish Sea, and to claw back the moral high ground Irish nationalist MPs launched a campaign to identify homosexuals in the Irish government or part of the establishment in Dublin - starting with the senior detective in charge of the Phoenix Park case, James Ellis French. The campaign led to huge torchlight processions and mass demonstrations in many towns and cities of Ireland.
The scandals barely ruffled feathers in London, except among political friends of their parliamentary leader, Parnell
Most of the defendants were acquitted - the main issue at stake was whether it was physically possible to commit sodomy in a hansom cab - but by then my great-great-grandfather had fled, first to Madrid and then to south London. The scandals barely ruffled feathers in London, except among campaigners linked to the Irish nationalist cause, or political friends of their parliamentary leader, Charles Stewart Parnell. Among these, the maverick radical Henry LabouchËre was particularly frustrated that sodomy had been so difficult to prove.
So when the opportunity arose the following summer, as the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 - designed to raise the age of consent for women from 12 - crawled through parliament, LabouchËre seized his chance. His amendment was debated at night in a few minutes, and only one MP queried whether it was relevant to the debate. But for the next eight decades, it put men - and it only applied to men - in a perilous position if they loved another of their sex.
There are lessons today about the dangers of political witch-hunts about sexual behaviour, the stock-in-trade of politicians since time immemorial. Whatever the arguments for investigating child sex abuse by the establishment, for example - and we do have to investigate - if it is used to drag down people for political reasons, these campaigns can take on a terrifying life of their own, as the events in Dublin showed.

                     As for my ancestor, just beyond the horizon of memory, I felt reluctant to search for what he had tried so hard to hide, but I couldn't leave the trail alone. I tracked him to a new career as a stained glass artist, in the glass industry in Camberwell. Among other revelations was that he was living with a man who was with him when he died, during the terrible London smog of Christmas week 1900.
But there is another lesson about sexual witch-hunts. He disappeared from his home and all published records again a second time, this time in 1895. Contemporary letters imply the same of many others - maybe many hundreds of them. One correspondent reported that there were 600 passengers queuing for the Calais ferry the night Oscar Wilde was arrested that April.
It may be that this was an unprecedented moment of fear in modern UK history - one of the few times people have fled (if they were wealthy enough) from London to Paris, rather than the other way round. It may even have been a unique, forgotten moment of intolerance and fear in our history. And all because of a political witch-hunt that began, for very different reasons, in Dublin 11 years before. We still have to learn to be careful.

Accounting watchdog weighs up inquiry into KPMG's audit of HBOS; 
Financial Reporting Council's conduct committee asks head of enforcement to investigate the signing off of HBOS's books for 2007.

Sean Farrell.

The Financial Reporting Council is considering an investigation into KPMG's auditing of HBOS, the bank that almost collapsed at the peak of the financial crisis. 
The accounting regulator said its conduct committee had asked its head of enforcement, Gareth Rees, to make inquiries into whether KPMG committed misconduct when it signed off HBOS's books for 2007.

Rees will examine whether it was correct for KPMG to allow HBOS to be classed as a going concern in its 2007 accounts, and whether major worries about the bank's viability should have been included in the financial statements. 
Rees's inquiries are preliminary and may not lead to a full inquiry but the decision to start the process represents a significant step amid political pressure for a full investigation of KPMG's role. If a full inquiry goes ahead, the firm and individual accountants who worked on HBOS could face punishment.
HBOS, which traded as Halifax and Bank of Scotland, was forced to ask shareholders for £4bn to prop up its finances in April 2008  just two months after its annual accounts gave it a clean bill of health. The bank almost imploded in September 2008 and was rescued by Lloyds in a government-engineered takeover. The combined bank was bailed out by taxpayers a month later at a cost of £20bn. 
The FRC said it asked Rees to investigate after reading  a report by financial regulators into HBOS's collapse published in November. The FRC has already looked at HBOS's bad debt provisions and decided there were not grounds for a full investigation but it has come under pressure to look further into KPMG's conduct.
After the HBOS report was published, Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury committee, criticised the FRC for not conducting a full investigation into KPMG's auditing of HBOS. Tyrie wrote to the council urging them to get on with an investigation quickly. 
Tyrie said on Thursday: "This is not before time. A great deal depends on the quality of audited accounts. They were found wanting during the financial crisis. It is essential that everybody fully understands why. That is why this investigation is so important. The committee will be keeping a close eye on it."
Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors business lobby group, said it was essential that investors had faith in the audited accounts of UK companies and that the FRC needed to conduct a thorough review to maintain confidence.
Walker said: "Shareholders and customers deserve to know what role the firm's auditors, KPMG, played in this scandal. External audits must be rigorous and fit for purpose, especially when it comes to systemically important and bewilderingly complex financial institutions. 
"There is more at stake here than just the integrity of a few regulators and the inquiry cannot just be about spreading blame. Shareholders need confidence in the financial statements offered by companies and they have a right to know that auditors are properly scrutinising the books."
A spokesman for KPMG, one of the big four accountancy firms, said it supported a thorough review of the HBOS affair and that it was important for conclusions to be reached speedily. 
He added: "We were pleased that the [Prudential Regulation Authority] and Financial Conduct Authority] report issued last November recognised that KPMG provided robust challenge and delivered clear warnings to HBOS and that this resulted in a more prudent approach to provisioning than would otherwise have been adopted. We will continue to cooperate with the FRC as it makes its preliminary enquiries."
