 European markets close higher  
Ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest rate setting meeting, and following a rise in the oil price, European shares have ended the day on a positive note. 
With hopes of co-operation between oil producers - notable Opec and Russia - to tackle the issue of oversupply, Brent crude has jumped 3.6% to $32.96. The rise comes despite  a jump in US crude inventories . The closing scores showed:

The FTSE 100 finished 78.91 points or 1.33% higher at 5990.37
Germany's Dax added 0.59% to 9880.82
France's Cac climbed 0.54% to 4380.36
Spain's Ibex ended up 0.56% at 8741.0
Italy's FTSE MIB was an exception, dipping 0.4% to 18,848.03
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 34 points or 0.22% higher.

 Another reason for the day's strength in the oil price: Russia has said it discussed co-operation with Opec over crude prices. Reuters reports:
Russia's energy ministry said possible coordination between Russia and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was discussed at a meeting with Russian oil companies on Wednesday.
The ministry said the discussion was related to unfavourable oil prices.
There is also talk of an emergency Opec meeting in February.

Markets are moving higher on the back of the improvement in the oil price. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct said:
The threat of the early sell-off for oil prices this morning failed to materialise with crude bouncing above the $30 mark and this has in turn lent a raft of support to equity markets on both sides of the Atlantic. Even what could at best be described as a mixed bag in terms of US oil inventory data has failed to knock sentiment so London's FTSE-100 is rounding off the day - where we tested highs not seen for two weeks - with a bullish tone. Next up however it's the latest Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting and anything that is interpreted as being overly hawkish here could readily unseat equity markets globally that are still clearly rattled by recent events.

 US crude stocks rise to new high  
Elsewhere, US crude stocks rose to their highest level on record - ie back to 1930 - last week while gasoline stocks increased but inventories of distillates fell.
The figure for distillates, which include heating oil, follows the cold front hitting the country in the past few days. Distillate inventories fell by 4.1m barrels compared to expectations of a near 2m fall.
But crude stocks climbed by 8.4m barrels last week, well above expectations of a 3.3m increase, to 494.9m, the highest level since the Energy Information Administration began compiling records.
Refinery crude runs fell by 551,000 barrels a day.
Gasoline stocks climbed by 3.5m barrels compared to forecsats of a 1.5m increase.
But despite the rises, Brent crude is up 0.79% at $32.05 a barrel. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:
 US crude oil inventories rose by the highest level since April 2015 last week, pushing overall oil in storage to near levels not seen in 80 years for this time of year.
Crucially, we did see domestic production fall ever so slightly. This distinction highlights the reaction in global trade, which has seen oil prices rise off the back of seemingly bearish headline data. With sentiment driven by record output from Iraq and Russia, alongside the entry of Iran on the mainstream oil market, any news that US output is starting to turn lower is certainly welcome for oil bulls.

 The Federal Reserve is holding its first meeting since December's now-contentious decision to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. 
The subsequent market turmoil, focused on a slowdown in China and the tumbling oil price, has made many wonder whether the Fed was a bit premature in pulling the rate trigger.
The Fed is highly unlikely to change rates at this meeting, and there is no press conference for Fed chair Janet Yellen to be quizzed about her thoughts on the aftermath of last month's move. So the statement accompanying the rate decision is likely to be scrutinised for clues as to the Fed's latest thinking.
It must surely acknowledge the market slump and fears of a global downturn which have increased since December, and may even hint that it no longer expects three or four more rate rises this year. The wording of its comments on the current state of the global economy will be key, but analysts are divided on what the Fed's tone will be.
Simon Smith, chief economist at FXPro said:
All eyes will be back on the Federal Reserve today as they make their first interest rate decision and monetary policy statement of the year but there are no economic projections or press conference this time round, which come at the next meeting in March. We've seen a rise in risk appetite in this final week of January which so far has been a bit of a blood bath, although the recovery from lows in many indices has softened the blow for many investors. This has come as a result of a bounce in oil prices but also a growing expectation that central banks will have to do more to support the global economy.
Today's Fed meeting as a result is likely to see a more dovish tone to it, especially since the market consensus is that we will see fewer rate hikes this year than the Fed is currently pencilling in.
Even though we saw a higher than expected rise in US consumer confidence yesterday a big warning shot has come from one of the world's largest companies Apple which saw its first fall in revenue since 2003.

But lya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, said:
The rate-setting FOMC committee is broadly expected to keep the benchmark lending rate unchanged this time around. Indeed, priced-in probability of an increase is a mere 14.3%. This puts the spotlight on the text of the statement accompanying the rate decision and the forward guidance contained therein.
Investors appear positioned for a dovish outcome having scaled back 2016 tightening bets amid risk aversion since the beginning of the year...
For its part, the Fed will have to attempt a difficult balancing act. On one hand, it will have to acknowledge recent market turmoil as well as softening US growth dynamics in the final months of 2015. On the other, it will have to re-focus investors' attention on mandate-relevant fundamentals and establish the possibility of tightening in March. This is necessary so that such a move, if deemed appropriate, does not trigger an overly violent response.
On balance, the case for policy normalization remains compelling. Realized and expected inflation is firming: the latest readings on core year-on-year CPI and hourly earnings growth registered at multi-year highs while 2-3 year breakeven rates have trended upward since August. On the jobs front, the unemployment rate is at the lowest level since 2008 and nonfarm payrolls growth is running at a reasonably brisk pace, with the 12-month trend average at 220k.
This means that the Fed statement will have to reassure investors that it will adjust policy if market stress infects the real economy. In the same breath, it will have to explain that as of now, the projected rate hike path has not materially changed since the first post-QE rate hike in December. 
The markets' subsequent reaction will depend on the degree of wishful thinking that traders are prepared to entertain. If they emphasize the first point - a possible result considering the dovish shift in expectations in spite of the aforementioned fundamental evidence - risk appetite is likely to strengthen. This will see the stocks rising alongside sentiment-geared currencies like the Australian and New Zealand Dollars while the greenback as well as the anti-risk Euro and Yen decline. A focus on the second point will probably deliver the opposite result.

Meanwhile the recovery in crude has helped support stock markets. Both the FTSE 100 and Germany's Dax are marginally in positive territory after earlier falls, while France's Cac is only narrowly down.

 Ben van Beurden is upbeat about today's vote, despite the small revolt.
Shell's CEO says:
"I am delighted with the positive shareholder vote and the confidence that shareholders have shown in the strategic logic of the combination of Shell and BG. 
Our immediate focus is on the successful completion of the transaction and we now await the results of tomorrow's BG shareholder vote.
Assuming BG's shareholders approve the deal ( they will ), Shell will become the world's biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) trader.

 It's worth reiterating that 17% of Shell shareholders opposed the BG merger at today's vote. 
That suggests that some big City investors have reservations about the deal, despite Shell chief Ben van Beurden's best efforts to persuade them of its merits.

 Standard Life  was the only large investor to go public - their head of equities, David Cumming, reckoned the deal only made sense when oil was over $60 per barrel, not $30ish.
But Standard Life  owned less than 2% of the company, so others have clearly found the deal too risky.
Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, reminds me that even Royal Bank of Scotland's disastrous merger with ABN Amro in October 2007 got the support of 99% of shareholders (who then suffered huge losses). So a 17% revolt may sting, a little.

 Newsflash from The Hague - Royal Dutch Shell shareholders have just voted in favour of its Â£35bn merger with rival oil firm BG. 
That's despite pressure from some shareholders to renegotiate the tie-up, which was negotiated before the oil price slumped to just $30 per barrel.
During the meeting, Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden told the meeting that the deal would be a "springboard to simplify Shell" , the Evening Standard reports.
Van Beurden also argued that a merger still made sense despite the cheaper oil price.
 The deal was approved by 83% of shareholders, with 17% opposing the plan. 
BG investors give their verdict tomorrow, but there's little chance that they will block the deal.

RBS's ability to surprise investors with fresh bad news has been one of the hardy perennials of the past six years, and yet still the news keeps coming. George Osborne's decision to sell a chunk of the government's stake last August, which was derided at the time, now looks like a sound financial decision, but it does mean any further sales are essentially off the table.
Coincidentally, with Lloyds down 2% this morning in sympathy, it seems the government will remain a key asset manager when it comes to UK banks.

 RBS CEO promises 'clean-up' after Â£2.5bn profits hit  
If you're just tuning in, here's Jill Treanor's news story about the latest problems at RBS:
 RBS takes Â£2.5bn hit to profits as chief executive announces bank 'clean-up' 
Royal Bank of Scotland is set to report its eighth consecutive year of full-year losses after announcing a string of charges for legal bills, compensation and a pension payment.
The bank, which is more than 70%-owned by the taxpayer, said it would take a Â£2.5bn hit to profits in 2015 as a result of a clean-up exercise, driving its share price to a three-year low in Wednesday's early trading. 
RBS shares fell 5% to 246p - below the 330p at which George Osborne sold off the the government's first tranche of shares in August, and less than half the 502p average price at which taxpayers pumped Â£45bn into the bank.
Issuing an unscheduled trading update on Wednesday, Ross McEwan, the chief executive of RBS, said the move was part of a continued clean-up but conceded that that the bank would make another full-year loss for 2015. It has not reported a profit since 2007.

"I am determined to put the issues of the past behind us, and make sure RBS is a stronger, safer bank. We will now continue to move further and faster in 2016 to clean up the bank and improve our core businesses," said McEwan.
"We've always been open about the scale of past issues facing RBS and although there is clearly much more to do, this announcement is a further step towards addressing legacy issues and building a great bank for our customers and delivering long-term value for our shareholders," he added.....

 The latest problems at RBS show that bankers need keeping on a tight leash, argues campaigners for a financial transaction tax. 
David Hillman, spokesperson for the Robin Hood Tax campaign, says: 
"It's groundhog day in the City as RBS announces yet another huge provision for dodgy dealing and fleecing its customers. 
"Try as it might, the banking sector is incapable of shaking off its past sins. The government must take note - now is not the time for it to ease up on financial sector reform."
There are signs that Britain is taking a softer line with the City. An inquiry into banking culture was curiously abandoned at the end of last year, alarming campaigners.

 A quick explanation. When RBS says it is setting aside Â£1.5bn to cover "various US residential mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS") litigation claims", it is referring to one of the more noxious elements of the 2007-08 financial crisis.
In the build-up to the crisis, milions of mortgages were sold to US citizens with shaky credit histories, who could not really afford them. Those loans were repackaged by investment banks into new financial products (the RMBSs) and sold onto investors who weren't told how dangerous they might be.
Cue the credit crunch, and the collapse of the subprime market. Mortgage-backed securities plunged in value, as the borrowers behind them failed to meet their payments and handed back the key to their homes.
And the smaller banks, credit unions, insurers and suchlike who had been left holding them when the music stopped ( and the Big Short paid out ) launched waves of legal action against Wall Street.
RBS had a finger in this unsavoury pie though its US subsidiary, Greenwich Capital Markets. In 2013, the SEC accused it of "misleading investors" and cutting corners, by selling loans that didn't meet underwriting guidelines.
block-time updated-timeUpdated at 9.21am GMT
block-time published-time 8.53am GMT 
 Important point: The Â£1.5bn in new US legal charges announced by RBS this morning does not cover any potential settlements with the US Department of Justice, or various US State Attorney General investigations.
Ian Gordon of Investec warns that:
The timing and the cost of resolving those cases remains highly uncertain.
block-time published-time 8.39am GMT 
 City analysts are punting out their opinions now. 
And Sandy Chen of Cenkos Securities isn't too alarmed by RBS's announcement. He argues that the bank is simply cleaning up the mess of previous eras ( or possibly 'previous errors' ).
The new Â£1.5bn provision against US mortgage-backed security costs brings the total bill to Â£3.8bn - "closer to the Â£4-6bn totals that most analysts have had in mind", Chen says.
And the Â£500m payment protection insurance top-up should be one of the last big ones, given the FCA's consultation on a 2018/19 time-bar on PPI claims, Chen adds.
His conclusion:
Bad news - really? More like putting their past in their behind, as Pumba said (in the Lion King).

 The UK government currently owns almost 73% of RBS, and at today's share price I fear we're stuck with it for some time. 
The taxpayer paid around 502p per share when it bailed the stricken bank out in 2008. 
Today, RBS shares are trading at just 250p, so we would take a stonking loss if George Osborne sells another slice of the bank.
Last summer, he sold Â£2.1bn of stock at around 320p - crystallising a Â£1bn loss for the taxpayer. That deal was criticised, but with hindsight the hedge funds who bought the stock are now sitting on a loss themselves.

"I am determined to put the issues of the past behind us and make sure RBS is a stronger, safer bank. We will now continue to move further and faster in 2016 to clean-up the bank and improve our core businesses.
We've always been open about the scale of past issues facing RBS and although there is clearly much more to do, this announcement is a further step towards addressing legacy issues and building a great bank for our customers and delivering long term value for our shareholders."

 The agenda: Oil, markets, and then the Fed  
 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets the eurozone, and business. 
Two things dominate today -- the turmoil in the stock markets, and the first US Federal Reserve interest rate decision of 2016.
Traders can't take their eye off the oil price, which is lurching around the $30 per dollar mark this week. Brent crude is currently trading around $31.42 per barrel, helped by rumours that Russia and Saudi Arabia might carve up some kind of deal to cut production. It's all a bit flaky, though.
 Michael Hewson  of CMC Markets explains:
The symbiotic relationship between equity markets and oil prices continued yesterday as after a rocky start to trading saw a slide in oil prices below $30 drag equity markets lower, the lack of follow through saw a semblance of stability return and a sharp recovery back above the $30 level on vague chatter that senior OPEC officials were looking to open a dialogue and put together some form of deal with Russia in an effort to put a floor under prices.
 European markets are likely to be calm this morning, as investors await new from America's central bank. 
At 7pm GMT tonight, the Federal Reserve announces its decision on monetary policy. It will surely (surely!) leave interest rates unchanged, having made the first symbolic post-crisis hike last month. 
The Fed's statement will be scrutinised for its view on the global economy, and any signs of 'hikers' remorse', given the turmoil in the markets in recent weeks.

Markets are moving higher on the back of the improvement in the oil price. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct said:
The threat of the early sell-off for oil prices this morning failed to materialise with crude bouncing above the $30 mark and this has in turn lent a raft of support to equity markets on both sides of the Atlantic. Even what could at best be described as a mixed bag in terms of US oil inventory data has failed to knock sentiment so London's FTSE-100 is rounding off the day - where we tested highs not seen for two weeks - with a bullish tone. Next up however it's the latest Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting and anything that is interpreted as being overly hawkish here could readily unseat equity markets globally that are still clearly rattled by recent events.

 US crude stocks rise to new high   
Elsewhere, US crude stocks rose to their highest level on record - ie back to 1930 - last week while gasoline stocks increased but inventories of distillates fell.
The figure for distillates, which include heating oil, follows the cold front hitting the country in the past few days. Distillate inventories fell by 4.1m barrels compared to expectations of a near 2m fall.
But crude stocks climbed by 8.4m barrels last week, well above expectations of a 3.3m increase, to 494.9m, the highest level since the Energy Information Administration began compiling records.
Refinery crude runs fell by 551,000 barrels a day.
Gasoline stocks climbed by 3.5m barrels compared to forecsats of a 1.5m increase.
But despite the rises, Brent crude is up 0.79% at $32.05 a barrel. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said:
 US crude oil inventories rose by the highest level since April 2015 last week, pushing overall oil in storage to near levels not seen in 80 years for this time of year.
Crucially, we did see domestic production fall ever so slightly. This distinction highlights the reaction in global trade, which has seen oil prices rise off the back of seemingly bearish headline data. With sentiment driven by record output from Iraq and Russia, alongside the entry of Iran on the mainstream oil market, any news that US output is starting to turn lower is certainly welcome for oil bulls.

 The Federal Reserve is holding its first meeting since December's now-contentious decision to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. 
The subsequent market turmoil, focused on a slowdown in China and the tumbling oil price, has made many wonder whether the Fed was a bit premature in pulling the rate trigger.
The Fed is highly unlikely to change rates at this meeting, and there is no press conference for Fed chair Janet Yellen to be quizzed about her thoughts on the aftermath of last month's move. So the statement accompanying the rate decision is likely to be scrutinised for clues as to the Fed's latest thinking.
It must surely acknowledge the market slump and fears of a global downturn which have increased since December, and may even hint that it no longer expects three or four more rate rises this year. The wording of its comments on the current state of the global economy will be key, but analysts are divided on what the Fed's tone will be.
Simon Smith, chief economist at FXPro said:
All eyes will be back on the Federal Reserve today as they make their first interest rate decision and monetary policy statement of the year but there are no economic projections or press conference this time round, which come at the next meeting in March. We've seen a rise in risk appetite in this final week of January which so far has been a bit of a blood bath, although the recovery from lows in many indices has softened the blow for many investors. This has come as a result of a bounce in oil prices but also a growing expectation that central banks will have to do more to support the global economy.
Today's Fed meeting as a result is likely to see a more dovish tone to it, especially since the market consensus is that we will see fewer rate hikes this year than the Fed is currently pencilling in.
Even though we saw a higher than expected rise in US consumer confidence yesterday a big warning shot has come from one of the world's largest companies Apple which saw its first fall in revenue since 2003.

But lya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, said:
The rate-setting FOMC committee is broadly expected to keep the benchmark lending rate unchanged this time around. Indeed, priced-in probability of an increase is a mere 14.3%. This puts the spotlight on the text of the statement accompanying the rate decision and the forward guidance contained therein.
Investors appear positioned for a dovish outcome having scaled back 2016 tightening bets amid risk aversion since the beginning of the year...
For its part, the Fed will have to attempt a difficult balancing act. On one hand, it will have to acknowledge recent market turmoil as well as softening US growth dynamics in the final months of 2015. On the other, it will have to re-focus investors' attention on mandate-relevant fundamentals and establish the possibility of tightening in March. This is necessary so that such a move, if deemed appropriate, does not trigger an overly violent response.
On balance, the case for policy normalization remains compelling. Realized and expected inflation is firming: the latest readings on core year-on-year CPI and hourly earnings growth registered at multi-year highs while 2-3 year breakeven rates have trended upward since August. On the jobs front, the unemployment rate is at the lowest level since 2008 and nonfarm payrolls growth is running at a reasonably brisk pace, with the 12-month trend average at 220k.
This means that the Fed statement will have to reassure investors that it will adjust policy if market stress infects the real economy. In the same breath, it will have to explain that as of now, the projected rate hike path has not materially changed since the first post-QE rate hike in December. 
The markets' subsequent reaction will depend on the degree of wishful thinking that traders are prepared to entertain. If they emphasize the first point - a possible result considering the dovish shift in expectations in spite of the aforementioned fundamental evidence - risk appetite is likely to strengthen. This will see the stocks rising alongside sentiment-geared currencies like the Australian and New Zealand Dollars while the greenback as well as the anti-risk Euro and Yen decline. A focus on the second point will probably deliver the opposite result.

 Ben van Beurden is upbeat about today's vote, despite the small revolt.
Shell's CEO says:
"I am delighted with the positive shareholder vote and the confidence that shareholders have shown in the strategic logic of the combination of Shell and BG. 
Our immediate focus is on the successful completion of the transaction and we now await the results of tomorrow's BG shareholder vote.
Assuming BG's shareholders approve the deal ( they will ), Shell will become the world's biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) trader.

 It's worth reiterating that 17% of Shell shareholders opposed the BG merger at today's vote.

 Standard Life  was the only large investor to go public - their head of equities, David Cumming, reckoned the deal only made sense when oil was over $60 per barrel, not $30ish.
But Standard Life  owned less than 2% of the company, so others have clearly found the deal too risky.
Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, reminds me that even Royal Bank of Scotland's disastrous merger with ABN Amro in October 2007 got the support of 99% of shareholders (who then suffered huge losses). So a 17% revolt may sting, a little.

 Newsflash from The Hague - Royal Dutch Shell shareholders have just voted in favour of its Â£35bn merger with rival oil firm BG.

During the meeting, Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden told the meeting that the deal would be a "springboard to simplify Shell" , the Evening Standard reports.
Van Beurden also argued that a merger still made sense despite the cheaper oil price.
 The deal was approved by 83% of shareholders, with 17% opposing the plan. 
BG investors give their verdict tomorrow, but there's little chance that they will block the deal.

RBS's ability to surprise investors with fresh bad news has been one of the hardy perennials of the past six years, and yet still the news keeps coming. George Osborne's decision to sell a chunk of the government's stake last August, which was derided at the time, now looks like a sound financial decision, but it does mean any further sales are essentially off the table.

 RBS CEO promises 'clean-up' after Â£2.5bn profits hit  
If you're just tuning in, here's Jill Treanor's news story about the latest problems at RBS:
 RBS takes Â£2.5bn hit to profits as chief executive announces bank 'clean-up' 
Royal Bank of Scotland is set to report its eighth consecutive year of full-year losses after announcing a string of charges for legal bills, compensation and a pension payment.
The bank, which is more than 70%-owned by the taxpayer, said it would take a Â£2.5bn hit to profits in 2015 as a result of a clean-up exercise, driving its share price to a three-year low in Wednesday's early trading. 
RBS shares fell 5% to 246p - below the 330p at which George Osborne sold off the the government's first tranche of shares in August, and less than half the 502p average price at which taxpayers pumped Â£45bn into the bank.
Issuing an unscheduled trading update on Wednesday, Ross McEwan, the chief executive of RBS, said the move was part of a continued clean-up but conceded that that the bank would make another full-year loss for 2015. It has not reported a profit since 2007.

 The latest problems at RBS show that bankers need keeping on a tight leash, argues campaigners for a financial transaction tax. 
David Hillman, spokesperson for the Robin Hood Tax campaign, says: 
"It's groundhog day in the City as RBS announces yet another huge provision for dodgy dealing and fleecing its customers. 
"Try as it might, the banking sector is incapable of shaking off its past sins. The government must take note - now is not the time for it to ease up on financial sector reform."
There are signs that Britain is taking a softer line with the City. An inquiry into banking culture was curiously abandoned at the end of last year, alarming campaigners.

 A quick explanation. When RBS says it is setting aside Â£1.5bn to cover "various US residential mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS") litigation claims", it is referring to one of the more noxious elements of the 2007-08 financial crisis.
In the build-up to the crisis, milions of mortgages were sold to US citizens with shaky credit histories, who could not really afford them. Those loans were repackaged by investment banks into new financial products (the RMBSs) and sold onto investors who weren't told how dangerous they might be.
Cue the credit crunch, and the collapse of the subprime market. Mortgage-backed securities plunged in value, as the borrowers behind them failed to meet their payments and handed back the key to their homes.
And the smaller banks, credit unions, insurers and suchlike who had been left holding them when the music stopped ( and the Big Short paid out ) launched waves of legal action against Wall Street.
RBS had a finger in this unsavoury pie though its US subsidiary, Greenwich Capital Markets. In 2013, the SEC accused it of "misleading investors" and cutting corners, by selling loans that didn't meet underwriting guidelines.
block-time updated-timeUpdated at 9.21am GMT
block-time published-time 8.53am GMT 
 Important point: The Â£1.5bn in new US legal charges announced by RBS this morning does not cover any potential settlements with the US Department of Justice, or various US State Attorney General investigations.
Ian Gordon of Investec warns that:
The timing and the cost of resolving those cases remains highly uncertain.
block-time published-time 8.39am GMT 
 City analysts are punting out their opinions now. 
And Sandy Chen of Cenkos Securities isn't too alarmed by RBS's announcement. He argues that the bank is simply cleaning up the mess of previous eras ( or possibly 'previous errors' ).
The new Â£1.5bn provision against US mortgage-backed security costs brings the total bill to Â£3.8bn - "closer to the Â£4-6bn totals that most analysts have had in mind", Chen says.
And the Â£500m payment protection insurance top-up should be one of the last big ones, given the FCA's consultation on a 2018/19 time-bar on PPI claims, Chen adds.
His conclusion:
Bad news - really? More like putting their past in their behind, as Pumba said (in the Lion King).

 The UK government currently owns almost 73% of RBS, and at today's share price I fear we're stuck with it for some time. 
The taxpayer paid around 502p per share when it bailed the stricken bank out in 2008. 
Today, RBS shares are trading at just 250p, so we would take a stonking loss if George Osborne sells another slice of the bank.
Last summer, he sold Â£2.1bn of stock at around 320p - crystallising a Â£1bn loss for the taxpayer. That deal was criticised, but with hindsight the hedge funds who bought the stock are now sitting on a loss themselves.

It is also setting aside an extra Â£500m to cover Payment Protection Insurance ("PPI") claims. That's the long-running mis-selling scandal in which millions of consumers were sold insurance they didn't need (or even ask for, in some cases).
RBS taking a goodwill impairment charge of Â£498m against its Private Banking business.

CEO Ross McEwan insists that he is cleaning up the mess of the past:
"I am determined to put the issues of the past behind us and make sure RBS is a stronger, safer bank. We will now continue to move further and faster in 2016 to clean-up the bank and improve our core businesses.
We've always been open about the scale of past issues facing RBS and although there is clearly much more to do, this announcement is a further step towards addressing legacy issues and building a great bank for our customers and delivering long term value for our shareholders."

 The agenda: Oil, markets, and then the Fed  
 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets the eurozone, and business. 
Two things dominate today -- the turmoil in the stock markets, and the first US Federal Reserve interest rate decision of 2016.
Traders can't take their eye off the oil price, which is lurching around the $30 per dollar mark this week. Brent crude is currently trading around $31.42 per barrel, helped by rumours that Russia and Saudi Arabia might carve up some kind of deal to cut production. It's all a bit flaky, though.
 Michael Hewson  of CMC Markets explains:
The symbiotic relationship between equity markets and oil prices continued yesterday as after a rocky start to trading saw a slide in oil prices below $30 drag equity markets lower, the lack of follow through saw a semblance of stability return and a sharp recovery back above the $30 level on vague chatter that senior OPEC officials were looking to open a dialogue and put together some form of deal with Russia in an effort to put a floor under prices.
 European markets are likely to be calm this morning, as investors await new from America's central bank. 
At 7pm GMT tonight, the Federal Reserve announces its decision on monetary policy. It will surely (surely!) leave interest rates unchanged, having made the first symbolic post-crisis hike last month. 
The Fed's statement will be scrutinised for its view on the global economy, and any signs of 'hikers' remorse', given the turmoil in the markets in recent weeks.

 The Federal Reserve is holding its first meeting since December's now-contentious decision to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. 
The subsequent market turmoil, focused on a slowdown in China and the tumbling oil price, has made many wonder whether the Fed was a bit premature in pulling the rate trigger.
The Fed is highly unlikely to change rates at this meeting, and there is no press conference for Fed chair Janet Yellen to be quizzed about her thoughts on the aftermath of last month's move. So the statement accompanying the rate decision is likely to be scrutinised for clues as to the Fed's latest thinking.
It must surely acknowledge the market slump and fears of a global downturn which have increased since December, and may even hint that it no longer expects three or four more rate rises this year. The wording of its comments on the current state of the global economy will be key, but analysts are divided on what the Fed's tone will be.
Simon Smith, chief economist at FXPro said:
All eyes will be back on the Federal Reserve today as they make their first interest rate decision and monetary policy statement of the year but there are no economic projections or press conference this time round, which come at the next meeting in March. We've seen a rise in risk appetite in this final week of January which so far has been a bit of a blood bath, although the recovery from lows in many indices has softened the blow for many investors. This has come as a result of a bounce in oil prices but also a growing expectation that central banks will have to do more to support the global economy.
Today's Fed meeting as a result is likely to see a more dovish tone to it, especially since the market consensus is that we will see fewer rate hikes this year than the Fed is currently pencilling in.
Even though we saw a higher than expected rise in US consumer confidence yesterday a big warning shot has come from one of the world's largest companies Apple which saw its first fall in revenue since 2003.

But lya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, said:
The rate-setting FOMC committee is broadly expected to keep the benchmark lending rate unchanged this time around. Indeed, priced-in probability of an increase is a mere 14.3%. This puts the spotlight on the text of the statement accompanying the rate decision and the forward guidance contained therein.
Investors appear positioned for a dovish outcome having scaled back 2016 tightening bets amid risk aversion since the beginning of the year...
For its part, the Fed will have to attempt a difficult balancing act. On one hand, it will have to acknowledge recent market turmoil as well as softening US growth dynamics in the final months of 2015. On the other, it will have to re-focus investors' attention on mandate-relevant fundamentals and establish the possibility of tightening in March. This is necessary so that such a move, if deemed appropriate, does not trigger an overly violent response.
On balance, the case for policy normalization remains compelling. Realized and expected inflation is firming: the latest readings on core year-on-year CPI and hourly earnings growth registered at multi-year highs while 2-3 year breakeven rates have trended upward since August. On the jobs front, the unemployment rate is at the lowest level since 2008 and nonfarm payrolls growth is running at a reasonably brisk pace, with the 12-month trend average at 220k.
This means that the Fed statement will have to reassure investors that it will adjust policy if market stress infects the real economy. In the same breath, it will have to explain that as of now, the projected rate hike path has not materially changed since the first post-QE rate hike in December. 
The markets' subsequent reaction will depend on the degree of wishful thinking that traders are prepared to entertain. If they emphasize the first point - a possible result considering the dovish shift in expectations in spite of the aforementioned fundamental evidence - risk appetite is likely to strengthen. This will see the stocks rising alongside sentiment-geared currencies like the Australian and New Zealand Dollars while the greenback as well as the anti-risk Euro and Yen decline. A focus on the second point will probably deliver the opposite result.

 Ben van Beurden is upbeat about today's vote, despite the small revolt.
Shell's CEO says:
"I am delighted with the positive shareholder vote and the confidence that shareholders have shown in the strategic logic of the combination of Shell and BG. 
Our immediate focus is on the successful completion of the transaction and we now await the results of tomorrow's BG shareholder vote.
Assuming BG's shareholders approve the deal ( they will ), Shell will become the world's biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) trader.

 It's worth reiterating that 17% of Shell shareholders opposed the BG merger at today's vote.

 Standard Life  was the only large investor to go public - their head of equities, David Cumming, reckoned the deal only made sense when oil was over $60 per barrel, not ish$30.
But Standard Life  owned less than 2% of the company, so others have clearly found the deal too risky.
Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, reminds me that even Royal Bank of Scotland's disastrous merger with ABN Amro in October 2007 got the support of 99% of shareholders (who then suffered huge losses). So a 17% revolt may sting, a little.

During the meeting, Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden told the meeting that the deal would be a "springboard to simplify Shell" , the Evening Standard reports.
Van Beurden also argued that a merger still made sense despite the cheaper oil price.
 The deal was approved by 83% of shareholders, with 17% opposing the plan.

RBS's ability to surprise investors with fresh bad news has been one of the hardy perennials of the past six years, and yet still the news keeps coming. George Osborne's decision to sell a chunk of the government's stake last August, which was derided at the time, now looks like a sound financial decision, but it does mean any further sales are essentially off the table.

 RBS CEO promises 'clean-up' after Â£2.5bn profits hit  
If you're just tuning in, here's Jill Treanor's news story about the latest problems at RBS:
 RBS takes Â£2.5bn hit to profits as chief executive announces bank 'clean-up' 
Royal Bank of Scotland is set to report its eighth consecutive year of full-year losses after announcing a string of charges for legal bills, compensation and a pension payment.
The bank, which is more than 70%-owned by the taxpayer, said it would take a Â£2.5bn hit to profits in 2015 as a result of a clean-up exercise, driving its share price to a three-year low in Wednesday's early trading. 
RBS shares fell 5% to 246p - below the 330p at which George Osborne sold off the the government's first tranche of shares in August, and less than half the 502p average price at which taxpayers pumped Â£45bn into the bank.
Issuing an unscheduled trading update on Wednesday, Ross McEwan, the chief executive of RBS, said the move was part of a continued clean-up but conceded that that the bank would make another full-year loss for 2015. It has not reported a profit since 2007.

 The latest problems at RBS show that bankers need keeping on a tight leash, argues campaigners for a financial transaction tax. 
David Hillman, spokesperson for the Robin Hood Tax campaign, says: 
"It's groundhog day in the City as RBS announces yet another huge provision for dodgy dealing and fleecing its customers. 
"Try as it might, the banking sector is incapable of shaking off its past sins. The government must take note - now is not the time for it to ease up on financial sector reform."
There are signs that Britain is taking a softer line with the City. An inquiry into banking culture was curiously abandoned at the end of last year, alarming campaigners.

 A quick explanation. When RBS says it is setting aside Â£1.5bn to cover "various US residential mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS") litigation claims", it is referring to one of the more noxious elements of the 2007-08 financial crisis.
In the build-up to the crisis, milions of mortgages were sold to US citizens with shaky credit histories, who could not really afford them. Those loans were repackaged by investment banks into new financial products (the RMBSs) and sold onto investors who weren't told how dangerous they might be.
Cue the credit crunch, and the collapse of the subprime market. Mortgage-backed securities plunged in value, as the borrowers behind them failed to meet their payments and handed back the key to their homes.
And the smaller banks, credit unions, insurers and suchlike who had been left holding them when the music stopped ( and the Big Short paid out ) launched waves of legal action against Wall Street.
RBS had a finger in this unsavoury pie though its US subsidiary, Greenwich Capital Markets. In 2013, the SEC accused it of "misleading investors" and cutting corners, by selling loans that didn't meet underwriting guidelines.
block-time updated-timeUpdated at 9.21am GMT
block-time published-time 8.53am GMT 
 Important point: The Â£1.5bn in new US legal charges announced by RBS this morning does not cover any potential settlements with the US Department of Justice, or various US State Attorney General investigations.
Ian Gordon of Investec warns that:
The timing and the cost of resolving those cases remains highly uncertain.
block-time published-time 8.39am GMT 
 City analysts are punting out their opinions now. 
And Sandy Chen of Cenkos Securities isn't too alarmed by RBS's announcement. He argues that the bank is simply cleaning up the mess of previous eras ( or possibly 'previous errors' ).
The new Â£1.5bn provision against US mortgage-backed security costs brings the total bill to Â£3.8bn - "closer to the Â£4-6bn totals that most analysts have had in mind", Chen says.
And the Â£500m payment protection insurance top-up should be one of the last big ones, given the FCA's consultation on a 2018/19 time-bar on PPI claims, Chen adds.
His conclusion:
Bad news - really? More like putting their past in their behind, as Pumba said (in the Lion King).

 The UK government currently owns almost 73% of RBS, and at today's share price I fear we're stuck with it for some time. 
The taxpayer paid around 502p per share when it bailed the stricken bank out in 2008. 
Today, RBS shares are trading at just 250p, so we would take a stonking loss if George Osborne sells another slice of the bank.
Last summer, he sold Â£2.1bn of stock at around 320p - crystallising a Â£1bn loss for the taxpayer. That deal was criticised, but with hindsight the hedge funds who bought the stock are now sitting on a loss themselves.

Traders can't take their eye off the oil price, which is lurching around the $30 per dollar mark this week. Brent crude is currently trading around $31.42 per barrel, helped by rumours that Russia and Saudi Arabia might carve up some kind of deal to cut production. It's all a bit flaky, though.
 Michael Hewson  of CMC Markets explains:
The symbiotic relationship between equity markets and oil prices continued yesterday as after a rocky start to trading saw a slide in oil prices below $30 drag equity markets lower, the lack of follow through saw a semblance of stability return and a sharp recovery back above the $30 level on vague chatter that senior OPEC officials were looking to open a dialogue and put together some form of deal with Russia in an effort to put a floor under prices.
 European markets are likely to be calm this morning, as investors await new from America's central bank. 
At 7pm GMT tonight, the Federal Reserve announces its decision on monetary policy. It will surely (surely!) leave interest rates unchanged, having made the first symbolic post-crisis hike last month. 
The Fed's statement will be scrutinised for its view on the global economy, and any signs of 'hikers' remorse', given the turmoil in the markets in recent weeks.

Dickensian
8pm, BBC1
There's much to be admired about Tony Jordan's cunningly plotted take on the characters of Charles Dickens. That's especially true when Stephen Rea's Inspector Bucket, his world-weary demeanour never quite obscuring his belief in justice, is at the centre of events. Tonight's face-off with Fagin (Anton Lesser) crackles with energy, while we see Bucket's softer side in an encounter with a waif. Elsewhere, Compeyson has an uninvited visitor. Continues tomorrow.

The Great Sport Relief Bake Off
8.30pm, BBC1 
"David said to me last night: 'I'm really worried about the technical. What are you going to do?'" Even in reported speech, the PM's pop-culture references don't sound convincing, but by the time the first episode of the celebrity oven-off reaches the technical round - a Paris Brest - Samantha Cameron has already knocked out a perfect tray of vol au vents and is well ahead of the field. Helping her raise money for vulnerable people are EastEnders actor Maddy Hill, comedian Jason Manford and ex-footballer David James. Jack Seale

A Timewatch Guide
9pm, BBC4
This new series looks at how the Beeb has covered matters historical in its documentary coverage. First up, it's Britain's leading henge, Stonehenge, with the ever-zesty Professor Alice Roberts unearthing 70 years' worth of BBC archive footage to tell the story of how historians and archeologists have developed and discredited theories about the site. With astronomers and geologists having also thrown in their two cents, the definitive purpose of the stone circle still remains a tantalising mystery. Ben Arnold

Children Saved From The Nazis: A Hero's Story
10.45pm, BBC1
"The future lies in forgetting the past, not remembering it," said Nicholas Winton. Maybe this is why he kept his remarkable story to himself for 50 years. As a young stockbroker, Winton was aware in 1939 of the plight of Jews in Nazi Germany, and managed to save 669 children thanks to an official-looking "British Committee" he set up to give them safe passage to the UK. In 1988, when his heroism came to light, some survivors met Winton for the first time on the TV show That's Life! David Stubbs

Mary Portas Secret Shopper
8pm, Channel 4
Last in the series of the retail trouble-shooting show. Mary pays the 157 Store near Portsmouth a visit and rolls up her sleeves for a protracted battle amid the clothes rails with owner Andy. His stock is laddish and his style is old. As usual with Portas's shows, she isn't just tackling aesthetics but trying to turn around the oil rig of one man's unwillingness to let go of his past. Will he listen to a clued-up expert with a power bob or will his ears remain deaf to the sensible advice she gives him? Julia Raeside

Madam Secretary
9pm, Sky Living
Season two premiere of US political drama following a Hillary Clinton-esque secretary of state played by TÃa Leoni. Elizabeth steps into the president's shoes when Air Force One mysteriously vanishes in mid-air, while professor husband Henry discovers that intelligence services plan to blackmail one of his students into joining their ranks. Despite newsy nods to flight Mhl0 and Russia's attitude towards homosexuality, House Of Cards this ain't. However, it is a touch more believable than fellow White House serial Scandal.

Do Not Disturb
10pm, Gold
A consciously old-fashioned comedy one-off, with Catherine Tate and Miles Jupp as a couple whose stay in a honeymoon suite might save their marriage, if only ludicrous circumstance doesn't nobble them. There's quality throughout the cast, with Steve Edge and Car Share's Sian Gibson as the hotel staff, but farce is hard to write and this script falls well short. The pace doesn't gather, nothing anyone does is plausible, and the dialogue is littered with dead lines. Cringeworthy, in the wrong way. Jack Seale

FILM CHOICE
Point Blank
(John Boorman, 1967) 9pm, TCM
Boorman's first Hollywood film is part arthouse, part thriller, as lean and hard as its star, Lee Marvin. His Walker is an old-school crook, double-crossed and left for dead on Alcatraz, but returning to seek vengeance and the loot. Aided by moll Angie Dickinson, he moves through a gleaming LA, shadow-like in dark suit. Paul Howlett
Someone To Watch Over Me
(Ridley Scott, 1987) 12.15am, BBC1
Class barriers tumble when lowly cop Tom Berenger has to guard wealthy socialite and state's witness Mimi Rogers, and the two become lovers. It's seductively shot, and the romantic drama works beautifully. The thriller element is less plausible, despite a nervy stalking duel between cop and killer in Rogers's labyrinthine apartment.

More than half of BBC staff do not think bullying cases will be tackled fairly; 
Survey comes in wake of leaked draft of report into Jimmy Savile's abuse at the corporation, which said employees were afraid to speak out.

Mark Sweney and Tara Conlan.

More than half of BBC staff do not believe that cases of bullying or harassment would be tackled fairly by the corporation's management.
Just 47% of employees who responded to the BBC's annual staff survey said that if they experienced or saw bullying or harassment that they would be confident that taking action would result in a "fair outcome".
And just over half - 51% - felt BBC policies and procedures would not be applied "fairly and effectively" in cases of bullying and harassment. 
Despite the Jimmy Savile'abuse scandal, almost half of staff are not aware of the corporation's policies to protect those wanting to alert managent.
Only 55% said that the knew that the BBC's "whistleblowing" policy is available if they have concerns about any malpractice or wrongdoing at the corporation.
A leaked copy of a draft of Dame Janet Smith's report into Savile's misconduct at the BBC said a widespread fear of whistleblowing among staff allowed Savile to get away with abuse "in virtually every corner" of the broadcaster's premises.
"I found that employee witnesses who were about to say something to the review that was even mildly critical of the BBC were extremely anxious to maintain their anonymity," Smith wrote. "These people were, and still are, afraid for their positions. Even with modern employment protection, people fear that, even if they do not lose their jobs, their promotion prospects will be blighted if they complain."
A BBC spokesman said said that the corporation's whistleblowing policy was "highly ranked" compared to other public sector organisations.
"Whistleblowing is a challenge for all organisations, not just for the BBC," said a BBC spokesman. "While our scores around bullying, harassment and whistleblowing have improved compared to 2014, we are not complacent and work is continuing to further improve. That includes training for all new managers, a large amount of staff support including counselling, a dedicated bullying and harassment support line, and mediation. Our whistleblowing policy includes a number of ways staff can raise any concerns, and it was found to be highly ranked when compared to other public sector organisations in an independent review last year by the GoodCorporation."
The staff survey also found that in general morale was low, with the majority of respondents losing faith in senior management, which is in the process of finding Â£700m in cuts. 
Just 43% said that they had confidence in the decisions being made by the BBC executive team and their divisional leadership team.
And only a little over half (55%) believed that their colleagues behave respectfully toward each other, regardless of seniority.
"In common with organisations of a similar size, the BBC conducts annual all staff surveys to understand the issues that matter to our employees," said Valerie Hughes-D'Aeth, the BBC's director of human resources. 
"We're pleased that 93% of staff are proud to work at the BBC - an increase on the last year - and that our scores in many areas are significantly higher when compared to other organisations."
Only 46% of staff felt that their line manager "addresses poor performance effectively".
Staff also felt disillusioned about pay - just 40% beleived they were "fairly rewarded" - and just 38% believed the BBC has a fair and open process for filling internal vacancies.
Workload is also an issue for many staff, with 46% feeling it was not "usually achievable" during normal working hours.
Staff were also sceptical about plans to make the corporation's output more appealing to a younger, tech-savvy generation, which includes next month's move to shut the BBC3 TV channel and make it an online-only service.
Only 51% of staff said they thought that the BBC is "doing the right things to ensure that we transform our offer for younger audiences".
The BBC said that 54% of staff completed the annual survey.
Bectu supervisory official Helen Ryan pointed out that the result that showed just 43% had confidence in the decisions being made by the BBC executive team and their divisional leadership team is below the UK average of 55%.
She said the lack of trust in executive decisions was concerning, "especially as there is a new team" as was the result that, 60% of staff do not believe they are fairly rewarded and that "people still don't believe there is an open and transparent filling of internal vacancies."
Ryan said there is a "sense of frustration" that "people fill in the survey, which costs the BBC a lot of money" but "feel their concerns are not being addressed."

 Oil has come back from its worst levels of the day, on renewed hopes that Opec and other producers such as Russia would act to stem the supply glut which has hit prices. 
Brent crude is now down 0.8% at $31.52 a barrel having fallen to $30.83 earlier. But US inventory figures due later will undoubtedly have an impact on the price, not to mention the Federal Reserve rate setting meeting and any effect the US central bank's comments have on the dollar.
Meanwhile the recovery in crude has helped support stock markets. Both the FTSE 100 and Germany's Dax are marginally in positive territory after earlier falls, while France's Cac is only narrowly down.
US futures are showing a 57 point decline on the Dow Jones Industrial Average after Tuesday's 282 point surge.

 Ben van Beurden is upbeat about today's vote, despite the small revolt.
Shell's CEO says:
"I am delighted with the positive shareholder vote and the confidence that shareholders have shown in the strategic logic of the combination of Shell and BG. 
Our immediate focus is on the successful completion of the transaction and we now await the results of tomorrow's BG shareholder vote.
Assuming BG's shareholders approve the deal ( they will ), Shell will become the world's biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) trader.
block-time published-time 12.53pm GMT 
 It's worth reiterating that 17% of Shell shareholders opposed the BG merger at today's vote. 
That suggests that some big City investors have reservations about the deal, despite Shell chief Ben van Beurden's best efforts to persuade them of its merits.

 Standard Life  was the only large investor to go public - their head of equities, David Cumming, reckoned the deal only made sense when oil was over $60 per barrel, not ish$30.
But Standard Life  owned less than 2% of the company, so others have clearly found the deal too risky.
Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, reminds me that even Royal Bank of Scotland's disastrous merger with ABN Amro in October 2007 got the support of 99% of shareholders (who then suffered huge losses). So a 17% revolt may sting, a little.

 Shell shareholders approve BG deal  
 Newsflash from The Hague - Royal Dutch Shell shareholders have just voted in favour of its Â£35bn merger with rival oil firm BG. 
That's despite pressure from some shareholders to renegotiate the tie-up, which was negotiated before the oil price slumped to just $30 per barrel.
During the meeting, Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden told the meeting that the deal would be a "springboard to simplify Shell" , the Evening Standard reports.
Van Beurden also argued that a merger still made sense despite the cheaper oil price.
 The deal was approved by 83% of shareholders, with 17% opposing the plan. 
BG investors give their verdict tomorrow, but there's little chance that they will block the deal.

So argues Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at City firm IG.
He told clients:
RBS's ability to surprise investors with fresh bad news has been one of the hardy perennials of the past six years, and yet still the news keeps coming. George Osborne's decision to sell a chunk of the government's stake last August, which was derided at the time, now looks like a sound financial decision, but it does mean any further sales are essentially off the table.
Coincidentally, with Lloyds down 2% this morning in sympathy, it seems the government will remain a key asset manager when it comes to UK banks.

 RBS CEO promises 'clean-up' after Â£2.5bn profits hit  
If you're just tuning in, here's Jill Treanor's news story about the latest problems at RBS:
 RBS takes Â£2.5bn hit to profits as chief executive announces bank 'clean-up' 
Royal Bank of Scotland is set to report its eighth consecutive year of full-year losses after announcing a string of charges for legal bills, compensation and a pension payment.
The bank, which is more than 70%-owned by the taxpayer, said it would take a Â£2.5bn hit to profits in 2015 as a result of a clean-up exercise, driving its share price to a three-year low in Wednesday's early trading. 
RBS shares fell 5% to 246p - below the 330p at which George Osborne sold off the the government's first tranche of shares in August, and less than half the 502p average price at which taxpayers pumped Â£45bn into the bank.
Issuing an unscheduled trading update on Wednesday, Ross McEwan, the chief executive of RBS, said the move was part of a continued clean-up but conceded that that the bank would make another full-year loss for 2015. It has not reported a profit since 2007.

"I am determined to put the issues of the past behind us, and make sure RBS is a stronger, safer bank. We will now continue to move further and faster in 2016 to clean up the bank and improve our core businesses," said McEwan.
"We've always been open about the scale of past issues facing RBS and although there is clearly much more to do, this announcement is a further step towards addressing legacy issues and building a great bank for our customers and delivering long-term value for our shareholders," he added.....

 The latest problems at RBS show that bankers need keeping on a tight leash, argues campaigners for a financial transaction tax. 
David Hillman, spokesperson for the Robin Hood Tax campaign, says: 
"It's groundhog day in the City as RBS announces yet another huge provision for dodgy dealing and fleecing its customers. 
"Try as it might, the banking sector is incapable of shaking off its past sins. The government must take note - now is not the time for it to ease up on financial sector reform."
There are signs that Britain is taking a softer line with the City. An inquiry into banking culture was curiously abandoned at the end of last year, alarming campaigners. And yesterday, Bank of England deputy governor Andrew Bailey was appointed as head of the Financial Conduct Authority - and hand-picked by George Osborne for this crucial job.

 A quick explanation. When RBS says it is setting aside Â£1.5bn to cover "various US residential mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS") litigation claims", it is referring to one of the more noxious elements of the 2007-08 financial crisis.
In the build-up to the crisis, milions of mortgages were sold to US citizens with shaky credit histories, who could not really afford them. Those loans were repackaged by investment banks into new financial products (the RMBSs) and sold onto investors who weren't told how dangerous they might be.
Cue the credit crunch, and the collapse of the subprime market. Mortgage-backed securities plunged in value, as the borrowers behind them failed to meet their payments and handed back the key to their homes.
And the smaller banks, credit unions, insurers and suchlike who had been left holding them when the music stopped ( and the Big Short paid out ) launched waves of legal action against Wall Street.
RBS had a finger in this unsavoury pie though its US subsidiary, Greenwich Capital Markets. In 2013, the SEC accused it of "misleading investors" and cutting corners, by selling loans that didn't meet underwriting guidelines.
block-time updated-timeUpdated at 9.21am GMT
block-time published-time 8.53am GMT 
 Important point: The Â£1.5bn in new US legal charges announced by RBS this morning does not cover any potential settlements with the US Department of Justice, or various US State Attorney General investigations.
Ian Gordon of Investec warns that:
The timing and the cost of resolving those cases remains highly uncertain.
block-time published-time 8.39am GMT 
 City analysts are punting out their opinions now. 
And Sandy Chen of Cenkos Securities isn't too alarmed by RBS's announcement. He argues that the bank is simply cleaning up the mess of previous eras ( or possibly 'previous errors' ).
The new Â£1.5bn provision against US mortgage-backed security costs brings the total bill to Â£3.8bn - "closer to the Â£4-6bn totals that most analysts have had in mind", Chen says.
And the Â£500m payment protection insurance top-up should be one of the last big ones, given the FCA's consultation on a 2018/19 time-bar on PPI claims, Chen adds.
His conclusion:
Bad news - really? More like putting their past in their behind, as Pumba said (in the Lion King).

 The UK government currently owns almost 73% of RBS, and at today's share price I fear we're stuck with it for some time. 
The taxpayer paid around 502p per share when it bailed the stricken bank out in 2008. 
Today, RBS shares are trading at just 250p, so we would take a stonking loss if George Osborne sells another slice of the bank.
Last summer, he sold Â£2.1bn of stock at around 320p - crystallising a Â£1bn loss for the taxpayer. That deal was criticised, but with hindsight the hedge funds who bought the stock are now sitting on a loss themselves.

 Royal Bank of Scotland has stunned the City with a fresh wave of provisions to cover bad behaviour and legal bills.
In an unscheduled announcement, RBS announced a series of new charges. In a nutshell:

The bank is setting aside $2.2 billion, or Â£1.5bn, to cover litigation claims in the US relating to various residential mortgage-backed securities. That's a legacy of the subprime crisis.
It is also setting aside an extra Â£500m to cover Payment Protection Insurance ("PPI") claims. That's the long-running mis-selling scandal in which millions of consumers were sold insurance they didn't need (or even ask for, in some cases).
RBS taking a goodwill impairment charge of Â£498m against its Private Banking business.

 The agenda: Oil, markets, and then the Fed  
 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets the eurozone, and business. 
Two things dominate today -- the turmoil in the stock markets, and the first US Federal Reserve interest rate decision of 2016.
Traders can't take their eye off the oil price, which is lurching around the $30 per dollar mark this week. Brent crude is currently trading around $31.42 per barrel, helped by rumours that Russia and Saudi Arabia might carve up some kind of deal to cut production. It's all a bit flaky, though.
 Michael Hewson  of CMC Markets explains:
The symbiotic relationship between equity markets and oil prices continued yesterday as after a rocky start to trading saw a slide in oil prices below $30 drag equity markets lower, the lack of follow through saw a semblance of stability return and a sharp recovery back above the $30 level on vague chatter that senior OPEC officials were looking to open a dialogue and put together some form of deal with Russia in an effort to put a floor under prices.
 European markets are likely to be calm this morning, as investors await new from America's central bank. 
At 7pm GMT tonight, the Federal Reserve announces its decision on monetary policy. It will surely (surely!) leave interest rates unchanged, having made the first symbolic post-crisis hike last month. 
The Fed's statement will be scrutinised for its view on the global economy, and any signs of 'hikers' remorse', given the turmoil in the markets in recent weeks.

More than half of BBC staff do not think bullying cases will be tackled fairly; 
Survey comes in wake of leaked draft of report into Jimmy Savile's abuse at the corporation, which said employees were afraid to speak out.

Mark Sweney and Tara Conlan.

More than half of BBC staff do not believe that cases of bullying or harassment would be tackled fairly by the corporation's management.
Just 47% of employees who responded to the BBC's annual staff survey said that if they experienced or saw bullying or harassment that they would be confident that taking action would result in a "fair outcome".
And just over half - 51% - felt BBC policies and procedures would not be applied "fairly and effectively" in cases of bullying and harassment. 
Despite the Jimmy Savile'abuse scandal, almost half of staff are not aware of the corporation's policies to protect those wanting to alert managent.
Only 55% said that the knew that the BBC's "whistleblowing" policy is available of they have concerns about any malpractice or wrongdoing at the corporation.
A leaked copy of a draft of Dame Janet Smith's report into Savile's misconduct at the BBC said a widespread fear of whistleblowing among staff allowed Savile to get away with abuse "in virtually every corner" of the broadcaster's premises.
"I found that employee witnesses who were about to say something to the review that was even mildly critical of the BBC were extremely anxious to maintain their anonymity," Smith wrote. "These people were, and still are, afraid for their positions. Even with modern employment protection, people fear that, even if they do not lose their jobs, their promotion prospects will be blighted if they complain."
The staff survey also found that in general morale was low, with the majority of respondents losing faith in senior management, which is in the process of finding Â£700m in cuts. 
Just 43% said that they had confidence in the decisions being made by the BBC executive team and their divisional leadership team.
And only a little over half (55%) believed that their colleagues behave respectfully toward each other, regardless of seniority.
"In common with organisations of a similar size, the BBC conducts annual all staff surveys to understand the issues that matter to our employees," said Valerie Hughes-D'Aeth, the BBC's director of human resources. 
"We're pleased that 93% of staff are proud to work at the BBC - an increase on the last year - and that our scores in many areas are significantly higher when compared to other organisations."
Only 46% of staff felt that their line manager "addresses poor performance effectively".
Staff also felt disillusioned about pay - just 40% beleived they were "fairly rewarded" - and just 38% believed the BBC has a fair and open process for filling internal vacancies.
Workload is also an issue for many staff, with 46% feeling it was not "usually achievable" during normal working hours.
Staff were also sceptical about plans to make the corporation's output more appealing to a younger, tech-savvy generation, which includes next month's move to shut the BBC3 TV channel and make it an online-only service.
Only 51% of staff said they thought that the BBC is "doing the right things to ensure that we transform our offer for younger audiences".
The BBC said that 54% of staff completed the annual survey.
Bectu supervisory official Helen Ryan pointed out that the result that showed just 43% had confidence in the decisions being made by the BBC executive team and their divisional leadership team is below the UK average of 55%.
She said the lack of trust in executive decisions was concerning, "especially as there is a new team" as was the result that, 60% of staff do not believe they are fairly rewarded and that "people still don't believe there is an open and transparent filling of internal vacancies."
Ryan said there is a "sense of frustration" that "people fill in the survey, which costs the BBC a lot of money" but "feel their concerns are not being addressed."

 Ben van Beurden is upbeat about today's vote, despite the small revolt.
Shell's CEO says:
"I am delighted with the positive shareholder vote and the confidence that shareholders have shown in the strategic logic of the combination of Shell and BG. 
Our immediate focus is on the successful completion of the transaction and we now await the results of tomorrow's BG shareholder vote.
Assuming BG's shareholders approve the deal ( they will ), Shell will become the world's biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) trader. 
block-time published-time 12.53pm GMT 
 It's worth reiterating that 17% of Shell shareholders opposed the BG merger at today's vote. 
That suggests that some big City investors have reservations about the deal, despite Shell chief Ben van Beurden's best efforts to persuade them of its merits.

 Standard Life  was the only large investor to go public - their head of equities, David Cumming, reckoned the deal only made sense when oil was over $60 per barrel, not ish$30.
But Standard Life  owned less than 2% of the company, so others have clearly found the deal too risky.
Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, reminds me that even Royal Bank of Scotland's disastrous merger with ABN Amro in October 2007 got the support of 99% of shareholders (who then suffered huge losses). So a 17% revolt may sting, a little.

 Newsflash from The Hague - Royal Dutch Shell shareholders have just voted in favour of its Â£35bn merger with rival oil firm BG. 
That's despite pressure from some shareholders to renegotiate the tie-up, which was negotiated before the oil price slumped to just $30 per barrel.
During the meeting, Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden told the meeting that the deal would be a "springboard to simply Shell", and still made sense despite the cheaper oil price. 
 The deal was approved by 83% of shareholders, with 17% opposing the plan. 
BG investors give their verdict tomorrow, but there's little chance that they will block the deal.

 The British public had better face the truth - we'll all be shareholders in the banks for a while longer yet. 
So argues Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at City firm IG.
He told clients:
RBS's ability to surprise investors with fresh bad news has been one of the hardy perennials of the past six years, and yet still the news keeps coming. George Osborne's decision to sell a chunk of the government's stake last August, which was derided at the time, now looks like a sound financial decision, but it does mean any further sales are essentially off the table.
Coincidentally, with Lloyds down 2% this morning in sympathy, it seems the government will remain a key asset manager when it comes to UK banks.

 RBS CEO promises 'clean-up' after Â£2.5bn profits hit  
If you're just tuning in, here's Jill Treanor's news story about the latest problems at RBS:
 RBS takes Â£2.5bn hit to profits as chief executive announces bank 'clean-up' 
Royal Bank of Scotland is set to report its eighth consecutive year of full-year losses after announcing a string of charges for legal bills, compensation and a pension payment.
The bank, which is more than 70%-owned by the taxpayer, said it would take a Â£2.5bn hit to profits in 2015 as a result of a clean-up exercise, driving its share price to a three-year low in Wednesday's early trading. 
RBS shares fell 5% to 246p - below the 330p at which George Osborne sold off the the government's first tranche of shares in August, and less than half the 502p average price at which taxpayers pumped Â£45bn into the bank.
Issuing an unscheduled trading update on Wednesday, Ross McEwan, the chief executive of RBS, said the move was part of a continued clean-up but conceded that that the bank would make another full-year loss for 2015. It has not reported a profit since 2007.

"I am determined to put the issues of the past behind us, and make sure RBS is a stronger, safer bank. We will now continue to move further and faster in 2016 to clean up the bank and improve our core businesses," said McEwan.
"We've always been open about the scale of past issues facing RBS and although there is clearly much more to do, this announcement is a further step towards addressing legacy issues and building a great bank for our customers and delivering long-term value for our shareholders," he added.....

 The latest problems at RBS show that bankers need keeping on a tight leash, argues campaigners for a financial transaction tax. 
David Hillman, spokesperson for the Robin Hood Tax campaign, says: 
"It's groundhog day in the City as RBS announces yet another huge provision for dodgy dealing and fleecing its customers. 
"Try as it might, the banking sector is incapable of shaking off its past sins. The government must take note - now is not the time for it to ease up on financial sector reform."
There are signs that Britain is taking a softer line with the City. An inquiry into banking culture was curiously abandoned at the end of last year, alarming campaigners. And yesterday, Bank of England deputy governor Andrew Bailey was appointed as head of the Financial Conduct Authority - and hand-picked by George Osborne for this crucial job.

 A quick explanation. When RBS says it is setting aside Â£1.5bn to cover "various US residential mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS") litigation claims", it is referring to one of the more noxious elements of the 2007-08 financial crisis.
In the build-up to the crisis, milions of mortgages were sold to US citizens with shaky credit histories, who could not really afford them. Those loans were repackaged by investment banks into new financial products (the RMBSs) and sold onto investors who weren't told how dangerous they might be.
Cue the credit crunch, and the collapse of the subprime market. Mortgage-backed securities plunged in value, as the borrowers behind them failed to meet their payments and handed back the key to their homes.
And the smaller banks, credit unions, insurers and suchlike who had been left holding them when the music stopped ( and the Big Short paid out ) launched waves of legal action against Wall Street.
RBS had a finger in this unsavoury pie though its US subsidiary, Greenwich Capital Markets. In 2013, the SEC accused it of "misleading investors" and cutting corners, by selling loans that didn't meet underwriting guidelines.
block-time updated-timeUpdated at 9.21am GMT
block-time published-time 8.53am GMT 
 Important point: The Â£1.5bn in new US legal charges announced by RBS this morning does not cover any potential settlements with the US Department of Justice, or various US State Attorney General investigations.
Ian Gordon of Investec warns that:
The timing and the cost of resolving those cases remains highly uncertain.
block-time published-time 8.39am GMT 
 City analysts are punting out their opinions now. 
And Sandy Chen of Cenkos Securities isn't too alarmed by RBS's announcement. He argues that the bank is simply cleaning up the mess of previous eras ( or possibly 'previous errors' ).
The new Â£1.5bn provision against US mortgage-backed security costs brings the total bill to Â£3.8bn - "closer to the Â£4-6bn totals that most analysts have had in mind", Chen says.
And the Â£500m payment protection insurance top-up should be one of the last big ones, given the FCA's consultation on a 2018/19 time-bar on PPI claims, Chen adds.
His conclusion:
Bad news - really? More like putting their past in their behind, as Pumba said (in the Lion King).

 The UK government currently owns almost 73% of RBS, and at today's share price I fear we're stuck with it for some time. 
The taxpayer paid around 502p per share when it bailed the stricken bank out in 2008. 
Today, RBS shares are trading at just 250p, so we would take a stonking loss if George Osborne sells another slice of the bank.
Last summer, he sold Â£2.1bn of stock at around 320p - crystallising a Â£1bn loss for the taxpayer. That deal was criticised, but with hindsight the hedge funds who bought the stock are now sitting on a loss themselves.

And only a little over half (55%) believed that their colleagues behave respectfully toward each other, regardless of seniority.
"In common with organisations of a similar size, the BBC conducts annual all staff surveys to understand the issues that matter to our employees," said Valerie Hughes-D'Aeth, the BBC's director of human resources. 
"We're pleased that 93% of staff are proud to work at the BBC - an increase on the last year - and that our scores in many areas are significantly higher when compared to other organisations."
Only 46% of staff felt that their line manager "addresses poor performance effectively".
Staff also felt disillusioned about pay - just 40% beleived they were "fairly rewarded" - and just 38% believed the BBC has a fair and open process for filling internal vacancies.
Workload is also an issue for many staff, with 46% feeling it was not "usually achievable" during normal working hours.
Staff were also sceptical about plans to make the corporation's output more appealing to a younger, tech-savvy generation, which includes next month's move to shut the BBC3 TV channel and make it an online-only service.
Only 51% of staff said they thought that the BBC is "doing the right things to ensure that we transform our offer for younger audiences".
The BBC said that 54% of staff completed the annual survey.

Elvis Costello: 10 of the best; 
He emerged in 1977 as the archetype of the angry young man, but it didn't take Elvis Costello long to realise he needed to slow down and try something different.

Jeremy Allen.

1. Less Than Zero
That Declan MacManus had been renamed Elvis Costello in the year that Elvis Presley died was merely a stroke of luck. When news filtered through that the King had died, a period of anxiety gripped the offices of the normally publicity savvy Stiff Records, though they needn't have worried; the seemingly disrespectful timing only added to the withering persona of the new upstart and agitator they were looking to promote. Whether apocryphal or not, the tale that NME were planning on running an Elvis vs Elvis: which one is a Stiff artist? editorial before good taste prevailed makes a good story. MacManus had spent considerable time honing his act with weekly shows at the Half Moon pub in Putney for 50p and a plate of sandwiches in the mid-70s, so by the time Stiff picked him up, he was able to emerge more or less fully formed into the public's consciousness, a man as erudite as he was angry.  
His first single, Less Than Zero, was fittingly vituperative, spitting venom at the British fascist leader Oswald Mosley, accusing him of engaging in incest to boot ("the song was more of a slandering fantasy than a reasoned argument," said the author). Mosley had apparently been the subject of a then recent TV documentary in which he reminisced misty-eyed about the Blackshirts. Whether American novelist Bret Easton Ellis had a grip on 1930s British politics or not, he named his first book after the song, and also his last novel to date - the sequel - pluralising Costello's Imperial Bedroom. Less Than Zero the single is madly catchy and slightly unhinged, and simplistic enough that it fitted in with the burgeoning DIY punk movement; more musically accomplished offerings, like the 1940s-inspired Wave a White Flag, were quietly forgotten about.

2. Radio Radio
Perhaps owing more to luck than judgment, Costello assembled one of the finest bands of the late 70s and early 80s in the Attractions, who appeared for the first time on his magnificent, Clash-mimicking first hit single, Watching the Detectives. By the time recording for the album This Year's Model came around, they were knocking off mod-stomping classics like Pump it Up and (I Don't Want to Go to) Chelsea in one afternoon with Nick Lowe in the control booth. Another muscular anthem rescued from Elvis's days in the virtually unheard of pre-punk band Flip City, Radio Radio, was updated in order to bite the hand that fed him. "And the radio is in the hands of such a lot of fools," he spat, "tryin' to anaesthetise the way you feel." With a sharp hook, a thumping rhythm and Steve Nieve's trademark swirly organ, the band were able to perform the song on Top of the Pops and sing the words right at presenter Tony Blackburn. The song caused further controversy in the US, when Elvis and the Attractions appeared on Saturday Night Live. Halfway through Less Than Zero the band suddenly stopped and played the prohibited Radio Radio instead. Elvis was banned for life from the show, a banishment that lasted all of 12 years.

3. Oliver's Army
Having grown up a Beatles fanatic, Costello would have been honoured and presumably ecstatic when in 1987 the call came from Paul McCartney to write with him. Perhaps Costello could have imparted some tricks to McCartney, like how to write a protest song, especially regarding British colonialism and the Irish question. Musical genius he might be, but McCartney's Give Ireland Back to the Irish was one of the limpest musical protests in the history of song, whereas Oliver's Army was so smart and subversive that many were unaware it was a protest song at all. They just heard the earworm on the radio, joined in with the singalong chorus and lapped up Steve Nieve's sparkling piano part, which owes a huge debt to Abba's Dancing Queen, and then they went out and bought it in large numbers. According to Graeme Thomson's Costello biography, Complicated Shadows, the band had no greater expectation for the song than for it to appear as a B-side when they premiered it at the Roskilde festival in Denmark in 1978. The following year, though, it reached No 2 in the charts, only kept off the top by the Bee Gees and then by Gloria Gaynor. The line "one more widow, one less white nigger" caused little controversy at the time, though when Costello dropped the N-bomb into an argument with Stephen Stills and Bonnie Bramlett at a Holiday Inn in Ohio in March 1979 - he provoked the row, and described Ray Charles as "a blind, ignorant nigger" - it had a disastrous effect on his US popularity. Allegedly high on amphetamines and booze and out to shock, Costello refused to apologise in a press conference for his remarks (his defence at the time was a curt "I'm not a racist", and he had indeed played Rock Against Racism gigs), but he has been contrite on plenty of occasions since, a transgression presumably high up in his list of regrets.

4. Man Out of Time
Whether it was the Holiday Inn incident or just the natural process of growing up, Costello slowly unwound as the 80s gathered pace. He still unleashed unbridled scorn now and again - on Margaret Thatcher on 1989's Tramp the Dirt Down and on Attractions bassist Bruce Thomas on 1991's  How to Be Dumb - but he also appeared to become more reflective and less confrontational. The phrase "angry young man" uses all three components for good reason, and by the time Costello came to record Imperial Bedroom with Beatles engineer Geoff Emerick in London in 1982, he was approaching 28 years old. "At the time of Imperial Bedroom, I came to terms with the fact that I was sacrificing the power of certain songs to this mad pursuit of tempo," he later reflected. "Everything had to be delivered forcefully. I don't know whether it was just a natural process or, literally, cumulative exhaustion of what were very intense years. Man Out of Time is the one time I said, 'No, stop. Let's play this at the right tempo.'" Bookended by an earlier noisier version, the song in between seemingly floats on some Dylanesque Highway 61-era Wurlitzer organ, carried along by a noirish narrative about a cabinet minister hiding out from a sex scandal. It also features the amusing rhyming couplet: "H's got a mind like a sewer and a heart like a fridge / He stands to be insulted and he pays for the privilege." Imperial Bedroom is for good or bad a record of maturity, with Man Out of Time the centrepiece around which everything falls. Costello sometimes overreaches, trying to accommodate too much in a song, but not here, somehow. (And when he does, well you can't fault him for his ambition.) 

5. Shipbuilding
Another protest song, this time about the Falklands war, Shipbuilding made the connection between a thriving shipyard - a source of working-class pride - and the fact fathers were sending their sons to war and to their deaths. Gritty, humane and deeply moving, Shipbuilding rates as one of Costello's best lyrics, a fact not lost on the singer himself, who declared it so on several occasions. The music was written by Clive Langer with Robert Wyatt in mind, with the latter recording released on Rough Trade in 1982. Langer also produced Costello's version when they worked together on the patchy Punch the Clock album in 1983, the song proving to be the highlight. Costello's version gets the nod over the Wyatt version thanks to the stunning, mournful Chet Baker trumpet solo. "Chet Baker, this wizened corpse on death's door, strung out, just played," said Bruce Thomas later. "He followed this bass line and played his solo, so simple, with so much soul in it. It really touched me." 

6. I Want You
Artists with a certain desperation are often the ones that impress Costello the most, from Springsteen and Van Morrison to Jeff Buckley, whom he picked to perform at the Queen Elizabeth Hall when curator of Meltdown in 1995 (it was to be Buckley's last UK performance). Perhaps Costello's most risque and desperate (on many levels) song is I Want You, a creeping first-person narrative that takes us through a fetid, all-consuming obsession. Sung to the object of the piece, it begins with what sounds like a lullaby, before quickly turning nasty, with the verses scratched out over some dampened chords while the voice barely conceals the anger of belonging to an unwelcome suitor. Each verse becomes a little more desperate, a little more deranged, while each line begins with the words "I want you", an emphatic refrain that becomes more and more awkward each time he utters it. "It's knowing that he knows you now after only guessing," he sings, horrifying and horrified. "It's the thought of him undressing you or you undressing." The lyrics and music together are intimately intense, like someone breathing down your own neck, making you shudder, but the melody is irresistible too.

7. Veronica
If Costello was the master of smuggling dark subject matter into the charts without most people knowing what he was actually singing about (which actually annoyed him immensely), then 1989's Veronica might well be the first top 40 hit that broached the difficult subject matter of Alzheimer's. "She'd talk about who knows what and the next minute it'd be 40 years later," says Costello, singing on a chair in a now vacant bedroom at the beginning of the video, "so you'd just sit there and bounce around the years with her." The Veronica in question was his own grandmother Mabel (Veronica was her middle name), and one of his finest, most immediate choruses, becomes a heartbreaker when you scratch a little deeper. Paul McCartney has a songwriting credit on the song, and also contributed Hofner bass (the Attractions had been jettisoned for a revolving door of musicians, as well as frequent contributors such as T-Bone Burnett). The working relationship between McCartney and Costello proved fruitful, and included one album, Flowers in the Dirt, though owing to creative differences related to production, Costello was apparently unhappy with the finished product, and his contribution was eventually somewhat diminished when the record finally surfaced. 

8. The Other Side of Summer
In 1991 Costello recorded Mighty Like a Rose - which became known as the "beard album", on account of the fact he grew a beard, which would have been unthinkable in the clean-shaven punk years. Costello, a former computer operator (for Elizabeth Arden in Acton, before he hit the big time), discovered the practical merits of working with computer software whilst writing Mighty Like a Rose, which may explain why so much of the album is cluttered with melodies and yet more countermelodies. On the opening track, The Other Side of Summer, it works though; the song is a sarcastic Brian Wilson pastiche, a spectacular takedown of all things LA, with Costello in biting mood. "From the foaming breakers of the poisonous surf," he sings cheerfully, "to the burning forests in the hills of Astroturf." There's an environmental undercurrent too, and at the conclusion he warns: "Goodnight, God bless, and kiss goodbye to the earth." Many of the lyrics on Mighty Like a Rose reflect apocalyptic concerns, with Hurry Down Doomsday (The Bugs Are Taking Over) coming across as just plain paranoid. Because of the clutter, the double tracking and maybe the beard, the words aren't always the easiest to decipher, though whether meanings were conveyed or not, The Other Side of Summer is a nailed-down fantastic tune that belongs in the canon. 

9. London's Brilliant Parade
Stick around for long enough in rock'n'roll and proclamations of comebacks are all but inevitable. Costello's supposed dalliances with classical music with the Brodsky Quartet, and the album Now Ain't the Time for Your Tears penned for Wendy James over a weekend with then partner Cait O'Riordan, had for many detracted from his main body of work. So when he was heard to be back in the studio with Nick Lowe and members of the erstwhile Attractions it was all too much for some. The reviews for Brutal Youth were positive, the "reunion" somewhat overegged, overshadowing what might be Costello's finest work. Still Too Soon to Know, 13 Steps Lead Down, Kinder Murder, This is Hell, Sulky Girl, You Tripped at Every Step ... every one is a classic. London's Brilliant Parade gets the nod because it's a beautifully nostalgic love letter to a city that once was, with little trace of Costello's normally world-wearing irony or malice. The lyrics evoke the plot of a beloved old movie too: "She's one of those girls that you just can't place / You feel guilty desiring such an innocent face," sings Costello, "but of course they knew that when they cast her / Along with the red Routemaster." Glorious.

10. When I Was Cruel No 2
2002's When I Was Cruel was supposedly another return to form, or if that wasn't quite true, it at least resembled the Costello brand. Featuring new band the Imposters, the album also marked a new fascination with looping drumbeats, best exemplified on the epic When I Was Cruel No 2. It is an ambient seven-minute exploration that's more trip-hop than anything else; looping ad infinitum with a ghostly woman's voice at the end of each bar that also recalls Gainsbourg and Bardot's Bonnie & Clyde. When I Was Cruel was released on Def Jam, and his curiosity about hip-hop culminated in a collaboration with the Roots in 2013, with mixed results. Most of the choices in this 10 of the best were selected from within the realms of rock, often at its most straightforward, because despite his obvious abilities, acerbic rock'n'roll is what Elvis Costello does best (whether he likes it or not).

Victorian heroines: surprisingly strong-willed, empowered and rebellious; 
Detective fiction, steampunk adventures and historical fantasies - so many Victorian stories have amazing heroines. They're wonderfully rebellious, strong-willed, defiant and adventurous. They're exciting and empowering, and Frances Hardinge says she couldn't have written her gothic murder mystery The Lie Tree without themFind out more about The Lie Tree and why you should review it for Young Critics 2015 here.

Frances Hardinge.

I blame the house. 
Between the ages of seven and 12, I lived in an eerie, grey, mouse-infested hilltop house with a stern-looking stone eagle on the roof. My friends took one look at it, and made comments about "castles". Guests were unnerved by the weird spectral moans the wind made when it blew. No wonder I developed a taste for the old, strange, mysterious and gothic.
My parents let me scramble up and down the huge ladder that scaled their towering bookshelves, and dip into their books as I pleased. I plunged into Victorian novels among others, and quickly took a liking to the darker and more subversive ones. I was fascinated by gothic tales, melodramas and detective stories - the books where any respectable-looking door might suddenly open onto a world of mystery, murder, madness and malice. 
 Related:  My inspiration: Jonathan Stroud on Sir Arthur Conan-Doyle
Predictably enough, my favourite Victorian heroines were the ones who showed signs of brains and a spine.
Galloping through my parents' Sherlock Holmes omnibus, I found the short story A Scandal in Bohemia. With delighted disbelief, I watched the great Sherlock Holmes match wits with a cool-headed, cross-dressing adventuress named Irene Adler... and lose. (Holmes's deep admiration for Irene Adler's intelligence made me respect him all the more.)
Another favourite was Marian Halcombe from Wilkie Collins' The Woman in White. Unlike her sweet, girlish and rather wet half-sister Laura Fairlie, Marian is ugly, strong-willed, outspoken, wickedly humorous and brave. She is also smart enough to give the master-criminal Count Fosco a run for his money. And finally there was Jane Eyre, frail and formidable amid a stormscape of dark romance and gothic peril.
Of course, since then I've read a lot of novels set in Victorian times, many of them steampunk adventures and historical fantasies with amazing heroines. They're wonderfully rebellious, strong-willed, defiant and adventurous. Some of them disguise themselves as boys like Irene Adler, but they go much farther than Irene, Marian or Jane ever did. They tote pistols, or use "unladylike" language, or openly rebel, or overturn the very society that wants to cage them in a dull, submissive life.
I love these stories, and I'm very glad they exist. They're exciting and empowering. The heroines say what I like to think I would have said, and do what I like to think I would have done, if I had been surrounded by Victorian prejudices and conventions.

Only of course I would have done nothing of the sort. 
Looking back now, it seems obvious to us that woman and girls had brains, and that they should have allowed the same education, career opportunities and voting rights as men and boys. At the time, however, it wasn't clear to everybody. People believe what they're brought up to believe, particularly if everybody around them also believes it. They call it "common sense" and never question it.
As a woman, rebelling would have been very hard indeed. You would need a will like a Sherman tank. It's hard to have faith in your own opinions, when everybody you respect believes something else. And even people who do believe in themselves can get worn down if they're faced by endless snubs, rejection, ridicule and obstacles. Defying all the silly social rules might seem like fun if you're only faced by a tutting maiden aunt or a red-faced fuming guardian. But what if scandal might break your parents' hearts or destroy your sister's chances of a good marriage? And what if everyone tells you that disobeying your parents or your husband is going against God?
That is why I'm still fond of Irene Adler, Marian Halcombe and Jane Eyre, even after all these years. They were written back when most people did think that women had weaker minds and characters. The authors who invented them were taking risks, and challenging the common ideas about women. These were characters that broke rules and changed minds.
When I decided to write The Lie Tree, a gothic murder mystery set in the Victorian period, I decided to make my 14-year-old heroine Faith an intelligent girl with an unusual upbringing. She has had the run of her father's library, and even dares to dream of becoming a scientist like her father.
At every turn, however, she sees this dream crushed, and even her beloved father will not take her ambitions seriously. She is unhappy, frustrated, angry... and eventually rebellious. I didn't want to make rebellion look easy, however. That would have been unfair to all those real women who actually had to struggle with prejudice back in those times. I wanted Faith to be a relatively believable Victorian girl, tied in knots by the conflict between her own instincts and everything she has been taught. She is a tangle of self-doubt, loyalty, guilt, frustration, and smothered rage.
During the course of the book, Faith will erupt from her role as "good girl" and dutiful daughter. She will have no choice. But it will not be easy. For anyone.
You might not want to be standing next to her when she does.

 A wave of 'challenger banks' have sprung up since the financial crisis, hoping to win business from scandal-splattered big players such as Royal Bank of Scotland. 
And one of them, Metro Bank, has announced plans to float on the stock market. Metro, which is losing around Â£10m per quarter, wants to raise Â£500m from shareholders.

 The British public had better face the truth - we'll all be shareholders in the banks for a while longer yet. 
So argues Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at City firm IG.
He told clients:
RBS's ability to surprise investors with fresh bad news has been one of the hardy perennials of the past six years, and yet still the news keeps coming. George Osborne's decision to sell a chunk of the government's stake last August, which was derided at the time, now looks like a sound financial decision, but it does mean any further sales are essentially off the table.
Coincidentally, with Lloyds down 2% this morning in sympathy, it seems the government will remain a key asset manager when it comes to UK banks.

 RBS CEO promises 'clean-up' after Â£2.5bn profits hit  
If you're just tuning in, here's Jill Treanor's news story about the latest problems at RBS:
 RBS takes Â£2.5bn hit to profits as chief executive announces bank 'clean-up' 
Royal Bank of Scotland is set to report its eighth consecutive year of full-year losses after announcing a string of charges for legal bills, compensation and a pension payment.
The bank, which is more than 70%-owned by the taxpayer, said it would take a Â£2.5bn hit to profits in 2015 as a result of a clean-up exercise, driving its share price to a three-year low in Wednesday's early trading. 
RBS shares fell 5% to 246p - below the 330p at which George Osborne sold off the the government's first tranche of shares in August, and less than half the 502p average price at which taxpayers pumped Â£45bn into the bank.
Issuing an unscheduled trading update on Wednesday, Ross McEwan, the chief executive of RBS, said the move was part of a continued clean-up but conceded that that the bank would make another full-year loss for 2015. It has not reported a profit since 2007.

"I am determined to put the issues of the past behind us, and make sure RBS is a stronger, safer bank. We will now continue to move further and faster in 2016 to clean up the bank and improve our core businesses," said McEwan.
"We've always been open about the scale of past issues facing RBS and although there is clearly much more to do, this announcement is a further step towards addressing legacy issues and building a great bank for our customers and delivering long-term value for our shareholders," he added.....

 The latest problems at RBS show that bankers need keeping on a tight leash, argues campaigners for a financial transaction tax. 
David Hillman, spokesperson for the Robin Hood Tax campaign, says: 
"It's groundhog day in the City as RBS announces yet another huge provision for dodgy dealing and fleecing its customers. 
"Try as it might, the banking sector is incapable of shaking off its past sins. The government must take note - now is not the time for it to ease up on financial sector reform."
There are signs that Britain is taking a softer line with the City. An inquiry into banking culture was curiously abandoned at the end of last year, alarming campaigners. And yesterday, Bank of England deputy governor Andrew Bailey was appointed as head of the Financial Conduct Authority - and hand-picked by George Osborne for this crucial job.

 A quick explanation. When RBS says it is setting aside Â£1.5bn to cover "various US residential mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS") litigation claims", it is referring to one of the more noxious elements of the 2007-08 financial crisis.
In the build-up to the crisis, milions of mortgages were sold to US citizens with shaky credit histories, who could not really afford them. Those loans were repackaged by investment banks into new financial products (the RMBSs) and sold onto investors who weren't told how dangerous they might be.
Cue the credit crunch, and the collapse of the subprime market. Mortgage-backed securities plunged in value, as the borrowers behind them failed to meet their payments and handed back the key to their homes.
And the smaller banks, credit unions, insurers and suchlike who had been left holding them when the music stopped ( and the Big Short paid out ) launched waves of legal action against Wall Street.
RBS had a finger in this unsavoury pie though its US subsidiary, Greenwich Capital Markets. In 2013, the SEC accused it of "misleading investors" and cutting corners, by selling loans that didn't meet underwriting guidelines.
block-time updated-timeUpdated at 9.21am GMT
block-time published-time 8.53am GMT 
 Important point: The Â£1.5bn in new US legal charges announced by RBS this morning does not cover any potential settlements with the US Department of Justice, or various US State Attorney General investigations.
Ian Gordon of Investec warns that:
The timing and the cost of resolving those cases remains highly uncertain.
block-time published-time 8.39am GMT 
 City analysts are punting out their opinions now. 
And Sandy Chen of Cenkos Securities isn't too alarmed by RBS's announcement. He argues that the bank is simply cleaning up the mess of previous eras ( or possibly 'previous errors' ).
The new Â£1.5bn provision against US mortgage-backed security costs brings the total bill to Â£3.8bn - "closer to the Â£4-6bn totals that most analysts have had in mind", Chen says.
And the Â£500m payment protection insurance top-up should be one of the last big ones, given the FCA's consultation on a 2018/19 time-bar on PPI claims, Chen adds.
His conclusion:
Bad news - really? More like putting their past in their behind, as Pumba said (in the Lion King).

 The UK government currently owns almost 73% of RBS, and at today's share price I fear we're stuck with it for some time. 
The taxpayer paid around 502p per share when it bailed the stricken bank out in 2008. 
Today, RBS shares are trading at just 250p, so we would take a stonking loss if George Osborne sells another slice of the bank.
Last summer, he sold Â£2.1bn of stock at around 320p - crystallising a Â£1bn loss for the taxpayer. That deal was criticised, but with hindsight the hedge funds who bought the stock are now sitting on a loss themselves.

That makes RBS is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100.
Bad news for shareholders - which in RBS's case is every member of the UK public, as we bailed the bank out in 2008.

 The agenda: Oil, markets, and then the Fed  
 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets the eurozone, and business. 
Two things dominate today -- the turmoil in the stock markets, and the first US Federal Reserve interest rate decision of 2016.
Traders can't take their eye off the oil price, which is lurching around the $30 per dollar mark this week. Brent crude is currently trading around $31.42 per barrel, helped by rumours that Russia and Saudi Arabia might carve up some kind of deal to cut production. It's all a bit flaky, though.
 Michael Hewson  of CMC Markets explains:
The symbiotic relationship between equity markets and oil prices continued yesterday as after a rocky start to trading saw a slide in oil prices below $30 drag equity markets lower, the lack of follow through saw a semblance of stability return and a sharp recovery back above the $30 level on vague chatter that senior OPEC officials were looking to open a dialogue and put together some form of deal with Russia in an effort to put a floor under prices.
 European markets are likely to be calm this morning, as investors await new from America's central bank. 
At 7pm GMT tonight, the Federal Reserve announces its decision on monetary policy. It will surely (surely!) leave interest rates unchanged, having made the first symbolic post-crisis hike last month. 
The Fed's statement will be scrutinised for its view on the global economy, and any signs of 'hikers' remorse', given the turmoil in the markets in recent weeks.

 The British public had better face the truth - we'll all be shareholders in the banks for a while longer yet. 
So argues Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at City firm IG.
He told clients:
RBS's ability to surprise investors with fresh bad news has been one of the hardy perennials of the past six years, and yet still the news keeps coming. George Osborne's decision to sell a chunk of the government's stake last August, which was derided at the time, now looks like a sound financial decision, but it does mean any further sales are essentially off the table.
Coincidentally, with Lloyds down 2% this morning in sympathy, it seems the government will remain a key asset manager when it comes to UK banks.

 RBS CEO promises 'clean-up' after Â£2.5bn profits hit  
If you're just tuning in, here's Jill Treanor's news story about the latest problems at RBS:
 RBS takes Â£2.5bn hit to profits as chief executive announces bank 'clean-up' 
Royal Bank of Scotland is set to report its eighth consecutive year of full-year losses after announcing a string of charges for legal bills, compensation and a pension payment.
The bank, which is more than 70%-owned by the taxpayer, said it would take a Â£2.5bn hit to profits in 2015 as a result of a clean-up exercise, driving its share price to a three-year low in Wednesday's early trading. 
RBS shares fell 5% to 246p - below the 330p at which George Osborne sold off the the government's first tranche of shares in August, and less than half the 502p average price at which taxpayers pumped Â£45bn into the bank.
Issuing an unscheduled trading update on Wednesday, Ross McEwan, the chief executive of RBS, said the move was part of a continued clean-up but conceded that that the bank would make another full-year loss for 2015. It has not reported a profit since 2007.

"I am determined to put the issues of the past behind us, and make sure RBS is a stronger, safer bank. We will now continue to move further and faster in 2016 to clean up the bank and improve our core businesses," said McEwan.
"We've always been open about the scale of past issues facing RBS and although there is clearly much more to do, this announcement is a further step towards addressing legacy issues and building a great bank for our customers and delivering long-term value for our shareholders," he added.....

 The latest problems at RBS show that bankers need keeping on a tight leash, argues campaigners for a financial transaction tax. 
David Hillman, spokesperson for the Robin Hood Tax campaign, says: 
"It's groundhog day in the City as RBS announces yet another huge provision for dodgy dealing and fleecing its customers. 
"Try as it might, the banking sector is incapable of shaking off its past sins. The government must take note - now is not the time for it to ease up on financial sector reform."
There are signs that Britain is taking a softer line with the City. An inquiry into banking culture was curiously abandoned at the end of last year, alarming campaigners. And yesterday, Bank of England deputy governor Andrew Bailey was appointed as head of the Financial Conduct Authority - and hand-picked by George Osborne for this crucial job.

 A quick explanation. When RBS says it is setting aside Â£1.5bn to cover "various US residential mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS") litigation claims", it is referring to one of the more noxious elements of the 2007-08 financial crisis.
In the build-up to the crisis, milions of mortgages were sold to US citizens with shaky credit histories, who could not really afford them. Those loans were repackaged by investment banks into new financial products (the RMBSs) and sold onto investors who weren't told how dangerous they might be.
Cue the credit crunch, and the collapse of the subprime market. Mortgage-backed securities plunged in value, as the borrowers behind them failed to meet their payments and handed back the key to their homes.
And the smaller banks, credit unions, insurers and suchlike who had been left holding them when the music stopped ( and the Big Short paid out ) launched waves of legal action against Wall Street.
RBS had a finger in this unsavoury pie though its US subsidiary, Greenwich Capital Markets. In 2013, the SEC accused it of "misleading investors" and cutting corners, by selling loans that didn't meet underwriting guidelines.
block-time updated-timeUpdated at 9.21am GMT
block-time published-time 8.53am GMT 
 Important point: The Â£1.5bn in new US legal charges announced by RBS this morning does not cover any potential settlements with the US Department of Justice, or various US State Attorney General investigations.
Ian Gordon of Investec warns that:
The timing and the cost of resolving those cases remains highly uncertain.
block-time published-time 8.39am GMT 
 City analysts are punting out their opinions now. 
And Sandy Chen of Cenkos Securities isn't too alarmed by RBS's announcement. He argues that the bank is simply cleaning up the mess of previous eras ( or possibly 'previous errors' ).
The new Â£1.5bn provision against US mortgage-backed security costs brings the total bill to Â£3.8bn - "closer to the Â£4-6bn totals that most analysts have had in mind", Chen says.
And the Â£500m payment protection insurance top-up should be one of the last big ones, given the FCA's consultation on a 2018/19 time-bar on PPI claims, Chen adds.
His conclusion:
Bad news - really? More like putting their past in their behind, as Pumba said (in the Lion King).

 The UK government currently owns almost 73% of RBS, and at today's share price I fear we're stuck with it for some time. 
The taxpayer paid around 502p per share when it bailed the stricken bank out in 2008. 
Today, RBS shares are trading at just 250p, so we would take a stonking loss if George Osborne sells another slice of the bank.
Last summer, he sold Â£2.1bn of stock at around 320p - crystallising a Â£1bn loss for the taxpayer. That deal was criticised, but with hindsight the hedge funds who bought the stock are now sitting on a loss themselves.

January 27, 2016 Wednesday 10:05 AM GMT 

The most potent, permanent and elusive figure in British politics; 
His enemies call him the 'PM's puppet-master'. Blair, Brown and Cameron all found him invaluable. He's been at the heart of the most controversial political episodes of recent times. Just who is Jeremy Heywood?.

Andy Beckett.

It is easy to miss the Cabinet Office on Whitehall in central London. To the uninitiated, it is just another bone-coloured, net-curtained facade in the unreadable heartland of British government. Seemingly the only noteworthy thing about the building is that its Victorian bulk stands directly between 10 Downing Street and the outside world. Most visitors to the prime minister have to get past the Cabinet Office first.
Since 2012, the head of this department, the cabinet secretary, has been Sir Jeremy Heywood. In the historian Peter Hennessy 's book Whitehall, one of few successful attempts to explain Britain's labyrinthine and unusually dominant central government, the Cabinet Office, set up exactly a hundred years ago, is described as the "coordinating brain for the whole system". 
Since well before 2012, Heywood has been the most powerful person in Britain that most people have never heard of. "He is the person who is always in the room with the prime minister, the person who is always there on the conference call," says a former head of the Downing Street Policy Unit (even Heywood's former colleagues usually prefer to talk about him off the record). He was economic and domestic policy secretary to prime minister Tony Blair from 1997 to 1998, and his principal private secretary from 1999 to 2003; head of domestic policy for prime minister Gordon Brown from 2007 to 2008; and Downing Street permanent secretary, first for Brown and then for David Cameron, from 2008 to 2011.
Through two temperamentally opposed Labour administrations, the turbulent Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, and into the current, dominant-but-brittle Tory government, Heywood has been a uniquely influential constant in Downing Street: a fixer and an enforcer, a confidant and a coordinator, a peacemaker and a crisis manager, an assessor of policies, an interpreter of protocol, a relentless accumulator of responsibilities and contacts and institutional knowledge, a conductor of internal inquiries, a keeper of secrets. A former Downing Street chief of staff says: "Jeremy's like a drug. People get addicted to him quite quickly. Prime ministers are not sure about him at first. Then they say, 'Umm, that's rather good. I need that.'"
Jeremy's like a drug. People get addicted to him quite quickly
His one absence from Downing Street was a senior job at the American bank Morgan Stanley between 2003 and 2007. And even that was interrupted by cravings for Heywood from No 10. As soon as Brown became prime minister in 2007, one of his closest allies says: "One of our priorities was to get Jeremy back from the City."
Heywood has been so central to British government for so long that few of its most contentious modern episodes have not involved him: the Iraq war and its aftermath; the hasty formation of the coalition; the Conservatives' encouragement of Rupert Murdoch's abortive bid for BSkyB ; the News of the World phone-hacking scandal and Cameron's employment of its former editor  Andy Coulson ; the alleged gagging of ministers over airport expansion and the EU referendum ; the row over British plans to restrict benefits for EU migrants ; the Plebgate affair that ruined the government chief whip Andrew Mitchell; the government's refusal to release official papers on the treatment of trade unionists and other Tory foes during the 1970s and 1980s; the attempted silencing of the National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden.
Confirmed Heywood interventions are rare. In June 2013, he visited this newspaper and warned its then editor, Alan Rusbridger, that the Guardian's involvement with Snowden could make it a target for "our guys" in British intelligence and "Chinese agents on your staff". In September 2014, just before the Scottish independence referendum, the Queen made a carefully loaded public statement which bent the rules of royal impartiality to the advantage of the no campaign. "I hope people will think very carefully about the future", she told a crowd near her Scottish residence at Balmoral. Heywood had co-written it with her private secretary, Sir Christopher Geidt.
Much more often, Heywood's exact contribution to government policies and decisions is the subject of rumour and counter-rumour, of briefings by underlings and allies and enemies. Only his ubiquity and importance are universally agreed on. "He has the ability to be 24/7 in Downing Street but also well-connected to the outside world. He has sources in other government departments," says a former head of the Downing Street Policy Unit. Another former colleague of Heywood's from Downing Street says: "Jeremy would quite often think he could do things better than someone else, that a project would be improved by a bit of Jeremy input."
There is no official manual that sets out what the cabinet secretary is supposed to do. Last year Heywood sketched some of his activities for one of Cameron's biographers, Anthony Seldon. "Every morning, we kick off with a prime minister's meeting. Sometimes we have an afternoon meeting as well ... I help the prime minister to think through what should be on the cabinet agenda. I sit next to the prime minister in cabinet, and take a record of what's been discussed ... [then] making sure that is followed through."
Like almost everything Heywood says in public, the tone was informal, unstuffy, seemingly straightforward. For anyone who learned about cabinet secretaries from Sir Humphrey Appleby, the grand, gleefully manipulative holder of the post in the 1980s television satire Yes, Prime Minister, Heywood can initially appear a disappointment. He is a northerner, as his vowels sometimes show despite over a quarter of a century in Whitehall. He speaks quietly and without drama. In his palatial office, all wood panelling and chandeliers, his desk is small and nondescript and unshowily tucked into a corner. He sometimes receives visitors with his jacket off, and, at 54, still wears his hair in a boyish quiff. In his rimless glasses, with his tirelessly precise sentences, he is more like a senior accountant or a top management consultant than the pinstriped mandarins of civil service legend.
But power in Whitehall has always come in many guises. The more you ponder Heywood's roles as he described them to Seldon - "I help the prime minister to think"; "making sure" cabinet decisions are "followed through" - the larger they seem. "He understands how to make this massive machine move," says Rohan Silva, who was, between 2010 and 2013, a key member of the Downing Street Policy Unit. "He reads everything. He works harder than anyone I've ever worked with. If you CC him on an email, it clears a path through the bureaucracy. But he wears it all very lightly. The PM and the chancellor just think he's great."
Last year, Heywood was also made head of the civil service. Alongside his backstage Downing Street role, he became the public face and boss of an organisation of 390,000 employees, which, in the austerity era, is going through possibly the most brutal job cull in its history. "For many people this [job] would be one of the biggest things they did," Heywood told a recent gathering of senior civil servants and Whitehall-watchers at the Institute for Government. "It is just number five on my list."
Heywood has made enemies. To the conservative magazine the Spectator, he is "the PM's puppet-master", curbing Cameron's more innovative impulses to protect Whitehall's interests; or "'Wormtongue' after Tolkien's poisonous power behind the throne in the Lord of the Rings". To the Daily Mail, he is the "eminence grease", "Whitehall's most cynical mandarin", and "Sir Cover-up", allegedly responsible for undermining the Freedom of Information Act and the Chilcot inquiry into the UK's role in the Iraq war.
In 2011, even before Heywood's most recent promotions, the perceptive rightwing commentator Peter Oborne wrote in the Daily Telegraph that Heywood was "a perfect manifestation of everything that has gone so very wrong with the British civil service over the past 15 years - too cosy a relationship between public and private, too much dominance at the centre, contempt for tradition and the collapse of due process." In 2013, the Times reported that Heywood was becoming "an increasingly controversial figure in Whitehall": "not explicitly disloyal" to ministers with whom he disagreed, but "unhelpful to the government". Heywood had allegedly told a recent meeting of bankers that "his job was being made harder by the differing priorities of senior government figures", as if one of the government's objectives ought to be making his job easier.
Heywood also has critics on the left. To the Labour MP Paul Flynn, he is "a politician who thinks he's a civil servant, and a civil servant who thinks he's a politician"; "slippery" and lacking the civil service's traditional neutrality; "He takes the prime minister's side too quickly." A prominent Tory MP says: "Heywood is regarded with quite a lot of suspicion by MPs. He's not avuncular and reassuring in his style. He's sometimes a little too enthusiastic at finding some contorted way of supporting the government. He's prepared to come before a select committee and say that black is white. That creates a mistrust. People describe him as a courtier."
Heywood's critics tend to be foes of Whitehall. And some of their criticisms of him seem incompatible. Can he be both Cameron's courtier and controller? Too loyal to the government and disloyal? A secret Blairite, as some rightwingers insist, while also the eager servant of Tory governments? Yet politics, especially gossipy high politics, is not always fair or logical; and the fact is that after decades of discreet influence - "I try my best to stay invisible," he said on his first, belated appearance before a select committee in 2012 - Heywood has become a story. And civil servants are not supposed to be. "He's not a bad man," says the Conservative MP David Davis, a frequent adversary. "But he does need to worry that he's become controversial." Heywood has become the personification of Whitehall in an era when Whitehall is shrinking and unpopular. Has he reached the zenith of his influence at precisely the wrong moment?

* * *
                     Heywood was born in the former mill town of Glossop, outside Manchester, in 1961. His mother was an archaeologist and his father was an English teacher at a private Quaker school, Bootham, in York. The Heywoods were not Quakers, but they liked the school's ethos: it encourages pupils to be precociously confident without being loud, to listen carefully to others, and to resolve conflicts without the heavy-handed application of rules. Heywood became head boy. "He was not a dynamic leader, had no great powers of oratory, but he knew absolutely everything that was going on in school," says Michael Allen, who taught him history and cricket. "He had quite a good relationship with the school rogues. He was a friend of everyone."
Heywood applied to Oxford University to study history and economics. "He came back from [his] interview and said he'd mucked it up," Allen recalls. "The dons had asked him about statistics, which he'd only just started studying. Shortly after the interview, the dons sought me out and said, 'You've got such a clever young man here. We just wanted to keep him off his familiar ground.'" They gave Heywood a scholarship.
His chosen Oxford college, Hertford, was one of the university's less grandiose, known for its leftwing politics and unusual number of students from state schools. When he started there in 1980, "it was quite a lively time", remembers a friend and fellow undergraduate. "Thatcher had just been elected. We had friends who were anarchists, post-punks. Jeremy was anti-establishment - or at least very comfortable in the company of lefties. He was a chainsmoker. He pogoed at parties and discos. He went with the anarchists on an overland trip to Pakistan."
But Heywood is a good compartmentaliser. In 1983 he left Oxford with a first and a place in the fast stream of the civil service. It was then a familiar thing for an ambitious graduate to do: the civil service workforce had hit an all-time peak of 750,000 only six years earlier, and although the Thatcher government was steadily reducing it, there were more than one-and-a-half times as many civil servants as there are now.
After a year as an economist at a relatively new and marginal department, the Health and Safety Executive - for critics of Heywood and Whitehall, a byword for maddening caution and bureaucracy - he moved quickly to one of the civil service's traditional centres of power: the Treasury. Because it controls the money, writes Hennessy, "The Treasury has a window into every ministry." In 1984, when Heywood joined, the Treasury was particularly potent, with a self-confident new chancellor, Nigel Lawson, and the British economy finally beginning to boom again after the recessions of the 1970s and early 80s.
Heywood was one of many sharp youngsters in the department. He soon became known for expertly combining technical tasks with more politically delicate work. "I first met Jeremy at the Treasury in 86 or 87," says the economist Jonathan Portes, who remains a close friend. "He was working as private secretary to [the Treasury minister] Norman Lamont." Lamont had received a letter from a famous showbiz Tory complaining about their tax bill. Portes had drafted a dismissive reply. "Jeremy thought it was too brusque," he says. "And Jeremy won."
Another former Treasury colleague remembers: "Jeremy was the most phenomenal private secretary of his generation. Nobody else has the stamina or the bandwidth. He would run his minister's life. Sort out which papers they saw. Link them to their department. It's a job he's gone on doing, for progressively more important people."
In 1990, Lamont became chancellor. The following year, he and the slightly gauche new prime minister, John Major, took part in the fraught Maastricht treaty negotiations that created the modern European Union. At one point, Major recalls in his autobiography, the British delegation mislaid the prime minister's entire bargaining script. "A frantic search took place as I returned to the negotiations without it ... Eventually Jeremy Heywood, Norman Lamont's able private secretary, let out a whoop of delight. He had discovered it among Norman's papers."
Not yet 30, Heywood was already a distinct Whitehall presence: even younger-looking than his years, floppy-haired, skinny verging on gaunt, often speaking in a discreet murmur but intimidatingly confident, still a ferocious smoker. Instead of taking public transport to and from work, he would get lifts with colleagues so he could lean out of the window and keep puffing.
Between 1992 and 1993, David Cameron worked with him, as Lamont's special adviser. According to Cameron's recent biographers Michael Ashcroft and Isabel Oakeshott, the future prime minister was "in awe" of Heywood. They quote the veteran Tory journalist and Cameron-watcher Bruce Anderson: "People thought [Heywood] lived off coffee and cigarettes. He'd get stopped at airports because he looked like a druggy. [Cameron] thought he was ... the cleverest guy he'd ever met."

In 1992, the Treasury's status and self-esteem were suddenly punctured when Britain was forced to withdraw from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), a precursor to the euro. Lamont was sacked as chancellor soon afterwards. But Heywood, less directly associated with the ERM policy, survived, first as private secretary for the new chancellor, Ken Clarke, and then in an even more senior and sensitive Treasury role. In 1994, with the government cutting public spending to pay for the ERM fiasco, - a shrinking of the state that would become almost as severe and prolonged as the current one -  Heywood was asked to lead a "fundamental review" of the ministry's running costs.
He did it with gusto. While the Treasury had been telling other departments to tighten their belts for decades, its own operations, in Heywood's view, were too unfocused and hierarchical. His report recommended that the Treasury be given "concrete objectives", such as "delivering permanently low inflation" and "maintaining sound public finances"; that some of its work be handed to "other government departments or the private sector"; and most provocatively of all, that it cut its "senior management posts" by "around 30%".
Many of Heywood's colleagues were aghast. "I know of no one here," an anonymous senior official told the Guardian at the time, "who would dissent from the view that morale is the worst in living memory." The part of the Treasury where the threatened mandarins worked became known as "the corridor of death". But many of Heywood's recommendations were enacted, including the job cuts. He felt that he had made an important contribution to the modernisation of British government. He stayed at the unsettled Treasury for another three years. "Jeremy has a chip of ice in him," says a friend.

* * *
                     What Heywood actually believes is the subject of debate among even his closest colleagues and friends. All agree that, unlike many civil servants, he lacks a party-political side, even in the most private social contexts. "He's the most non-political person I've ever met," says a former Downing Street colleague. "It's like he had an operation and someone removed the political bit." Heywood does vote, but only he, and possibly his family, know who for.
Yet, occasionally, off-duty, he lets off steam. An old friend who goes out for dinner with him intermittently says: "He talks about what's been happening at work that day. To the extent that he gets angry, it's always been because individuals have been behaving badly... or incompetence... or something conspicuously wasteful." The latter is a longstanding Heywood preoccupation. Someone who worked closely with him for years under Blair says: "He can't stand waste. He has a pretty laser-like focus on efficiency and rationality. He's like one of those time and motion men from the 60s: you can imagine him going round with a clipboard." In the otherwise bland articles and blogs he writes as head of the civil service, about improving working practices and meeting diversity targets, Heywood sometimes describes himself as "a data man".
In public, he often uses the language of business to explain the work of government: the civil service is "a net exporter of ideas" to foreign bureaucracies; "ministers are customers for our advice"; official reports are "product". "Jeremy is an expression of the management culture that has gradually taken over Whitehall since the 80s," says a former Brown adviser. "It's a free-market conception of statecraft." Or you could see it as a way of justifying the continued existence of government in an anti-government age.
"You can't just have grand old Whitehall figures in leather armchairs making promises and policy statements, as you could in the old days," says Jonathan Powell, Blair's former chief of staff, who joined the civil service in 1979. "Modern politicians of all parties are desperate for [tangible] things to change on the ground." It is a climate that suits Heywood. Powell says: "Jeremy is impatient - an attribute of people who get things done."
Former and current colleagues say that over the decades Heywood has acquired his own policy preoccupations - deregulating the economy, improving British competitiveness, updating the welfare system - and that he prefers working for reforming governments. Richard Reeves, director of strategy for the deputy prime minister Nick Clegg during the coalition's first two years, says: "Heywood does well under radicals, of the left or the right. He's a very long way from Sir Humphrey. He wants to use the power of government to change things."
At the same time, Heywood also believes in order and continuity. In public, he likes to distil the messy, overflowing business of government to pithy lists of achievements and tasks, of official structures and procedures. He talks about crises being "managed down". He regards much of the media as overexcitable: "There's a lot of rhetoric in the newspapers," he told the public administration committee in 2012, "but the business of government goes on." He speaks quickly but smoothly, with so few hesitations and such a command of detail that it is easy to picture ministers and prime ministers - tired or inexperienced, perhaps, or distracted by party-political matters - listening a little passively, and then doing whatever "Jeremy" suggests.
In 1997, when Labour returned to office after an 18-year absence, Tony Blair quickly summoned Heywood from the Treasury. The two men spoke for a few minutes at No 10, while Blair sat on a sofa and ate an apple. Then the new prime minister hired Heywood as his economic and domestic policy secretary. Despite spending his career so far working for Conservative governments, Heywood was now one of the new premier's most senior advisers. Or at least, he was in theory. The ambitious Blair government was full of advisers jostling for influence, and in the maze of Downing Street Heywood was given a desk in a different room from Powell, Blair's key lieutenant. Heywood refused to settle for it; instead, he manoeuvred his way into sharing Powell's office. Blair's inner circle were impressed.
They were also impressed by Heywood's working style. Polite and unmacho in meetings - useful qualities in a government with too many alpha males - he could be cutting in other contexts. "I would hear him on the phone with Treasury people," says someone who was with him in Blair's Downing Street. "They're so incredibly rude to each other. They have an offensive, not defensive, negotiating style. Jeremy's very dry, very ascetic, very precise - not like Tony or Gordon at all."
Blair quickly came to rely on Heywood as a troubleshooter. In 2000, when anti-tax protests at fuel depots began to starve the country of petrol, Powell wrote later, "in desperation" the government "got the operational heads of all the major oil companies and the police ... to come into the Cabinet Office, and installed them in a small, chilly office ... Jeremy Heywood and I moved in there with them, and we kept them working day and night." After a week, the protests petered out.
But Heywood's most valued troubleshooting was internal. With relations increasingly sour between Blair and Brown, go-betweens were required to hold the government together. The chancellor's emissary was his combative economic adviser, Ed Balls, and initially the prime minister was represented by Powell. But by 1999 Powell had had enough, and Heywood took over the role. He had reservations about Brown. "I remember coming out of a meeting at Chequers in 1998 at which Gordon had been particularly difficult," says a former Labour spin doctor, "and Jeremy said to me, 'That man will make a terrible PM!'" But Heywood mostly kept such thoughts to himself, and from his Treasury days he understood the power of a chancellor. The Brownites, in turn, respected Heywood for his Treasury work; had Blair not done so first, the chancellor would have hired him.
For several years, Heywood and Balls met almost daily - often three times daily. Most of the unadvertised meetings took place at the Treasury. But every Tuesday morning, from 8.30 to 9.30, they met on more neutral territory, at Cafe Churchill on Whitehall. The Italian greasy spoon (now gone) sold overpriced, watery cappuccino, but was only yards from both Downing Street and the Treasury, and its interior, only dimly visible from the street, was small enough to deter eavesdroppers.
"Jeremy has this gift for managing to find a way through acrimonious, seemingly impossible situations, picking out what matters most to people, and managing to persuade everyone that they've won," says Portes. Balls came to trust Heywood: first, as a reliable guide to Blair's thinking; then, increasingly, as a government player in his own right. As Seldon put it in his 2007 book Blair Unbound: "Balls had no respect for Blair as an economist or a thinker, and assumed that he merely took his script from Heywood." A politician who has worked closely with Heywood says: "To be very good at being a private secretary or cabinet secretary, you have to be very close to the boundary between civil service work and politics, but not step over it. He is very good at that."
Yet even Heywood's appetite for Whitehall intrigue is not infinite. During the early 2000s he began to talk to colleagues about taking a sabbatical. One motivation was personal. In 1994, while compiling his unsparing report on the Treasury, he had met and worked with Suzanne Cook, a civil servant who was even more organised than he was. They married in 1997, and in 2002 they had their first child.
The following year, Heywood's plan to take some time off with his new son turned into something larger: he left Downing Street and the civil service, and joined Morgan Stanley, which went on to hire a succession of senior Labour figures including Powell and Blair himself. The hours were shorter, the pay was much better, and after 20 years in Whitehall, Heywood wanted a new environment. His only other break had been a brief secondment in the late 1980s to the British delegation at the International Monetary Fund in Washington DC, a traditional initiation for Treasury high-fliers into the realities of Britain's place in the world.
At Morgan Stanley, Heywood adjusted to other realities, taking banking exams and acquiring the transatlantic lift to the end of his sentences which often marks out members of the modern British elite. Based in London as an adviser on mergers and acquisitions, and then as co-head of Morgan Stanley's UK investment banking division, he was excited by the City's constant hunger for innovations. But he found making money for himself and others less fulfilling than helping run the country. In 2007, after only four years, Brown, now prime minister, persuaded him to come back to Whitehall.
Brown's young government was struggling. It had hastily called off a general election and was unpopular, divided, derided by the press and a resurgent Conservative opposition. "The No 10 operation was in a total tailspin," says a Downing Street veteran of the time. Brown was hiding away in his office, working too hard, and hiring too many advisers; power was chaotically scattered through Downing Street.
"Heywood brought a kind of order," says the veteran. Heywood helped persuade Brown and his key staff to work in the same room, and took a desk right next to the prime minister. Heywood processed Brown's incessant demands calmly. Heywood delegated. "If you come to a meeting with Jeremy," says the veteran, "you'll go away with something to do."
Even Heywood's banking experience and contacts proved useful. By leaving the City, he had narrowly avoided direct association with the 2007-8 financial crisis, and instead became a valued part of the government's efforts to help resolve it, chairing meetings all over Whitehall in the run-up to the G20 summit about the crisis in London in 2009. During the gathering, he told Seldon with rare feeling: "We had a wonderful dinner ... Just leaders. No 10 is beautiful on those sorts of evenings. Very intimate. You just sort of see the power in the room, and you just know you're involved around the edges ... of historic moments."
The Brown government stabilised enough to stop the Conservatives winning the 2010 election outright. And the hung parliament presented Heywood with yet more opportunities to be useful and influential. In the Labour peer Andrew Adonis's well-informed account of the formation of the coalition, 5 Days In May, Heywood appears "in hushed phone conversation at his desk" for most the period, "often with the Queen's private secretary" about the constitutional complexities of the situation. But once the Tory-Lib Dem coalition crystallised, Heywood was quick to ready himself for his new masters. In the famous photographs of the final moments of the Brown administration, he is wearing a blue tie.

* * *
                     After the intensity of Brown, the workaholic Heywood took a while to get used to Cameron's more relaxed approach to being prime minister. "I vividly remember a budget meeting out at Chequers," says a former coalition adviser. "We were discussing something important, like tax credits, and Cameron tried to bring the conversation to a close, because he wanted lunch. The look on Heywood's face! You could see the jolt of surprise."
The adviser continues: "There was less of an intellectual fit between Heywood and Cameron's people than there had been between him and the Blairites and Brownites. But Cameron came to rely on him. You could  see the relief with which he delegated to him." The inexperienced Tory-Lib Dem coalition also needed his deal-making. During 2011 and 2012, when the parties fell out over whether employment rights should be drastically reduced, in order to (in theory) revive the economy, Heywood suggested a compromise that such rights should only be weakened at startup companies. "No one else had thought of it," says one of those involved in the discussions. "It was a moment of pure Heywood."
With his reforming mindset, and his Treasury background, Heywood got on well with the restless new chancellor, George Osborne. But Cameron's director of strategy, Steve Hilton, was an outspoken critic of Whitehall: he wanted the government to shrink the number of civil servants by three-quarters. At first, Heywood was surprisingly friendly towards his rival. According to Matthew D'Ancona's history of the coalition, In It Together, "Heywood claimed to agree with much of what [Hilton] stood for and urged him to persist." Heywood was keen on efficiency, after all. But when Hilton tried to turn his ideas into government policy, Heywood abruptly withdrew his support: telling MPs that Hilton's plan to gut the civil service, for example, was not "remotely" the government's approach. Cameron and the Downing Street machine ultimately sided with Heywood: "They liked smooth surfaces and courteous negotiation rather than the deliberate disruption that Hilton favoured," writes D'Ancona. In 2012 it was announced that Hilton was leaving the government for a university post in America. Shortly afterwards, Heywood was asked by the public administration committee about his Downing Street relationship with Hilton. The cabinet secretary swept a hand across the committee table, fingers outstretched, palm outward. "Steve has now left for California," he said. "As far as I'm aware."
Heywood doesn't enjoy appearing before such committees. He sees the cabinet secretary's job as essentially private - to be an intimate of the powerful and advise them frankly - and therefore not a very useful object of public scrutiny. But the committees summon him increasingly often, anyway, and question him more and more impatiently, sometimes with open exasperation. His relentlessly level voice, his transatlantic mannerisms, his liking for jargon - "It's on my dashboard," he will say, deflatingly, of a potentially juicy controversy - all this can make him seem like a member of the Whitehall establishment, minus the traditional charm; a reined-in and unshowy mandarin for unforgiving times.
"His body language is defensive," says Flynn, who is on the public administration committee. "He hasn't built a rapport with us." In an era of small or nonexistent Westminster majorities, nosy, troublemaking MPs such as Flynn and Davis are increasingly common. Belatedly perhaps, they have woken up to Heywood's importance. Or they have settled for grilling him as a way of getting at the slippery Cameron. "Part of the role of cabinet secretary," says a former Heywood colleague, "is to be the PM's human shield."
Heywood dislikes media attention even more than select committees. He hates being called "Sir Cover-up" by the Daily Mail. Given all his speeches and committee appearances, given the profusion of online official material about the Cabinet Office's activities, - which have expanded in recent years, to include everything from the controversial new system of electoral registration to making government procurement more efficient - Heywood considers himself the most transparent cabinet secretary ever.
There is evidence to the contrary. Last September, he said that the Freedom of Information Act had had "some chilling effects" on the operation of government. The publication of the Chilcot report has undeniably been delayed by long negotiations between the inquiry and Heywood about the release of correspondence between Blair and President George W Bush. But it is too simple, and too convenient for the many people in Whitehall, past and present, with things to hide, to see Heywood's actions in these areas as wholly his own. All cabinet secretaries are sometimes ordered to play Sir Cover-up.
Where Heywood stands out, perhaps, is the stubbornness and ingenuity with which he defends the freedom of action of governments, and of prime ministers in particular. Rather than codes of conduct or fixed Whitehall structures, he murmurs to the select committees, he favours "precedent", "discretion", "responsiveness". This is the traditional clever bodging of British central government. A degree of instability in politics also puts a premium on civil servants, like Heywood, who can offer the opposite.
With the exception of the magazine Civil Service World, Heywood almost never gives on-the-record interviews to reporters, and declined to do so for this article. The more he says in public, he believes, the more journalists will speculate about him, the more manipulations they will attribute to him. But it is almost certainly too late for such reticence: newspaper sketchwriters already converge on his every committee appearance.
The government's spending cuts, too, are making his life more challenging. State employees he meets on official trips around the country as head of the civil service are sometimes scathing to him about their workplace burdens and conditions. "I'm sure that he's worried," says one of his oldest friends. "I don't think he has a view about whether the cuts are the right thing to do, per se, but if they make the civil service less effective, that would be the opposite of what he has devoted his career to."
By the next general election, Heywood will be approaching 60. He has three children, and they will all still be teenagers. He is closely involved with them, when his Downing Street duties permit: his list of recreations in Who's Who reads, "childcare, modern art, cinema, Manchester United". His wife Suzanne is now a partner at the management consultants McKinsey. She earns a lot more than his Â£195,000 salary, which is high but not exceptional for a top civil servant - the ultra-competitive Heywood has been known to complain about the disparity - and she is younger. It is possible to imagine him retiring to their large house in south London, with its walk-in wine cellar and the numerous other extensions they have added, which look onto the deep garden. The Heywoods are holders of good, politically eclectic parties.
Portes insists that his friend Jeremy is "still in love with his work. He has this gift for juggling 16 things at once, for keeping it all in his head". A former close colleague of Heywood says: "There have always been a few people like him in the civil service: very, very big brain capacities, good interlocutors, always in the key meetings - activist civil servants. They always have their supporters, and their detractors. In the 70s, [the head of the civil service] Sir William Armstrong was called 'the deputy prime minister'." But Heywood's ex-colleague does not mention that Armstrong left government after a nervous breakdown.
For now, the most permanent, most potent and most elusive unelected figure in British government can be glimpsed at work more easily than you might imagine. From Horseguards Parade behind Whitehall, after darkness falls, the interior of a particularly fine Victorian office is milkily visible through three net-curtained, first-floor windows. A desk light blazes. A shirtsleeved figure, slightly heavier than in his youth, pads comfortably around, deep into the evening. Sir Jeremy Heywood is working late again.

 The latest problems at RBS show that bankers need keeping on a tight leash, argues campaigners for a financial transaction tax. 
David Hillman, spokesperson for the Robin Hood Tax campaign, says: 
"It's groundhog day in the City as RBS announces yet another huge provision for dodgy dealing and fleecing its customers. 
"Try as it might, the banking sector is incapable of shaking off its past sins. The government must take note - now is not the time for it to ease up on financial sector reform."
There are signs that Britain is taking a softer line with the City. An inquiry into banking culture was curiously abandoned at the end of last year, alarming campaigners. And yesterday, Bank of England deputy governor Andrew Bailey was appointed as head of the Financial Conduct Authority - and hand-picked by George Osborne for this crucial job.

 A quick explanation. When RBS says it is setting aside Â£1.5bn to cover "various US residential mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS") litigation claims", it is referring to one of the more noxious elements of the 2007-08 financial crisis.
In the build-up to the crisis, milions of mortgages were sold to US citizens with shaky credit histories, who could not really afford them. Those loans were repackaged by investment banks into new financial products (the RMBSs) and sold onto investors who weren't told how dangerous they might be.
Cue the credit crunch, and the collapse of the subprime market. Mortgage-backed securities plunged in value, as the borrowers behind them failed to meet their payments and handed back the key to their homes.
And the smaller banks, credit unions, insurers and suchlike who had been left holding them when the music stopped ( and the Big Short paid out ) launched waves of legal action against Wall Street.
RBS had a finger in this unsavoury pie though its US subsidiary, Greenwich Capital Markets. In 2013, the SEC accused it of "misleading investors" and cutting corners, by selling loans that didn't meet underwriting guidelines.

 Important point: The Â£1.5bn in new US legal charges announced by RBS this morning does not cover any potential settlements with the US Department of Justice, or various US State Attorney General investigations.
Ian Gordon of Investec warns that:
The timing and the cost of resolving those cases remains highly uncertain.

 City analysts are punting out their opinions now. 
And Sandy Chen of Cenkos Securities isn't too alarmed by RBS's announcement. He argues that the bank is simply cleaning up the mess of previous eras ( or possibly 'previous errors' ).
The new Â£1.5bn provision against US mortgage-backed security costs brings the total bill to Â£3.8bn - "closer to the Â£4-6bn totals that most analysts have had in mind", Chen says.
And the Â£500m payment protection insurance top-up should be one of the last big ones, given the FCA's consultation on a 2018/19 time-bar on PPI claims, Chen adds.
His conclusion:
Bad news - really? More like putting their past in their behind, as Pumba said (in the Lion King).

 The UK government currently owns almost 73% of RBS, and at today's share price I fear we're stuck with it for some time. 
The taxpayer paid around 502p per share when it bailed the stricken bank out in 2008. 
Today, RBS shares are trading at just 250p, so we would take a stonking loss if George Osborne sells another slice of the bank.
Last summer, he sold Â£2.1bn of stock at around 320p - crystallising a Â£1bn loss for the taxpayer. That deal was criticised, but with hindsight the hedge funds who bought the stock are now sitting on a loss themselves.
enltrAll the people who complained about Osborne selling RBS shares at 330p will of course notice that it dropped back below 250p this morning.

 RBS shares fall 5% after new wave of costs  
 Shares in Royal Bank of Scotland have slumped by 5% at the start of trading, shedding 12.1p to 248p. 
That makes RBS is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100.

 RBS announces Â£2.5bn in new provisions  
 Royal Bank of Scotland has stunned the City with a fresh wave of provisions to cover bad behaviour and legal bills.
In an unscheduled announcement, RBS announced a series of new charges. In a nutshell:

The bank is setting aside $2.2 billion, or Â£1.5bn, to cover litigation claims in the US relating to various residential mortgage-backed securities. That's a legacy of the subprime crisis.
It is also setting aside an extra Â£500m to cover Payment Protection Insurance ("PPI") claims. That's the long-running mis-selling scandal in which millions of consumers were sold insurance they didn't need (or even ask for, in some cases).

 The agenda: Oil, markets, and then the Fed  
 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets the eurozone, and business. 
Two things dominate today -- the turmoil in the stock markets, and the first US Federal Reserve interest rate decision of 2016.
Traders can't take their eye off the oil price, which is lurching around the $30 per dollar mark this week. Brent crude is currently trading around $31.42 per barrel, helped by rumours that Russia and Saudi Arabia might carve up some kind of deal to cut production. It's all a bit flaky, though.
 Michael Hewson  of CMC Markets explains:
The symbiotic relationship between equity markets and oil prices continued yesterday as after a rocky start to trading saw a slide in oil prices below $30 drag equity markets lower, the lack of follow through saw a semblance of stability return and a sharp recovery back above the $30 level on vague chatter that senior OPEC officials were looking to open a dialogue and put together some form of deal with Russia in an effort to put a floor under prices.
 European markets are likely to be calm this morning, as investors await new from America's central bank. 
At 7pm GMT tonight, the Federal Reserve announces its decision on monetary policy. It will surely (surely!) leave interest rates unchanged, having made the first symbolic post-crisis hike last month. 
The Fed's statement will be scrutinised for its view on the global economy, and any signs of 'hikers' remorse', given the turmoil in the markets in recent weeks.

 A quick explanation. When RBS says it is setting aside Â£1.5bn to cover "various US residential mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS") litigation claims", it is referring to one of the more noxious elements of the 2007-08 financial crisis.
In the build-up to the crisis, milions of mortgages were sold to US citizens with shaky credit histories, who could not really afford them. Those loans were repackaged by investment banks into new financial products (the RMBSs) and sold onto investors who weren't told how dangerous they might be.
Cue the credit crunch, and the collapse of the subprime market. Mortgage-backed securities plunged in value, as the borrowers behind them failed to meet their payments and handed back the key to their homes.
And the smaller banks, credit unions, insurers and suchlike who had been left holding them when the music stopped ( and the Big Short paid out ) launched waves of legal action against Wall Street.
RBS had a finger in this unsavoury pie though its US subsidiary, Greenwich Capital Markets. In 2013, the SEC accused it of "misleading investors" and cutting corners, by selling loans that didn't meet underwriting guidelines.

block-time published-time 8.53am GMT 
 Important point: The Â£1.5bn in new US legal charges announced by RBS this morning does not cover any potential settlements with the US Department of Justice, or various US State Attorney General investigations.
Ian Gordon of Investec warns that:
The timing and the cost of resolving those cases remains highly uncertain.
block-time published-time 8.39am GMT 
 City analysts are punting out their opinions now. 
And Sandy Chen of Cenkos Securities isn't too alarmed by RBS's announcement. He argues that the bank is simply cleaning up the mess of previous eras ( or possibly 'previous errors' ).
The new Â£1.5bn provision against US mortgage-backed security costs brings the total bill to Â£3.8bn - "closer to the Â£4-6bn totals that most analysts have had in mind", Chen says.
And the Â£500m payment protection insurance top-up should be one of the last big ones, given the FCA's consultation on a 2018/19 time-bar on PPI claims, Chen adds.
His conclusion:
Bad news - really? More like putting their past in their behind, as Pumba said (in the Lion King).

 The UK government currently owns almost 73% of RBS, and at today's share price I fear we're stuck with it for some time. 
The taxpayer paid around 502p per share when it bailed the stricken bank out in 2008. 
Today, RBS shares are trading at just 250p, so we would take a stonking loss if George Osborne sells another slice of the bank.
Last summer, he sold Â£2.1bn of stock at around 320p - crystallising a Â£1bn loss for the taxpayer. That deal was criticised, but with hindsight the hedge funds who bought the stock are now sitting on a loss themselves.

Australia's 'abusive refugee policies' criticised in damning international report; 
Human Rights Watch report also finds governments across south-east Asia and the Pacific are stifling free speech, imprisoning dissenters and suppressing social media.

Helen Davidson and Ben Doherty.

Australia's failure to meet international standards for protecting asylum seekers had had a devastating human toll and damaged the country's international reputation, according to the Human Rights Watch 2016 World Report.
 Related:  UN accuses Australia of systematically violating torture convention
The report also found governments across south-east Asia and the Pacific have stifled free speech, imprisoned dissenters and suppressed social media over the past year, as human rights abuses remain a major issues in the region Even where some governments, such as Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, had pledged to address abuses, they had largely failed to act on the rhetoric, the report found.
Released in Istanbul on Wednesday, the HRW report argued the global spread of terrorist attacks and large flows of refugees across borders led many governments "to curtail rights in misguided efforts to protect... security".
"These backward steps threaten the rights of all without any demonstrated effectiveness in protecting ordinary people," HRW executive director, Kenneth Roth, wrote. 
At the same time, Roth said, authoritarian governments, fearful of peaceful dissent fanned and magnified by social media, embarked on the most intense crackdown on independent groups in recent times. 

Australia
HRW found Australia had a "solid" record of protecting civil and political rights, robust institutions and a free press, but the government's sustained failure to meet international standards for protecting asylum seekers had had a devastating human toll and damaged Australia's international reputation. 
Australia's policies of mandatory detention, offshore processing and regional resettlement were criticised in 2015 by United Nations experts, foreign governments, Australian government-funded inquiries and the federal parliament.
An independent review of conditions in the Australian-run detention centre in Nauru found evidence that children and adults were sexually and physically assaulted. Thirty-three asylum seekers allege they have been raped or sexually assaulted there, and a parliamentary inquiry found conditions on the island were " not adequate, appropriate or safe ".
 Related:  Australia up for human rights council seat despite UN official's criticism of asylum secrecy
"Despite the international outcry over its refugee policies, Australia did little to redeem its reputation in 2015," said Brad Adams, HRW's Asia director. "Australia needs to seriously rethink its abusive refugee policies and take steps to restore its international standing as a rights-respecting country."
HRW also highlighted the secrecy around Australia's immigration detention regime. Nauru and Manus Island detention centres are both off-limits to journalists and rights groups, and under the Border Force Act, whistleblowers who expose abuse or criminal behaviour face jail terms of up to two years.
The UN special rapporteur on human rights of migrants cancelled a visit to Australia in September out of fear that the people he spoke to could face imprisonment.

Papua New Guinea
Australia's immigration policies were also linked to human rights abuses in Papua New Guinea.
In January 2015, police detained a large group of asylum seekers from the Manus Island detention centre following a hunger strike in January, holding them for several weeks in crowded local police cells.
HRW said the "protracted and indefinite nature" of detention on the island was causing significant mental health problems.
Forty years after gaining independence, Papua New Guinea was found to have made some efforts in addressing human rights abuses, but had stalled when it came to following through, HRW found.
Papua New Guinea remained one of the most dangerous places in the world for women and girls, and efforts by the prime minister to undermine anti-corruption bodies continued.
Domestic violence was specifically outlawed in the 2013 Family Protection Act but the government is yet to implement it and few perpetrators of violence against women face the justice system.
Similarly, sorcery-related violence continued despite the belief that someone was a witch was no longer legally considered a defence for murder.
There also remained a "severe" lack of services for victims seeking treatment, assistance or protection.
Police routinely sought to resolve family violence incidents through mediation or compensation, and often demanded money for "fuel" from victims in return for investigating. The report also found little accountability for police brutality. 

Indonesia
Indonesia faced similar criticisms for its lack of follow-through on human rights pledges. 
HRW said the country had a mixed record in 2015, and accused the government of producing "more rhetoric than reality" as president Joko "Jokowi" Widodo missed opportunities to adopt human rights measures. 
 Related:  Indonesian military insists on virginity tests to determine 'naughty' female recruits
From January to November there were 194 violent attacks on religious minorities, including the demolition of religious sites, according to NGO Setara Institute.
While some West Papuan political prisoners were released by the Indonesian government in May and November, 45 West Papuans and 29 Ambonese independence activists remained in prison for political crimes, the report said.
On Indonesian statute books, there were now more than 320 local discriminatory regulations which target women, after another 31 were passed by national and local governments in 2015.
Among them was a regulation issued by the ministry of defence allowing male employees to take a second wife if their first wife was unable to have children.
And while some Indonesian officials criticised the "abusive, discriminatory and unscientific 'virginity tests'" which the armed forces requires female applicants to undergo, the tests remained in place.
"We need to examine the mentality of these [female] applicants. If they are no longer virgins, if they are naughty, it means their mentality is not good," Indonesian military spokesman Maj Gen Fuad Basya said.
Also noted was Jokowi's embrace of Indonesia's death penalty. Jokowi had run for election on a platform of being tough on crime, particularly drug smugglers. Fourteen people were executed in Indonesia in 2015, after only five since 2009. A moratorium has since been observed, reportedly out of concern for the economic impact of the international condemnation.
 Related:  Jokowi, we voted for a humble man. Now you've taught a new generation about killing | Laksmi Pamuntjak
"The Jokowi government's approach to human rights has been more rhetoric than reality, while serious rights abuses go unpunished," said Phelim Kine, deputy director in HRW's Asia division. "Jokowi can and should take strong actions to advance justice and curtail abuses in 2016."

Singapore
In Singapore, the People's Action party won its 14th straight election in 2015, maintaining its record of having never been out of power since 1959, and for all of the country's independent history. 
Despite its dominance, the PAP continues to fiercely restrict freedom of assembly and speech. 
In March, the government arrested 16-year-old blogger Amos Yee Pang Sang for posting online a video about the death of former Singaporean prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, and a cartoon showing Lee having sex with former British PM Margaret Thatcher. He was imprisoned for 53 days.
Other online bloggers have faced civil and criminal defamation for criticising government policies.
The pro-LGBT Pink Dot festival was held for the seventh consecutive year in Singapore in 2015, however a cinema advertising campaign for the festival was banned by the government, which ruled it was "not in the public interest to allow cinema halls to carry advertising on LGBT issues".
A song by Jolin Tsai, We're All Different, Yet The Same was banned from TV and radio because of its lyrics about homosexuality.

Malaysia
HRW wrote that human rights in Malaysia "plummeted" in 2015, "with increased harassment and persecution of human rights defenders, activists, political opposition figures, and journalists". 
The Sedition Act, which is used to prosecute people who criticise the government and judiciary, was strengthened in 2015 to include jail terms of up to 20 years.
 Related:  Malaysia court dismisses challenge to 'unconstitutional' sedition law
At least 30 people, including seven opposition parliamentarians, have been charged with sedition since 2013.
A series of major demonstrations against government corruption were allowed to take place in Malaysia in 2015, but prominent protestors were arrested after the events. HRW also criticised Malaysia for its continued prosecution of opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim over sodomy charges - a trial widely seen as politically motivated.
"The Malaysian government responded to public criticism of a major corruption scandal and its persecution of former opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim with a wave of repression," HRW's Phil Robertson said. "Prime Minister Najib Razak is trampling on fundamental rights to hush up corruption allegations and maintain his grip on power."

Thailand
Similar crackdowns on citizens occurred in neighbouring Thailand, where the military junta, which has governed with "deepening authoritarianism" since May 2014, repressed human rights "with total impunity" in 2015, HRW said. 
 Related:  Man jailed for 30 years in Thailand for insulting the monarchy on Facebook
The ruling regime - the National Council for Peace and Order led by prime minister general Prayut Chan-ocha - took power in a coup d'Ãtat and promised to restore democracy within a year, but instead "exercised increasingly dictatorial power and continued to systematically repress fundamental rights and freedoms".
Legislation introduced in 2015 extended the NCPO rule, granted further powers to Prayut and absolved anyone who acts on behalf of the NCPO of legal liability, HRW found.
Under the new powers the military can also secretly detain people and interrogate them without charges, trial or access to lawyers. Allegations of abuse and mistreatment were summarily dismissed by the NCPO.
 TV stations were suspended or shut down, and HRW's webpage remains blocked because it is seen as a threat to national security. More than 60 political events were cancelled and the former deputy prime minister's passport was revoked to punish him for criticising military rule.
There were no prosecutions or apparent investigations into extrajudicial killings, nor any progress on the 64 enforced disappearances reported on by HRW.
However the NCPO did prosecute 56 people for the crime of criticising the monarch, with one man sentenced to 60 years - which was later halved - for Facebook posts. Fourteen activists were charged with sedition for criticising the NCPO in June.
The junta also defied international pleas to respect non-refoulement laws and policies, returning to China two Chinese activists and 109 ethnic Uighurs whose whereabouts are now unknown.
The May 2015 discovery of more than 30 bodies at a human trafficking camp near the Malaysian border led to the arrest of a dozens of gangsters, businessmen, community leaders and local politicians, as well as army Lieutenant General Manas Kongpan for trafficking.
"Respect for human rights in Thailand is going down the drain," said Adams.
"The international community urgently needs to press the junta to reverse course, end repression, respect fundamental rights and fulfil its pledges to return to democratic civilian rule."

Perceptions of corruption in Australian government and public sector increase; 
Result puts Australia 13th globally for perceived openness, the country's equal lowest ranking in 20-year history of Transparency International index.

Michael Safi.

Perceptions of corruption in the Australian government and public sector increased in 2015 for the fourth year running, surging six points since 2012 in an annual index by Transparency International. 
A federal anti-corruption agency, muscular anti-foreign bribery laws and political donations reform were required to help arrest the slide, senior members of the anti-corruption group said.
The result put Australia in 13th place globally for perceived openness, the country's equal lowest ranking in the 20-year history of the report.

Comparable democracies such as the UK, the US and New Zealand have held steady or improved their index scores in the past four years.
The annual index, which ranks 168 countries on a scale of 0 (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean), is compiled from 12 surveys of transparency experts and business people.
Australia's 2015 score was 79, down from 80 last year. Denmark came in first with 91, followed by Finland (90), New Zealand (88) and the Netherlands (87). North Korea and Somalia ranked last with eight points each.
Brazil suffered the biggest fall, dropping five index points amid a bribery and money-laundering scandal engulfing its state-owned oil company, Petrobras, that has drawn in some of the country's most senior politicians.
Libya, Spain and Turkey were singled out with Australia as "big decliners", with Greece, Senegal and the UK praised for their progress.
The chair of Transparency International Australia, Anthony Wheatley QC, said Australia's score was "the result of inaction from successive governments who have failed to address weaknesses in Australia's laws and legal processes".

Foreign bribery scandals such as those involving the Australian Wheat Board and Securency had damaged Australia's reputation and legislation introduced into parliament in December was "long overdue", he said.
The group also called for  a federal anti-corruption agency with similar powers to the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption; a nationally consistent and tighter political donations disclosure regime; and safeguards against dirty money from overseas bleeding into the Australian finance or real estate industries.
Wheatley said addressing weaknesses in government would also raise the bar for the private sector.
The Turnbull government "seems to be taking steps that look very encouraging", he said.

Australian support for monarchy has grown as debate for republic revived; 
Things have changed since the 1999 republic referendum, and earlier beliefs of a drop in support for the ancient institution were wrong, research paper says.

Daniel Hurst Political correspondent.

Australians' support for the monarchy has grown steadily since the 1999 republic referendum, showing the "folly" of previous predictions that constitutional change was inevitable, new research suggests. 
A paper published in the Australian Journal of Political Science examines the shift in attitudes between the late 1960s and now, and helps to explain Malcolm Turnbull's reluctance to champion the issue.
It finds that support for the monarchy fell sharply in the 1990s - a period that included "significant" royal scandals, the divorce of Prince Charles and Diana, and the decision by the Labor prime minister Paul Keating to campaign to move towards a republic. 
 Related:  Australian republic: time for 'high-brow worthiness' over, says Peter FitzSimons
After a low point in support for the monarchy at the turn of the century, when voters rejected the form of a republic proposed in the 1999 referendum, the standing of the royals has recovered.
Luke Mansillo, a PhD candidate at the University of Sydney, points to "considerable improvements" in the monarchy's public profile, culminating in Prince William's wedding to Catherine Middleton in 2011, and the births of Prince George in 2013 and Princess Charlotte in 2015.
Mansillo suggests in the paper that "this improved profile and the declining number and frequency of royal scandals improved the Australian public's image of the monarchy". It enabled younger Australians to develop more positive attitudes towards it, and those of older Australians were repaired.
"Previous expectations of continual erosion of support for the ancient institution were folly," he writes. "Monarchy has become more popular in a country that is better educated and less religious." 
The paper draws on data from previous research, including the Australian Election Study, a long-running project to canvass public opinion in each federal election year.
In 1998, 34% believed Australia should "definitely become a republic" and a further 32% believed it should "probably become a republic", a total of 66%. By 2013, definite support for a republic had fallen to 26% and probable support had declined to 27%, a total of 53%.
Over the same period, total support for retaining the Queen increased from 34% to 47%, the Australian Election Study showed.
Mansillo's paper says opinions are influenced by childhood and adolescent political socialisation. People who teenagers when the then governor general John Kerr dismissed Gough Whitlam as prime minister in 1975 have "the most resilient passion against the monarchy" and were "the only cohort to strengthen their anti-monarchist resolve in 2001 following the referendum".
Turnbull and the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, support a republic but they differ on whether now is the time to pave the way for another referendum. 
Turnbull - who led the Australian Republican Movement before the 1999 referendum defeat and accused the then prime minister, John Howard, of "breaking this nation's heart" - played down the prospects for another attempt when he ousted the avowed monarchist Tony Abbott from the Liberal leadership last year. 
On Tuesday he restated his view that the next occasion to consider a referendum would be after the end of the Queen's reign, and said it would succeed only if it was driven by a genuine grassroots movement rather than imposed by politicians.
"To get momentum - and frankly there was more momentum in the late 90s than there is now - it needs to have grassroots support," Turnbull said. 
 Related:  Malcolm Turnbull says republic doomed to 'heroic defeat' unless driven by public
"I have led a 'yes' case for a republic into a heroic defeat once. I have got no desire to do so again. If you really are committed to Australia becoming a republic, then you want to be sure that the manner and the timing of the referendum is such that it is successful and that it unites rather than divides Australians."
Shorten said he understood Turnbull had been "badly bruised" by the failure of the 1999 campaign, but that he needed to "shed the ghosts of the past generation, and indeed Tony Abbott and the right wing of his Liberal party". 
"The stars are aligning for a debate about Australia becoming a republic," Shorten said on Tuesday.
The Australian Republican Movement has sought to build momentum by publishing a pro-republic open letter signed by all premiers and chief ministers, with the exception of Western Australia's Colin Barnett. The newly announced Australian of the Year, David Morrison, has also pledged support for constitutional change.
But the government frontbencher Steven Ciobo said Australians were more focused on issues such as jobs and growth.
"In time I have no doubt, as in fact the prime minister does, that we will see the republic debate come to the forefront in a more meaningful way, but we're not going to jump every single time someone stands up and goes 'Quick, we need a republic today,' " Ciobo told Sky News.
The Labor frontbencher Anthony Albanese accused Turnbull of sacrificing his principles on the republic, climate change and marriage equality because "none of them were as important as getting the keys to the Lodge".

Parents of dead Tory activist criticise party over bullying scandal inquiry; 
Elliott Johnson's parents voice concerns that senior member of board that will consider party's official inquiry has alleged associations with Mark Clarke.

Ben Quinn.

The parents of the 21-year-old Tory activist who is believed to have taken his own life after claiming that he was being bullied have criticised the approach taken by the Conservative party's inquiry into their son's death.
Warning that they were not going to "go away quietly", Elliot Johnson's parents also added to calls for a senior figure on the party board that will consider the Conservatives' report into Johnson's death to step down due to his alleged association with the man at the centre of the scandal. 
 Related:  Elliott Johnson: the young Tory destroyed by the party he loved
"We live out in the backwater so they are probably thinking: 'Well, if we silence them they will go away quietly'," Alison Johnson told BBC Newsnight. "But we definitely won't. We want justice for our son."
Referring to the party's inquiry, she added: "We heard that they wanted to interview my husband and myself individually to find out what our stories were. Well it's not a story, it's the facts. We can only deal with the facts. Elliot has now gone. We can only deal with the facts."
She and her husband, Ray Johnson, also took issue with the continued role of Rob Semple, the chairman of the Conservatives' National Convention, on the party board that will consider the official report into what happened. 
                     The Conservative party board has announced that the law firm Clifford Chance will conduct the investigation "in its entirety". Andrew Feldman, the Conservative chairman, has agreed to distance himself from the investigation, as has Robert Halfon, deputy chairman of the party.
 Related:  The Guardian view on the Mark Clarke scandal | Editorial
Newsnight reported that Semple is regarded by many potential witnesses to the inquiry as having been too close to Mark Clarke, who is at the centre of accusations of bullying and blackmail and who has been expelled from the Tory party for life. 
Elliot's father said that Semple "should do the decent thing" and realise that any inquiry conducted by the Conservative party in which he takes a part is always going to be questioned by the public. 
"People are going to say: 'How can a man who has been associated with Mark Clarke be seen to a person who is overseeing part of the inquiry?'," he said.
Semple said in a statement provided to the BBC that he was not in touch with Clarke, adding that he would ensure the investigation's findings would be honoured in full. 
"I am committed to ensuring that the highest possible standards of behaviour are upheld," he said. "I urge witnesses to come forward so that the full facts are known."
The Tory party said that Semple was not being asked to step down from the board. 
Johnson, a Nottingham University graduate who worked for the campaign group Conservative Way Forward, was found dead on the railway tracks at Sandy station, Bedfordshire, on 15 September 2015. He had made a formal complaint to the party about Clarke before his death. 
Responding to allegations that he bullied Johnson, Clarke has previously told the Guardian : "I strongly refute any suggestion of bullying or harassment. I am not making any further comment about this matter. The family have asked for privacy and I respect both their wishes and the coroner's process.

Laquan McDonald shooting: officer's dashcam mic 'intentionally destroyed'; 
Maintenance records reveal that Chicago police officers have been involved in routine destruction and sabotage of dashboard cameras and microphones.

Jamiles Lartey.

The microphone equipment for the dashboard camera in the cruiser in which Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke was riding on the night he fatally shot 17-year-old Laquan McDonald had been "intentionally destroyed", according to maintenance documents first acquired by DNAinfo.
 Related:  'Nothing happens to the police': forced confessions go unpunished in Chicago 
The records, which include service requests on hundreds of Chicago police vehicles, show that officers have routinely been involved in the intentional destruction and sabotage of body-worn microphones that sync with dashboard camera video.
After the video of the Laquan McDonald shooting was released in November, it was discovered that as much as 80% of the department's dashcam footage was missing audio. This was determined to be due to technical failure, human error or in some cases, according to police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi, "intentional destruction".
William Calloway, a Chicago activist who was instrumental in obtaining the release of the Laquan McDonald footage, said the logs proved a premeditated effort by officers to avoid transparency. 
"They are intentionally sabotaging this audio equipment because in their mind, they're going to do something wrong or reckless when they're outside on the beat," Calloway said. 
He added that he was "absolutely not shocked or surprised about it at all".
The records show that the dashcam in Van Dyke's vehicle, 6412, was repaired on 17 June 2014, about three months after it was reported broken. The next day, the system was reported broken again. What technicians called "intentional damage" was not repaired until 8 October 2014, DNAinfo reported.
On 20 October, the dashcam (and one in another car) recorded Van Dyke's fatal shooting of McDonald. The next month, technicians noted the missing audio in the car's footage and suggested "it is apparent from the uploaded videos that personnel have failed to sync the mics". 
In November 2015, after the video emerged, Van Dyke was charged with homicide. 
At least six other vehicle records show technicians noting that officers had not synced their microphones. Thirty service records show cases where either mics were not synced correctly or had been "intentionally defeated". 
More than 100 records show systems missing microphones, or having damaged systems with missing components such as batteries and antennas.
In an interview, Fraternal Order of Police president Dean Angelo scoffed at the idea that officers were intentionally disabling units. "Operator error could be anything. It could be you didn't turn it on right or you broke the microphone by accident or you lost the mic," Angelo said.
"Do some people then decide to not engage with properly placing the items where they're supposed to be? I'm sure that happens," Angelo added, but said there was no evidence to suggest that could account for a substantial amount of the missing audio. "Things always trickle downhill so it winds up the responsibility of the beat officer - god forbid it's the responsibility of the agency," Angelo added. 
In December, the Chicago Sun-Times reported that before the McDonald video was released, some officers threw their microphones on to a station roof, apparently in protest about having to be recorded. A sergeant who saw the incident reported it to the Independent Police Review Authority.
The Chicago police department owns a long legacy of misconduct that includes torture scandals concerning Commander John Burge and Detective Richard Zuley, and the operation of the Homan Square "black site".
The most recent scandal, over an apparent attempt to cover up the Laquan McDonald shooting, has resulted in a US Department of Justice investigation.

Spotlight review - Catholic church called to account over child abuse; 
Old-style journalism triumphs in the story of the real-life team who knocked on doors and scoured the cuttings library to reveal a scandal that may have begun centuries ago.

Peter Bradshaw.

Star Rating: 4 stars
Spotlight is a movie of clarity and force: the true story of the Boston Globe's "Spotlight" team and its 2002 campaign to investigate a church cover-up of child abuse by Catholic priests. 
Its value was obvious at the Venice film festival last year, but it has grown in my mind since: what seemed like a plodding pace is actually a shrewd approximation of the steady drumbeat that effective reporting creates. This is what the police work of investigative journalism looks like: the documents, the phone calls, the pre-web clippings, the expense of shoe leather in going out to interview people who don't want to be interviewed. Spotlight doesn't have the sensational thrills of Alan J Pakula's All the President's Men (1976), or for that matter David Fincher's Zodiac (2007). And there are a few journo cliches. But it has the sinew of a really good procedural, underpinned by genuine moral outrage. 
Michael Keaton plays veteran reporter Walter "Robby" Robinson, working alongside hot-tempered Mike Rezendes, played by Mark Ruffalo, and Sacha Pfeiffer, played by Rachel McAdams, who has an extraordinary scene when she persuades an abuser-priest to come to the door and talk. Boston was a clubbable world in which a smile on the golf course, or a pat on the back and a meaningful look at the church social was enough to enforce silence. It takes a new editor, Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) - non-Boston, non-Catholic - to shake things up and insist on doing the child abuse story properly, and paradoxically reveal the paper's own former shortcomings. 
The film has real insights to offer: the cast powerfully convey the journalists' horror at realising the abuse stretches back decades or even centuries and also how abuse is as much about power as sex and that homosexuality is beside the point: the abusers have evolved the choice of boy victims because boys are reticent, more likely to swallow their shame and not speak out. A powerful story.

Tory bullying inquiry: official seen as 'witness obstacle' steps down; 
Volunteers' organisation chair Rob Semple steps aside after pressure from parents of Tory activist Elliott Johnson, who took his own life.

Rowena Mason Political correspondent and Jamie Grierson.

A Conservative official has stepped aside from the investigation into the death of Elliott Johnson and the youth wing of the party following pressure from the Tory activist's parents.
Rob Semple, chair of the Tory volunteers' organisation, the National Convention, was on the board which was due to consider a report by the law firm Clifford Chance. However Semple had been named by up to 15 potential witnesses as the reason why they would not give evidence.
The inquiry is to look at events linked to Johnson's reported suicide and to the alleged activities of Mark Clarke, a Tory election aide who ran the Road Trips campaign, transporting young activists around the country. 
Johnson, a Nottingham University graduate and an activist with the rightwing campaign group Conservative Way Forward, was found on railway tracks on 15 September 2015.
Lord Feldman, the Conservatives' chairman, is among those giving evidence to the investigation, which will cover allegations of bullying, sexual misconduct and blackmail involving Clarke, which he had categorically denied.
From the start the inquiry has been dogged by accusations of it not being sufficiently independent from the Conservatives.
BBC's Newsnight reported claims last week that Semple's role was proving a block to the progress of the investigation, which was taken out of the hands of the Tory party and handed to the the law firm before Christmas. It said that up to 15 key witnesses were reluctant to give evidence because of Semple's alleged political links to Clarke in the past.
 Ray Johnson, Elliott's father, said for the first time since his son died the Tory party had given him and his family sight of an announcement in advance of releasing it publicly.
But he said he still does not believe the inquiry will be impartial. "Their [the Conservative party] attempts to control and influence the outcome of the investigation has been obvious to all from the start.
"We are happy that Mr Semple had the good sense to recuse himself, however we are not satisfied that this investigation will be fully impartial - it is, after all, being undertaken by the Conservative party's own solicitors, who would not fully answer the questions asked by our solicitor regarding their contact with individual senior Conservatives.
"We will not be a party to this, nor will we allow ourselves to be interviewed. It is up to individual activists to decide whether they will now allow themselves be interviewed, based on their own judgement on impartiality and personal security.
"The Conservatives within CCHQ have from the beginning acted solely in their own interests and not in the interests of us and its volunteer activists. It is only constant pressure that has moved them towards the correct path.
"They have wriggled like slippery eels to evade scrutiny. We will not stop until we discover why CCHQ failed to act against Mark Clarke in August, when our son made his complaint, or until we discover the identity of those individuals who leaked Elliott's complaint (and those of other activists) back to Clarke." 
On Thursday, Semple released a statement saying he was stepping down after seeing an interview with the Johnsons on the BBC. "As a father myself, the wishes of Mr and Mrs Johnson are paramount to me and after seeing their interview on BBC TV, I have decided to recuse myself from the board meeting that will discuss the Clifford Chance report. 
"As a Conservative volunteer for 20 years I want to establish the truth of what happened to Elliott. I am convinced the investigation will be fair and thorough, and my decision must not be regarded as my accepting any suggestion that I would be less than impartial. As chairman of the voluntary party I will be pressing for the implementation of all the recommendations of the investigation."
A Conservative spokesman urged witnesses to come forward if they had previously felt unable to do so. "If anyone felt they were unable to come forward whilst Rob Semple [was] in the board meeting where the Clifford Chance report was discussed, we would urge them now to do so."
Newsnight also learned that 15 key witnesses have called for the removal of a senior Conservative official from any involvement with the party's inquiry into the scandal.

Sebastian Coe denies he warned UKA of 2017 world championship bribes; 
â IAAF president said to have passed on rumours of 'brown envelopes' â Doha was London's main bidding rival for the showpiece event.

Owen Gibson.

Sebastian Coe, the under-fire president of the IAAF, has denied knowing that "bribes were being offered or received" in relation to the award of the 2017 World Athletics Championships after it was claimed that he passed on rumours of "brown envelopes".
After the Daily Mail reported it was Lord Coe to whom the UK Athletics chairman, Ed Warner, was referring when he told the BBC this month that a "senior IAAF official" had passed on claims of impropriety by the Doha bid, London's rivals for the 2017 championships, a spokesman for Coe moved to try to clarify his position. 
 Related:  Doha's bids for 2017 and 2019 world athletics championships under investigation
"Sebastian Coe had no actual knowledge of bribes being offered or received linked to the 2017 World Championships. As he and Ed Warner discussed on 5 Live Sportsweek there was rumour piled upon rumour in the days leading up to the bid as is often the case on these occasions," said the spokesman for the International Association of Athletics Federations.
At the time of the alleged conversation Coe was an IAAF vice-president and a key member of the London bid team that was ultimately successful in winning the vote. Doha later won the right to host the 2019 World Championships.
Both bids are now under investigation by the IAAF's ethics commission in the wake of the string of corruption allegations that have brought athletics to its knees. The Qatar Athletics Federation has consistently denied wrongdoing.
Asked by MPs on the culture, media and sport select committee earlier this week to name the IAAF official that had told him about the alleged bribes, Warner refused and said he planned to speak to the ethics commission first.
Challenged on Sportsweek by Garry Richardson, Warner acknowledged it was a "rumour of a rumour". But when Coe was then asked on the same programme whether he had heard the story before, he said: "No, I haven't. But Ed is right. Whenever you're in a bidding process ... every sport has their rumour, rumour piled upon rumour."
He went on to say that French prosecutors were now looking into it and that he had launched an internal review that would lead to the bids being "called in" if wrongdoing was proved.
Warner was asked by MPs why he did not report the rumours at the time and Coe is now sure to face similar questions as he battles to prove he can reform the embattled governing body in the midst of a spiralling doping and corruption scandal.
In December 2014 the Guardian revealed that Papa Massata Diack, the son of Coe's disgraced predecessor Lamine who is now wanted by Interpol, appeared to have asked for a payment of $5m from Qatar at a time when it was bidding for 2017.
The IAAF ethics commission has also alleged that Kenyan officials were given two cars during the 2019 bidding process.
Hugh Robertson, the then sports minister who was also part of the London 2017 team, said the atmosphere was febrile on the eve of the bid but that he didn't recall the specific allegations.
"When I got there, it was a feverish atmosphere with all sorts of rumour and counter rumour. There was a panic about the fact that Doha would pay the prize money and another panic about the fact they were offering sponsorship deals," he told the Guardian.
"I do not remember specific allegations of brown envelopes changing hands on that occasion. Given my relationship with both Seb and Ed Warner, I think it is inconceivable that they wouldn't have told me."
But Damian Collins, the Tory MP who sits on the CMS select committee, said it raised new questions for Coe. "If he knew about the brown envelopes, why has this only now been referred to the IAAF ethics committee now that Ed Warner has put in the public domain? When he appeared before the select committee, Seb Coe said specifically that he was unaware of bribes being paid," he said.

Care cuts criticised after sharp rise in ambulance calls to over-90s; 
Number of people aged 90 and over arriving at hospital in England by ambulance has risen by 61% in five years, NHS figures show.

Denis Campbell Health policy editor.

Soaring numbers of people aged 90 and over are being taken to hospital by ambulance, adding to the pressures on A&E units and already crowded wards, NHS figures show.  
A total of 325,086 men and women aged 90+ arrived at hospital in England by ambulance in 2014/15, up 61% on five years ago, according to the Health and Social Care Information Centre.
Heidi Alexander, the shadow health secretary, said cuts to social care were having a knock-on effect on the NHS. "These figures confirm that the elderly are bearing the brunt of David Cameron's A&E crisis. It is nothing short of a scandal that thousands of frail elderly people are being rushed through towns by the ambulance service, only to be left in overcrowded A&E departments," she said.
"The severe cuts we have seen to social care under the Tories have left too many older people without the support they need to remain independent in their own homes. Unless Tory ministers address the growing crisis in older people's care, the pressure on hospitals will only be exacerbated."
 Related:  Discussing how we live out our golden years is crucial - but oft-neglected | Celine Gounder
Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, said last month that ministers needed to do much more to improve social care to relieve pressure on overstretched hospitals. 
He told the NHS England board that "the level of patient demand on the NHS is partly a function of the availability of social care, particularly for frail older people". Despite a new 2% council tax levy to fund better social care, he added, provision would continue to worsen.
Professor Keith Willett, NHS England's director for acute care, said: "These figures prove what NHS England has known for a long time, that our A&E departments are coming under sustained and unprecedented pressure, this is particularly the case for our eldest citizens. Despite this our frontline staff continue to provide excellent services."
A Department of Health spokesman rejected Labour's claims. "This is scaremongering nonsense - more people are living longer so we would expect more 90 year olds to be taken to hospital. If someone needs an ambulance it is because they have an urgent health need and should be treated at hospital, not in the community or at home. 
 "We know the NHS is busier than ever which is why we've invested Â£10bn to fund the NHS's own plan for the future including Â£3.8bn now to help this year, and our Better Care Fund is getting NHS and social care services working together to keep people well and avoid coming to hospital in the first place."

The Guardian view on the Lloyds sale: better never than late; 
The chancellor has sensibly ducked out of a rushed sale of bank shares. But this delay does not change the basic direction of a doctrinaire privatisation programme.

Editorial.

Students of privatisation over the years have learnt to be grateful for small mercies. It is, for sure, better that George Osborne has, for the moment, pulled back from dumping the taxpayers' shares in Lloyds on to a bearish market, than it would have been for him to plough stubbornly ahead. Before last year's election the chancellor bragged that the national debt would fall faster than expected, a claim that turned out to depend on selling things like Lloyds, which flatters the books but does nothing at all for the public sector's balance sheet. So it is a relief to learn, now the election is won, that the desperation for cash upfront can be somewhat tempered by concern about the available price. 
But Mr Osborne is merely slowing the pace, not changing course, on a deeply ideological privatisation programme. There has not been the same noise as there was when the Thatcher government urged everybody to Tell Sid about the British Gas prospectus, nor the same buzz as there was when middle Britons who had never previously thought of buying stocks posted off a cheque for BT shares. Quietly, however, Mr Osborne has been breaking records. The Press Association tots up a total of Â£26bn in asset sales last year - including the state's Eurostar stake, 30% of the Royal Mail and a slice of Lloyds. This surpasses the previous high of Â£20bn, set way back in 1987, when Rolls-Royce and British Airways were sold.
Back then, a Conservative government also exhibited a strong doctrinaire preference for private over public ownership. But after the mix of inflation, stagnation and strikes which had characterised Britain's economic history in the 1970s, the privatisation argument had some appeal to middle-of-the-road pragmatists too, and especially for the likes of BA and Rolls, players in increasingly competitive markets, where commercial freedoms seemed important. The contrast with today is stark. The great scars on the economy's back in 2016 were not put there by strike-happy, overstaffed nationalised industries, but rather by predatory and under-regulated banks. The public enemy should, surely, not be the sort of plodding bureaucrat who used to run the Yorkshire Water Board, but rather the slickly suited profiteer who got paid an order of magnitude more for gambling with other people's money. Lloyds and the other big banks were virtually all disgraced, either in the crisis itself, or else in one or another of the scandals that broke in its aftermath: mass mis-selling, Libor rigging and the laundering of Mexican drug money.
Today's middle-of-the-road pragmatists, one might imagine, would be attracted to breaking up the big banks and setting up state-run challengers, not inviting the bankers to return to business as normal by selling the public stake. Finance is a special case after the crisis, perhaps, but new blights are emerging on the wider record of privatisation too. This young year has already seen MPs condemn a weak regulator for allowing excessive water charges, and David Cameron blast the energy giants for failing to cut bills in line with tumbling costs in world markets. In telecoms - which used to be deemed the archetypal privatisation success - BT got the green light to acquire EE, a move away from the promised privatisation end-point, of a competitive market where the customer is sovereign, and a move towards an oligopoly, where a few big firms call the shots.
So if there is one cheer for the delay in the Lloyds sale, to earn three the chancellor would have had to cancel the whole flotation, unless and until it could be convincingly fitted into a fundamental programme of bank reform of which there is no sign. But then the chancellor's scramble to find British assets to sell into the hands of a Chinese communist state suggests that privatisation is today more of a product of compulsive habit rather than critical thought. It once had its pragmatic advocates. These days, however, privatisation looks like a triumph of the rightwing heart over the dispassionate head.

Tory bullying inquiry: official seen as 'witness obstacle' steps down; 
Volunteers' chair Rob Semple steps aside after pressure from parents of Tory activist Elliott Johnson, who took his own life.

A Conservative official has stepped aside from the investigation into the death of Elliott Johnson, and bullying in the youth wing of the party, following pressure from the Tory activist's parents. 
Rob Semple, chair of the Tory volunteers' organisation, the National Convention, was on the board which was due to consider a report by the law firm Clifford Chance. However Semple had been named by up to 15 potential witnesses as the reason why they would not give evidence.
The inquiry is to look at events linked to Johnson's reported suicide and to the alleged activities of Mark Clarke, a Tory election aide who ran the Road Trips campaign, transporting young activists around the country.
Elliott, a Nottingham University graduate and an activist with the rightwing campaign group Conservative Way Forward, was found on the railway tracks at Sandy station, in Bedfordshire, on 15 September 2015.
Lord Feldman, the Conservatives' chairman, is among those giving evidence to the investigation, which will cover allegations of bullying, sexual misconduct and blackmail involving Clarke, which he had categorically denied.
From the start the inquiry has been dogged by accusations of it not being sufficiently independent from the Conservatives.
BBC's Newsnight reported claims last week that Semple's role was proving a block to the progress of the investigation, which was taken out of the hands of the Tory party and handed to the the law firm before Christmas. It said that up to 15 key witnesses were reluctant to give evidence because of Semple's alleged political links to Clarke in the past.
Johnson's parents have also complained about being kept in the dark about the report and progress of the investigation. 
On Thursday, Semple released a statement saying he was stepping down after seeing an interview with the Johnsons on the BBC. "As a father myself, the wishes of Mr and Mrs Johnson are paramount to me and after seeing their interview on BBC TV, I have decided to recuse myself from the board meeting that will discuss the Clifford Chance report. 
"As a Conservative volunteer for 20 years I want to establish the truth of what happened to Elliott. I am convinced the investigation will be fair and thorough, and my decision must not be regarded as my accepting any suggestion that I would be less than impartial. As chairman of the voluntary party I will be pressing for the implementation of all the recommendations of the investigation."
A Conservative spokesman urged witnesses to come forward if they had previously felt unable to do so. "If anyone felt they were unable to come forward whilst Rob Semple [was] in the board meeting where the Clifford Chance report was discussed, we would urge them now to do so."
Newsnight also learned that 15 key witnesses have called for the removal of a senior Conservative official from any involvement with the party's inquiry into the scandal.

Laquan McDonald shooting: officer's dashcam mic 'intentionally destroyed'; 
Maintenance records reveal that Chicago police officers have been involved in routine destruction and sabotage of dashboard cameras and microphones.

Jamiles Lartey.

The microphone equipment for the dashboard camera in the cruiser in which Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke was riding on the night he fatally shot 17-year-old Laquan McDonald had been "intentionally destroyed", according to maintenance documents first acquired by DNAinfo.

The records, which include service requests on hundreds of Chicago police vehicles, show that officers have routinely been involved in the intentional destruction and sabotage of body-worn microphones that sync with dashboard camera video.
After the video of the Laquan McDonald shooting was released in November, it was discovered that as much as 80% of the department's dashcam footage was missing audio. This was determined to be due to technical failure, human error or in some cases, according to police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi, "intentional destruction".
William Calloway, a Chicago activist who was instrumental in obtaining the release of the Laquan McDonald footage, said the logs proved a premeditated effort by officers to avoid transparency. 
"They are intentionally sabotaging this audio equipment because in their mind, they're going to do something wrong or reckless when they're outside on the beat," Calloway said. 
He added that he was "absolutely not shocked or surprised about it at all".
The records show that the dashcam in Van Dyke's vehicle, 6412, was repaired on 17 June 2014, about three months after it was reported broken. The next day, the system was reported broken again. What technicians called "intentional damage" was not repaired until 8 October 2014, DNAinfo reported.
On 20 October, the dashcam (and one in another car) recorded Van Dyke's fatal shooting of McDonald. The next month, technicians noted the missing audio in the car's footage and suggested "it is apparent from the uploaded videos that personnel have failed to sync the mics". 
In November 2015, after the video emerged, Van Dyke was charged with homicide. 
At least six other vehicle records show technicians noting that officers had not synced their microphones. Thirty service records show cases where either mics were not synced correctly or had been "intentionally defeated". 
More than 100 records show systems missing microphones, or having damaged systems with missing components such as batteries and antennas.
Before the files were released, in December, Fraternal Order of Police president Dean Angelo scoffed at the idea that officers were intentionally disabling units. 
"If they're claiming officers are purposely breaking things, then where is the history of that? Are [officers] being written up? Does the department have documentation to back those claims up? I'd like to see it," Angelo told DNAinfo.
In December, the Chicago Sun-Times reported that before the McDonald video was released, some officers threw their microphones on to a station roof, apparently in protest about having to be recorded. A sergeant who saw the incident reported it to the Independent Police Review Authority.
The Chicago police department owns a long legacy of misconduct that includes torture scandals concerning Commander John Burge and Detective Richard Zuley, and the operation of the Homan Square "black site".
The most recent scandal, over an apparent attempt to cover up the Laquan McDonald shooting, has resulted in a US Department of Justice investigation.

As we give up on saving, we give up on our future; 
For millions of us, the idea of planning for the long term no longer makes sense. We're living for the moment, and the implications are terrifying.

Gaby Hinsliff.

Once upon a time there was a Frenchwoman who made it her life's mission to save two of everything. Not just a spare for every possible eventuality - filling every cupboard to bursting, littering her cellar - but a twin for every object she owned, right down to table lamps.
This hoarding made no sense at all, until it emerged that her grandfather once saved his family's lives during the war by producing a spare reel of thread for a German soldier who needed to repair his uniform. Without that favour, they could have died. And so even as an adult, she could only feel safe so long as she had one of everything in reserve. 
Although Madame Rosen the hoarder is nominally fictional - she's a character in Muriel Barbery's novel The Elegance of the Hedgehog - one senses her creation must have been inspired by a true story. The children of wartime refugees often have family anecdotes of slightly demented scrimping and saving, drawers full of oddments that will patently never be used. We all save to feel secure, and not merely financially; even if it's only spare coppers in a jar, saving makes us feel more in control of our destinies, more confident of facing down unknown threats.
But saving isn't just about holding off the darkness. To save is to plan, to imagine a future and work towards it: just ask any teacher. Saving teaches self-discipline, impulse control, the ability to forgo instant gratification in exchange for future reward - all the things famously measured by the Stanford marshmallow test, in which four-year-olds were offered the choice of one marshmallow now or two if they could bear to wait 15 minutes.
What makes the experiment so famous is that the minority of kids who successfully resisted temptation didn't just grow up to get higher exam scores, but were also still leading more successful lives four decades later. But what if it had all been a con, and there hadn't been a second marshmallow? What happens when you save and save for a whole lot less reward than expected?
Anyone with a mortgage will probably have breathed a faint sigh of relief this week when Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, made clear that interest rates weren't about to rise after all (with the tacit implication that it's no longer clear when they will).
But it's a very different picture for savers, gloomily watching their nest eggs shrink in real terms. The paltry interest earned in the average high street bank account is so quickly outstripped by inflation that you might almost as well keep cash in a biscuit tin under the bed. And that's no longer the only threat to what, in Britain, was never a terribly strong savings culture to start with. The next big battle will be over pensions.
I know, I know: nobody wants to read about pensions. Pensions are boring snoring, except when you briefly consider how long you might be living on one, when they become briefly terrifying. That's why outrage over pink lady razors costing more than identical men's ones is headline news, and the fury of older women only now realising they'll be hit by a sudden rise in pensionable age is not.
But it's perhaps also why politicians are increasingly tempted by complex, interminably tedious pension reforms as a means of slashing state spending. After all, it could be years before anyone realises. So skip the rest of the piece by all means - just don't say you weren't warned.
The unlucky generation for whom life basically consists of realising you can't have the stuff your parents took for granted - free higher education, say, or home ownership - now find a decent pension is the next thing in the line of fire. They now face an erosion of incentives to save, shaky confidence in scandal-ridden financial institutions, and perhaps the kind of stock market volatility currently busy wiping billions off pension funds. (Those bankers you saw losing their shirts this week? Strictly speaking that was your shirt, if you've got money in a pension.)
The Treasury swears it's genuinely undecided over proposals to slash the tax relief that higher-rate earners enjoy on pension contributions, or to reduce the amount that can be sheltered in pensions. But the smoke signals emerging are enough to worry both Tory MPs and the Daily Mail, which this week began campaigning vigorously to save middle-class pensions.
Many won't weep for the squeezed upper middle, of course. Chipping away at tax reliefs that benefit the relatively wealthy is one of the most progressive things George Osborne has done - even if the fear is that the genuinely rich will simply find somewhere else to shelter their loot, leaving people who can't afford fancy accountants to bear the brunt.
But the knottier problem is with the millions who aren't saving for retirement because they can't afford to - and with a fast-growing army of self-employed people for whom the whole thing increasingly doesn't seem to add up (which might be why they are three times less likely than wage slaves to have a pension).
What if work dried up tomorrow, and you needed the cash in a hurry? Is it really safe to tie up every spare penny in something that, as the small print always says, can go down as well as up - especially if there's no employer helpfully topping the whole thing up? In a world of increasingly insecure casualised labour and dwindling returns, suddenly that promised second marshmallow starts to look a pretty sad, half-nibbled prospect - barely worth waiting for.
So, like those millennials who are increasingly giving up on saving for a deposit because the whole idea of buying a house seems so impossibly out of reach, the temptation is just to live for the moment. Spend money on stuff that makes life worth living now, try not to think about what comes next, embark on what basically amounts to a gigantic game of chicken with those future governments who will be in charge when we all retire into penury.
And that's the real problem about chipping away, little by little, at saving. It's not just the act of saving money itself you're destroying, although the economic implications of that are bleak enough. It's the idea that individuals have some control over their own future lives, that self-sacrifice will be rewarded - and that the people in charge weren't lying about the second marshmallow.

Osborne suspends Lloyds share sale; UK growth hits 0.5% - as it happened;

 Closing summary: Lloyds, growth, tax and HBOS probe  
It's been an awfully busy day, so let's wrap up with a reminder of the key points (with links to the appropriate news stories)
 The government has  slammed the brakes on its plan to sell its stake in Lloyds Banking Group to the public. 
Chancellor George Osborne said it would have been "frankly quite irresponsible" to press on with the sale when Lloyds shares are just 64p, compared to a break-even price of 74p.
City analysts say Osborne made the right decision, but political opponents have claimed he was reckless in pushing for the sale at all.

The UK economy has posted its weakest annual growth in three years.
New GDP figures showed that the economy expanded by 1.9% year-on-year in the last three months of 2015. On a quarterly basis, GDP rose by 0.5%.

City regulators have reopened investigations into the senior managers who ran HBOS, before its collapse in 2007.  
The probe could lead to former HBOS being banned from the City for mismanaging the bank, which was rescued by Lloyds - triggering a taxpayer-led bailout (and leaving George Osborne with a lot of shares to sell)

The EC has proposed new rules to prevent multinational companies gaming the system and avoiding paying a fair rate of tax. 
Announcing the move, commissioners Pierre Moscovici vowed to 'name and shame' those who didn't play by the rules, but denied planning to impose a flat rate of corporation tax across the EU.
He also confirmed the EU could investigate the UK's new tax deal with Google.

 And it's been another volatile day in the markets.  Oil soared, then subsided, when rumours of OPEC supply cuts were denied.
Traders were cautious, after the US Federal Reserve said last night it was watching the global economic and financial system closely. 
The FTSE 100 shed 1%, or 58 points, to close at 5931. And there were bigger losses across Europe, on concerns that global economic problems is hurting Europe's recovery.
Conner Campbell of Spreadex has the details:
The UK index has flailed about for much of the day, only just recovering from its lunch-time losses to start the US session flat. The Eurozone was a whole different story; plunging nearly 1.5% the DAX got a taste of the dramatic today, struggling in the face of Germany's weak inflation and import prices figures.
This helped drag the CAC with it, though the French index was slightly less hysterical, tumbling around 35 points as the day wore on.

 There's also speculation that Lloyds could be planning to set even more money aside to cover Payment Protection Insurance compensation. 
The chancellor might want to keep the share sale off the table, until the PPI scandal is off the agenda again.
Raul Sinha, banking analyst at JPMorgan Chase said:
"We are estimating that Lloyds will take Â£3bn of PPI provisions up to 2018 and the market fears that they might decide to take some of that now."
Yesterday, Royal Bank of Scotland announced another Â£500m to cover PPI claims, while Santander put aside Â£450m. 
PPI has already cost Lloyds an eye-watering Â£14bn, making it the biggest culprit.

 Susan Kramer, Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman, has criticised the chancellor for his eagerness to sell the government's remaining stake in Lloyds:
She said (via the Financial Times):
 "George Osborne's dash to sell off the public's stake in Lloyds as soon as possible was already a bad idea.
"It is worrying that it has taken a major collapse in global economic confidence to finally make him see sense."

The FTSE 100 index of blue chip shares listed in London has now shed 97 points, or 1.6%, to 5892. Not a great environment to be launching the Lloyds retail share offering.
The German DAX has slumped by 2.4%.
And on Wall Street, the Dow Jones is now in the red, extending yesterday's losses.
The selloff also follows some disappointing US economic data, showing a big drop in durable goods production (that machinery and long-lasting goods).
Capital Economics explains:
The 5.1% m/m decline in durable goods was due primarily to a sharp decline in the notoriously volatile aircraft component. Nevertheless, the details suggest that equipment investment shrank in the fourth quarter.

 Nils Pratley: Economic fears have pushed Lloyds shares down  
 Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, agrees that Osborne couldn't have got away with selling Lloyds to the public on the cheap. 
But the chancellor should consider exactly why the bank's shares have fallen so much this year.
He writes:
Before Osborne spends too much time congratulating himself on his "responsible" move, he should ask why Lloyds' share price has fallen by a quarter since last May's election.
Yes, those pesky turbulent markets are a major contributor. But Lloyds - more than any other big UK bank - is also a proxy for the market's view of the health of the UK economy. Investors sense bigger problems for the chancellor than an embarrassing delay in a Â£2bn share-sale.

 City firm IG reckons that the Lloyds share sale will be a success, eventually. 
IG analyst Chris Beauchamp reports that there's plenty of public interest in it:
"Research conducted by IG shows there is significant public appetite for the Lloyds share offer, with 43% of the UK adult population being aware of the offer and 6% likely to apply.
This is the equivalent of 2.4 million people, which exceeds the government's goal of engaging 2 million investors based on them investing Â£1000.
But who are those 2 million people? I'd guess that many of them will be experienced investors, who aren't daunted by the City, and who also have a spare grand to invest.

Is Osborne justified in blaming 'market turbulence' for scuppering the Lloyd sale ( at least temporarily )?
I think so. The FTSE 100 has fallen by around 7% since last October, but bank shares have suffered a steeper decline - as this chart shows.
    jan28bankshares1 Photograph: AJ Bell   
And other global markets have seen bigger losses. German's DAX index has lost almost 9% since the start of this year, a period in which Japan's Nikkei is down 10%.
Economic problems in China, the oil price rout, and fears of a global slowdown and rising deflation have all spooked investors this year. There's little prospect of Lloyds share price surging from 63p to the 74p break-even point anytime soon.
block-time published-time 2.10pm GMT 
 Pausing the Lloyds float is embarrassing for the government, but it does avoid the possibility of a failed privatisation. 
Russ Mould, investment director at stockbrokers AJ Bell, says a Lloyds flop could have undermined the zeal for Thatcherite privatisations.
He says:
"Osborne will clearly be looking for a better deal for the Government, to maximise returns as best he can, and he won't want any issue that was aiming for substantial involvement from private investors to be a flop.
That would damage already fragile sentiment and make it harder for any future privatisations to do well.
It's more than two years since the government sold off Royal Mail, prompting claims that it had sold the firm off far too cheaply.
Royal Mail shares are worth 450p today, around a third higher than the 330p float price, and peaked at over Â£6.
 That's the problem with flotations. If shares slide, they were a rip-off. And if they surge, then the company was sold off too cheaply.

block-time published-time 1.16pm GMT 
 Banking analyst Ian Gordon says George Osborne has made the right call given the circumstances. 
The Press Association has the details:
Lloyds shares were to be offered to retail investors at a 5% discount to the market price, with a bonus share for every 10 shares held by the investors for more than a year. 
"If Osborne were to have gone ahead with the sale to retail investors... this would have produced an effective price of sub 60 pence," said Investec analyst Ian Gordon. 
"That would be politically and economically impossible to justify. So I think that this (decision) is perfectly sensible." 
block-time published-time 1.06pm GMT 
A Downing Street spokesperson has also blamed the current stock market volatility for the decision to postpone the Lloyds retail offering, saying: 
"It's important that any share sale delivers value for money and we have to take account of current market conditions." 
And the market conditions aren't great today. After a calm start, the FTSE 100 has now fallen by 30 points or 0.5% to 5958.
Lloyds shares have dropped by 1.5% to 63.93p -- around 10p shy of the break-even level ( as explained earlier ).

 Lloyds Banking Group has issued a statement:
"The Government has already been able to progressively reduce its stake in the Group from 43% to just 9% today, returning over Â£16 billion to taxpayers at a profit. This reflects the hard work undertaken over the last four years to transform the Group into a simple, low-risk and customer-focused bank. The timing of any future retail sale is a matter for the Government.
Our focus is on moving the Group forward so that it can continue to be profitable and deliver sustainable returns to all our shareholders."

 Sky News also ask George Osborne if he regrets calling the Â£130m Google tax deal a major success ( when speaking to the Guardian at the World Economic Forum in Davos last Saturday ). 
Osborne says that his only interest as chancellor of the exchequer is to get the best deal for Britain. Google used to pay no tax, now it is paying tax.
And he cites his new diverted profits tax, which is aimed at large multinationals who artificially shift their profits offshore.
I regard that as a major success, he adds. Clearly there is more to do, and the ultimate solution is to create more succesful UK companies.

Q: Is the sale of Royal Bank of Scotland shares also going to be postponed?
Osborne says he will continue, when it's right, to sell RBS shares to the market. 
"My interest is a bank that works for the British people, that's out there lending to businesses, but also ensuring that over time we do get out of that bank. We will continue to make sales to the market.
Britain currently owns around 70% of Royal Bank of Scotland, whose share price is around half the break-even price of 500p. The government is aiming to sell shares to City institutions, rather than to the public.

 Hundreds of thousands of small investors will be disappointed by the postponement of the Lloyds shares sale, says  Laith Khalaf of Hargreaves Lansdown. 
He points out that Osborne had promised to sell the shares at a 5% discount to the market price, so he must now hope for a recovery in markets later in the year.
Market volatility in recent months has seen UK stock market values fall by around 20% since the April 2015 high, so its understandable that the share sale is being delayed.
The government are committed to returning the Bank to private hands and within that had previously pledged to offer at least Â£2 billion as a retail offering. Therefore we expect this share sale to proceed at some stage but the timescales are unknown.

 News story: Another Osborne u-turn  
 For anyone just tuning in, here's our news story on the Lloyds share sale suspension: 
George Osborne has postponed the sale of the last taxpayer-owned tranche of Lloyds Bank shares this spring, blaming "market turbulence".
The chancellor pledged in last year's election manifesto to sell the remaining stake in the bank - just under 10% of the company - to the public this spring.
However, he told Sky News and other broadcasters that he has decided to delay the sale following the sharp selloff in stock markets in recent weeks.
Several indices, including London's leading share index, entered bear market territory earlier this month, pressured by the slump in oil prices coupled with concerns about China and global economic slowdown. The FTSE has recovered this week but it global equity markets remain volatile.
The Lloyds share price has dropped more than 10% below the price at which the government would make a profit from the share sale.
Osborne told reporters that:
I want to create a share-owning democracy. It's also my responsibility to ensure economic responsibility so with these turbulent financial markets now is not the right time to have that sale.
"We will sell Lloyds to the British people but we will do so when the time is right."
It is yet another U-turn on a manifesto pledge, following his change of heart over tax credit cuts in the autumn statement.

 Why Lloyds postponement is a headache for Osborne  
 By announcing the postponement today, George Osborne avoids breaking the bad news in March's budget. 
But this is still a blow to his plans, and probably means he'll need to borrow more money to balance the books.
The chancellor has billed the sale as the "biggest privatisation for 20 years". He was planning to raise Â£2bn through the retail offering to small shareholders that has now been halted.
Osborne announced the sale at the Tory party conference last October, telling activists that:
Next Spring, we will make Lloyds shares available to every member of the public. They'll be offered at a discount. Small shareholders will get priority, and long-term investors will get a bonus. 
You can register from today. It's the biggest privatisation for more than twenty years.
And every penny we raise will be used to pay off our debts.
So, with the Google tax row gathering pace, this is turning into a week to forget for the chancellor.
block-time published-time 11.30am GMT 
 Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, warned two weeks ago that the Lloyds share sale was in trouble. 
He wrote: 
Under the drip-feed programme [sales to City firms], which has reduced the state's stake to 9%, sales are prohibited below 73.6p, the break-even price.
And, if the drip-feed programme is stalled, can Osborne really go ahead with his parallel idea to exit Lloyds with a flourish this spring by selling Â£2bn worth of discounted shares to the public?
Technically, he can. But it would be highly embarrassing, politically speaking, to sell Lloyds shares to private punters at a loss to the public purse.

Q: These proposals still allow companies to shift profits to other EU, or non-EU countries. Won't that simply lead to a race to the bottom, as member states cut their corporation tax bills.
We don't want to impose corporation tax at the national level, Pierre Moscovici reiterates. But there are also fiscal rules, public services to fund, which means countries cannot afford a race to the bottom.
Q: And will you impose more punitive measures, if we don't see the (EURO)50bn-(EURO)70bn lost to tax evasion flooding into EU coffers.
That's an official estimate, but we won't use it as a benchmark of success, Moscovici says.
block-time published-time 10.57am GMT 
Q: Which countries are helping multinational companies avoid paying fair tax? Switzerland, perhaps?
I was at Davos last week, says Moscovici. I met the new Swiss minister for finance, and we agreed that the excellent co-operation that exists between the EC and Switzerland would continue.
A recent EC-Swiss agreement means that the banking secrecy no longer exists, and will aid the exchange of information, Moscovici adds. 
He doesn't want to point a finger at any countries, but wants to create a new system to prevent aggressive tax avoidance and boost transparency.

 Would EC's proposals hit Google?  
Q: Would these EC's new proposals on tax avoidance stop legal arrangements such as Google, where the UK operations are carried out by a separate company working for Google in Dublin, who is paid a fee, to ensure the UK operations make as small a profit as possible?
Moscovici says he can't talk directly about  the Google deal. however.
There are some measures inside our proposed directive that can address the issue.
Especially exit taxation, to prevent companies relocating assets purely to avoid taxation.
block-time published-time 10.50am GMT 
Q: How does this deal relate to the UK's controversial deal with Google, under which the search giant will pay Â£130m in back taxes?
Pierre Moscovici says they aren't directly linked.
The commission could investigate the UK's deal with Google, and the broad principle is that: 
All companies must pay their fair share of taxes, where they pay their profits.
That's why we have been active in preventing member states ability to offer sweetheart deals.
The measures I am announcing today will tackle the most common loopholes in international law, Moscovici insists. It should have a major impact in tackling aggressive tax planning.

Q: Won't these new rules penalise countries a long way from the centre of Europe, who might struggle to attract firms without an attractive corporation ?  ( Ireland, perhaps )

It is "too easy for companies to escape taxation by shifting assets to tax havens", Moscovici says, vowing to "name and shame" companies who don't play fair.

 UK economy ends year on 'soft note'  
Here's Reuters first take on the GDP figures (they've been in a lock-in at the Office for National Statistics): 
Britain's economy ended 2015 on a soft note after the annual pace of growth slowed to its weakest in nearly three years as the global economic slowdown weighed on its previously rapid expansion. 
Fourth-quarter gross domestic product grew by 0.5%, up slightly from 0.4% in the three months to September, the Office for National Statistics said on Thursday, and in line with economists' forecasts. 
Output in the three months to December was 1.9% higher than a year earlier, down from 2.1% in the third quarter and the smallest increase since early 2013. 
The figures are likely to ease worries that Britain is facing a sharp economic slowdown, as domestic demand appears to have remained resilient. But they suggest that the robust growth of the past two years will not return until the world economy regains strength.

 Gross domestic product is a blunt tool for assessing a country's economy. 
Although it measures activity within an economy, GDP doesn't assess the actual value of that work. Burning down a rainforest and building a new railway are seen in the same way.
And it doesn't measure inequality - whether the fruits of the economic success are shared fairly.
This message has finally filtered through to the global elite at Davos last week, where IMF chief Christine Lagarde called for a shake-up.
Lagarde told the World Economic Forum that:
"We have to go back to GDP, the calculation of productivity, the value of things - in order to assess, and probably change, the way we look at the economy."

However, a major spanner in the works could be thrown in if the day's first look at the UK's fourth quarter GDP disappoints. Analysts are expecting 0.5%, marginally better than the 0.4% seen back in Q3; yet there is more than a chance that the figure might underperform, with the Chinese slowdown, Brexit fears AND those weaker than hoped for Christmas retail sales all swirling around to potentially take a point or two off the reading.

Drinks giant Diageo, which makes Johnnie Walker scotch and Smirnoff vodka, reported a 1.8% rise in first-half sales. It took a hit from foreign exchange rates and the sale of assets, including its wine business.
Sweden's H&M has also been hit by the strong dollar, which drove up its purchasing costs (it buys most of its clothes in Asia in US dollars), and warned that big markdowns on winter wear will hurt its profit margins in the first quarter. Like rivals, the world's second-biggest fashion retailer pointed to the unusually warm weather in many part of Europe and north America, which put customers off buying winter clothes.

But the price cut does not even come close to the drop in wholesale gas prices, consumer experts point out.
Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis, founder of www.cheapenergyclub.co.uk, said:
Baaaah. SSE has bleated and followed Eon's price cut last week, the rest of the big six sheep will likely soon follow. And again it's just a trivial 5% on gas only not electricity, nothing close to the drop in wholesale prices. Energy firms must be whooping for joy that they can get away with such small cuts and have the energy minister praising them, albeit slightly. Yet the real picture here is that even after cuts the vast majority of households in the UK are massively overpaying for their energy.
E.ON and SEE customers with typical usage on their standard tariffs will be paying at least Â£1,050, after the cuts, and those from other firms even more. Yet the market's cheapest tariffs for switchers are around Â£770 a year on the same usage. And indeed both E.ON and SSE offer these for those who bother to switch."

 SSE cuts gas prices by 5.3% from end March  
SSE, one of Britain's big six energy companies, will cut its domestic gas prices by an average of 5.3% - but not until after Easter. The company said:
This latest reduction will save a typical household gas customer on our standard tariff Â£32 a year compared with existing prices."
The move, which takes effect on 29 March, comes a week after rival E.On reduced its gas prices by 5.1% from 1 February.
SSE said it lost 300,000 customers in the first nine months of its financial year, as customers defected to smaller utility firms - part of a wider trend. Customer accounts dropped to 8.28m by 31 December. Even so, the company stuck to its full-year adjusted earnings per share target of 115p and said it would hike its dividend at least in line with retail price inflation.

 China and Brexit fears may hit growth  
Some economists fear that UK growth slowed to just 0.3% in the last quarter, due to economic problems overseas and political uncertainty back home.
Others predict a healthy pick-up in GDP.
My colleague Katie Allen explains:
Economists forecast that the figures will show growth of 0.5% in the final three months of 2015, slightly faster than growth of 0.4% in the previous quarter, according to the consensus in a Reuters poll.
But with worries about China's downturn and the wider global economy clouding the outlook, there is significant uncertainty over the UK's performance. Individual economists' forecasts range from 0.3% to 0.6%. Weak retail sales figures for the key Christmas season
There have also been warnings from businesses that the looming EU referendum is hurting confidence and forcing some firms to put investment plans on hold. With polls pointing to a tight vote, the pound has fallen sharply in recent weeks.

Good morning.
We're about to find out how well, or badly, Britain's economy fared in the last three months of 2015.
Fresh GDP data for the October-December period is released at 9.30am. It will show how the UK performed during a time of growing worries about the global economy, and volatility in the markets.
Economists predict that the UK economy expanded by around 0.5% during the quarter. That would be a small improvement on the 0.4% growth posted in July-September, and fairly unremarkable compared with long-term averages.
But in the current climate, with China suffering a somewhat bumpy slowdown, any growth is better than nothing.
The figures have global significance; Britain is the first major advance economy to report fourth-quarter GDP data. 
As we covered in last night's blog, the US central bank has said it's watching the global economy and the markets closely.

Rupert Murdoch is no powerless taxpayer against Google; 
The mogul has lambasted Downing Street for yielding to lobbying over tax - but he himself is a political player with business reasons to attack the search giant.

Jane Martinson.

Has Rupert Murdoch given the world a new definition of the term "double irony"? No stranger to accusations of overweening political influence or questionable tax affairs, the media mogul waded into the scandal over Google's UK tax affairs by accusing the US tech giant of both.
His intervention - in a series of tweets condemning the "posh boys in Downing St" for succumbing to Google's "most brilliant new lobbying effort yet" - was classic Murdoch, coming after two days in a row of his Times newspaper splashing on stories about Google's paltry Â£130m tax deal.  
The media mogul, whose companies own the Sun and once owned the News of the World, has obviously forgotten the details of his own "people" who became close to government. 
 Related:  Murdoch lambasts Downing Street over 'easy' Google tax deal
Unfortunately for Murdoch, readers only need to Google the words " Andy Coulson " or " country suppers " to remind themselves of the phone-hacking scandal which cost Murdoch's business an estimated four times the back tax agreed to be paid by Google last week.
At least Murdoch did not attack the Tories, as the Times did, over the fact that Google's former head of communications Rachel Whetstone was the Camerons' eldest son's godmother. Once again a quick Google search of " Rupert Murdoch" and "godfather" will remind you of the close links between the media mogul's young daughter Grace and former prime minister Tony Blair.
Is it any wonder that Murdoch hates the search engine?
It is an outrage that Google, and so many huge multinational profitable businesses, pays so little tax. But then Murdoch's own tax affairs have exercised accountants for years. The holding company for his UK newspapers legally paid no corporation tax at all during the 1990s, while its less than Googleplex profits since have meant HMRC is hardly awash with Murdoch millions. His company tax affairs have also come under scrutiny in Australia.
As ever with Murdoch, there is a sound business reason for attacking a company that has filched so much advertising revenue from newspaper groups such as News UK (as well as other newspaper groups of course). 
This theme - the newspaper business will die if the likes of Google and Facebook continue to get away with the sort of tax avoidance press proprietors can only dream of - is a well worn one. 
In 2010, Murdoch and his senior executives ramped up the attack on a business they have accused of being a "parasite" on the news industry, saying: "We are going to stop people like Google or Microsoft or whoever from taking stories for nothing ... there is a law of copyright and they recognise it."
His words on influence and finances may be ironic, but there can be no doubt that in arguing about the impact of online competitors he articulated the fears of many in the newspaper industry who had started to see print circulations plummet and digital revenues fail to keep up.
After several more attacks by Murdoch and key lieutenant Robert Thomson, Google even tried to turn the news group's humour on itself with a laughing baby gif. 
In 2014 News Corp complained to European Union that Google was a "platform for piracy". It is to Europe that those who oppose the British laws that allow Google to pay a tax rate estimated at just 3% by the opposition leader are now looking for any hope of redress.
Politically, the attack on the paltry amount of tax paid by large US technology groups unites Murdoch's newspapers and Jeremy Corbyn for the first time. "Mr Corbyn was for once on the money," sniffed a Times leader on the issue on Thursday. 
Corbyn's decision to attack David Cameron on the issue during Prime Minister's Questions both puts him on the side of ordinary taxpayers who pay far more than 3% of their earnings and distances himself from the past leadership of the Labour party, who were memorably close to Murdoch.
The power of Murdoch himself can best be seen by the speed and fury of Tory MPs ready to criticise the Google tax deal even after George Osborne described it as a "major success". With a Tory leadership campaign looming, who wants to get on the wrong side of a man whose pet peeves can be on the front page of the Times and the Sun every day?
In its leader column on Thursday, the Times said that "institutions and individuals should be equal under the law". It didn't say "little people", for we all know that they are the ones who really pay their taxes rather than those "individuals" with the world's information resources at their fingertips and heads of states at their parties.

Danish PM counts on popular support in tackling refugees; 
Lars LÂ¯kke Rasmussen's tough stance has faced international criticism but opinion polls show it is backed in his own country.

Jon Henley.

Lars LÂ¯kke Rasmussen's customary jovial charm has been in short supply this week as Denmark faced a wave of international criticism following its parliament's decision to approve a new law drastically curbing refugees' rights.
Amnesty International, the European commission, the UN refugee agency and Human Rights Watch were among the organisations condemning the toughest measures yet enacted by an EU member to deter migrants, including a three-year delay for family reunifications and provision for police to confiscate refugees' valuables.
But analysts say Denmark's heavy-set, generally genial prime minister believes his minority centre-right government is simply responding to justifiable domestic concern about the impact of tens of thousands of refugees on social integration and the country's welfare state - and note that a large majority of MPs, and voters, agree. 
 Related:  Ai Weiwei shuts Danish show in protest at asylum-seeker law
Some 70% of Danes say immigration is their biggest political concern and opinion polls consistently showed most people backed the package, said Peter Nedergaard, the political science professor at Copenhagen University. "All the major parties, including the Social Democrats, were in agreement on this," Nedergaard said. "Danes saw this issue differently."
Rasmussen formed a government consisting solely of his Venstre party last June, despite losing votes and finishing third in elections  behind the Social Democrats of the outgoing premier, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, and the rightwing, anti-immigration populists of the Danish People's party (DPP), who emerged as the country's largest rightwing party with 21% of the vote.
With the rightwing, or "blue" bloc, in the 179-seat parliament marginally ahead of the leftwing, or "red" bloc, the 51-year-old law graduate and former consultant - seen as a seasoned and, despite some embarrassing but relatively minor expenses scandals, professional operator - was thought likely to govern in a coalition with the DPP. 
But the populist Eurosceptic party refused to back down on demands including a referendum on whether Denmark should stay in the EU, opting instead, as it did throughout the 2000s, to stay out of government and trade its parliamentary support for concessions - notably on ever-tighter immigration rules.
Rasmussen took a bold gamble, choosing to govern alone despite having the guaranteed votes of just 34 MPs in parliament. Since then, he has won majority support for a series of increasingly hardline anti-immigration measures, including a cut in benefits by up to 50% for newly arrived refugees. 
Last September, the government placed advertisements in Middle Eastern papers warning that entry regulations for refugees had been tightened and unsuccessful asylum seekers would be swiftly returned. In December, Rasmussen sparked further controversy by saying the 1951 refugee convention might need to be revised. 
If the influx of migrants entering Europe continued or got worse, he said, "we will get to the point where we'll have to talk - and Denmark won't be be able to do it alone - about changing the rules of the game".
But with more than 23,000 refugees arriving in Denmark in 2015 and a similar number expected this year, analysts said this week's vote should not be seen solely as the result of pressure from the DPP. 
For most Danes, Nedergaard said: "This is a question of equality and fairness. People are not anti-immigration as such, they are anti-immigration by those without a job. They are anti immigration that risks making integration more difficult, undermining the coherence of Danish society, harming the welfare state. They want the same approach taken to refugees and to Danes."
 Related:  Sofie GrÃbÂ¯l: 'I want to feel proud of Denmark, but it's not easy'
Inger StÂ¯jberg, Rasmussen's hardline immigration minster, argued that Denmark's expenditure on asylum seekers is the second highest in the EU as a proportion of GDP. Politicians from right and left pointed out that Danish citizens generally qualify for benefits only when their assets are nearly exhausted. 
Rasmussen - a former finance minister who was briefly Denmark's youngest prime minister between 2009-11 when his predecessor, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, resigned to become Nato secretary general - described the refugee law as "the most misunderstood bill in Denmark's history" and has dismissed the international criticism, which included a Steve Bell cartoon in the Guardian labelling Venstre as "probably the stupidest political party in the world".
Born in 1964 in the central Danish town of Vejle, Rasmussen has been active in centre-right politics since he became national chairman of the Young Liberals in 1986. As immigration has risen steadily to the top of the domestic political agenda, he has cut his cloth accordingly, talking increasingly tough on the issue, especially during last year's election campaign. 
At the end of the day, said Bjarne Steensbeck, a political commentator at the public broadcaster DR, "Rasmussen is elected in Denmark, and not by the international media".

And on Wall Street, the Dow Jones is now in the red, extending yesterday's losses.
The selloff also follows some disappointing US economic data, showing a big drop in durable goods production (that machinery and long-lasting goods).
Capital Economics explains:
The 5.1% m/m decline in durable goods was due primarily to a sharp decline in the notoriously volatile aircraft component. Nevertheless, the details suggest that equipment investment shrank in the fourth quarter.

 Nils Pratley: Economic fears have pushed Lloyds shares down  
 Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, agrees that Osborne couldn't have got away with selling Lloyds to the public on the cheap. 
But the chancellor should consider exactly why the bank's shares have fallen so much this year.
He writes:
Before Osborne spends too much time congratulating himself on his "responsible" move, he should ask why Lloyds' share price has fallen by a quarter since last May's election.
Yes, those pesky turbulent markets are a major contributor. But Lloyds - more than any other big UK bank - is also a proxy for the market's view of the health of the UK economy. Investors sense bigger problems for the chancellor than an embarrassing delay in a Â£2bn share-sale.

 City firm IG reckons that the Lloyds share sale will be a success, eventually. 
IG analyst Chris Beauchamp reports that there's plenty of public interest in it:
"Research conducted by IG shows there is significant public appetite for the Lloyds share offer, with 43% of the UK adult population being aware of the offer and 6% likely to apply.
This is the equivalent of 2.4 million people, which exceeds the government's goal of engaging 2 million investors based on them investing Â£1000.
But who are those 2 million people? I'd guess that many of them will be experienced investors, who aren't daunted by the City, and who also have a spare grand to invest.

Is Osborne justified in blaming 'market turbulence' for scuppering the Lloyd sale ( at least temporarily )?
I think so. The FTSE 100 has fallen by around 7% since last October, but bank shares have suffered a steeper decline - as this chart shows.
    jan28bankshares1 Photograph: AJ Bell   
And other global markets have seen bigger losses. German's DAX index has lost almost 9% since the start of this year, a period in which Japan's Nikkei is down 10%.
Economic problems in China, the oil price rout, and fears of a global slowdown and rising deflation have all spooked investors this year. There's little prospect of Lloyds share price surging from 63p to the 74p break-even point anytime soon.
block-time published-time 2.10pm GMT 
 Pausing the Lloyds float is embarrassing for the government, but it does avoid the possibility of a failed privatisation. 
Russ Mould, investment director at stockbrokers AJ Bell, says a Lloyds flop could have undermined the zeal for Thatcherite privatisations.
He says:
"Osborne will clearly be looking for a better deal for the Government, to maximise returns as best he can, and he won't want any issue that was aiming for substantial involvement from private investors to be a flop.
That would damage already fragile sentiment and make it harder for any future privatisations to do well.
It's more than two years since the government sold off Royal Mail, prompting claims that it had sold the firm off far too cheaply.
Royal Mail shares are worth 450p today, around a third higher than the 330p float price, and peaked at over Â£6.
 That's the problem with flotations. If shares slide, they were a rip-off. And if they surge, then the company was sold off too cheaply.

 Banking analyst Ian Gordon says George Osborne has made the right call given the circumstances. 
The Press Association has the details:
Lloyds shares were to be offered to retail investors at a 5% discount to the market price, with a bonus share for every 10 shares held by the investors for more than a year. 
"If Osborne were to have gone ahead with the sale to retail investors... this would have produced an effective price of sub 60 pence," said Investec analyst Ian Gordon. 
"That would be politically and economically impossible to justify. So I think that this (decision) is perfectly sensible."

And the market conditions aren't great today. After a calm start, the FTSE 100 has now fallen by 30 points or 0.5% to 5958.

Q: Is the sale of Royal Bank of Scotland shares also going to be postponed?
Osborne says he will continue, when it's right, to sell RBS shares to the market. 
"My interest is a bank that works for the British people, that's out there lending to businesses, but also ensuring that over time we do get out of that bank. We will continue to make sales to the market.
Britain currently owns around 70% of Royal Bank of Scotland, whose share price is around half the break-even price of 500p. The government is aiming to sell shares to City institutions, rather than to the public.

He points out that Osborne had promised to sell the shares at a 5% discount to the market price, so he must now hope for a recovery in markets later in the year.
Market volatility in recent months has seen UK stock market values fall by around 20% since the April 2015 high, so its understandable that the share sale is being delayed.
The government are committed to returning the Bank to private hands and within that had previously pledged to offer at least Â£2 billion as a retail offering. Therefore we expect this share sale to proceed at some stage but the timescales are unknown.

 News story: Another Osborne u-turn  
 For anyone just tuning in, here's our news story on the Lloyds share sale suspension: 
George Osborne has postponed the sale of the last taxpayer-owned tranche of Lloyds Bank shares this spring, blaming "market turbulence".
The chancellor pledged in last year's election manifesto to sell the remaining stake in the bank - just under 10% of the company - to the public this spring.
However, he told Sky News and other broadcasters that he has decided to delay the sale following the sharp selloff in stock markets in recent weeks.
Several indices, including London's leading share index, entered bear market territory earlier this month, pressured by the slump in oil prices coupled with concerns about China and global economic slowdown. The FTSE has recovered this week but it global equity markets remain volatile.
The Lloyds share price has dropped more than 10% below the price at which the government would make a profit from the share sale.
Osborne told reporters that:
I want to create a share-owning democracy. It's also my responsibility to ensure economic responsibility so with these turbulent financial markets now is not the right time to have that sale.
"We will sell Lloyds to the British people but we will do so when the time is right."
It is yet another U-turn on a manifesto pledge, following his change of heart over tax credit cuts in the autumn statement.

 Why Lloyds postponement is a headache for Osborne  
 By announcing the postponement today, George Osborne avoids breaking the bad news in March's budget. 
But this is still a blow to his plans, and probably means he'll need to borrow more money to balance the books.
The chancellor has billed the sale as the "biggest privatisation for 20 years". He was planning to raise Â£2bn through the retail offering to small shareholders that has now been halted.
Osborne announced the sale at the Tory party conference last October, telling activists that:
Next Spring, we will make Lloyds shares available to every member of the public. They'll be offered at a discount. Small shareholders will get priority, and long-term investors will get a bonus. 
You can register from today. It's the biggest privatisation for more than twenty years.
And every penny we raise will be used to pay off our debts.
So, with the Google tax row gathering pace, this is turning into a week to forget for the chancellor.
block-time published-time 11.30am GMT 
 Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, warned two weeks ago that the Lloyds share sale was in trouble. 
He wrote: 
Under the drip-feed programme [sales to City firms], which has reduced the state's stake to 9%, sales are prohibited below 73.6p, the break-even price.
And, if the drip-feed programme is stalled, can Osborne really go ahead with his parallel idea to exit Lloyds with a flourish this spring by selling Â£2bn worth of discounted shares to the public?
Technically, he can. But it would be highly embarrassing, politically speaking, to sell Lloyds shares to private punters at a loss to the public purse.

All companies must pay their fair share of taxes, where they pay their profits.

 UK economy ends year on 'soft note'  
Here's Reuters first take on the GDP figures (they've been in a lock-in at the Office for National Statistics): 
Britain's economy ended 2015 on a soft note after the annual pace of growth slowed to its weakest in nearly three years as the global economic slowdown weighed on its previously rapid expansion. 
Fourth-quarter gross domestic product grew by 0.5%, up slightly from 0.4% in the three months to September, the Office for National Statistics said on Thursday, and in line with economists' forecasts. 
Output in the three months to December was 1.9% higher than a year earlier, down from 2.1% in the third quarter and the smallest increase since early 2013. 
The figures are likely to ease worries that Britain is facing a sharp economic slowdown, as domestic demand appears to have remained resilient. But they suggest that the robust growth of the past two years will not return until the world economy regains strength.

 Gross domestic product is a blunt tool for assessing a country's economy. 
Although it measures activity within an economy, GDP doesn't assess the actual value of that work. Burning down a rainforest and building a new railway are seen in the same way.
And it doesn't measure inequality - whether the fruits of the economic success are shared fairly.
This message has finally filtered through to the global elite at Davos last week, where IMF chief Christine Lagarde called for a shake-up.
Lagarde told the World Economic Forum that:
"We have to go back to GDP, the calculation of productivity, the value of things - in order to assess, and probably change, the way we look at the economy."

The upward movement from Brent Crude has caused a wave of green to overcome the UK index's crucial oil and mining stocks, in turn allowing the FTSE to flirt seriously with the 6000 mark for the first time in a fortnight.
However, a major spanner in the works could be thrown in if the day's first look at the UK's fourth quarter GDP disappoints. Analysts are expecting 0.5%, marginally better than the 0.4% seen back in Q3; yet there is more than a chance that the figure might underperform, with the Chinese slowdown, Brexit fears AND those weaker than hoped for Christmas retail sales all swirling around to potentially take a point or two off the reading.

Here's a round-up of today's other corporate news:
Transport company FirstGroup warned profits would come in lower than expected. It blamed the recent wet weather and flooding in Britain and driver shortages in the US.
Drinks giant Diageo, which makes Johnnie Walker scotch and Smirnoff vodka, reported a 1.8% rise in first-half sales. It took a hit from foreign exchange rates and the sale of assets, including its wine business.
Sweden's H&M has also been hit by the strong dollar, which drove up its purchasing costs (it buys most of its clothes in Asia in US dollars), and warned that big markdowns on winter wear will hurt its profit margins in the first quarter. Like rivals, the world's second-biggest fashion retailer pointed to the unusually warm weather in many part of Europe and north America, which put customers off buying winter clothes.
 Jimmy Choo had a good 2015, as Asian shoppers snapped up its luxury shoes.

But the price cut does not even come close to the drop in wholesale gas prices, consumer experts point out.
Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis, founder of www.cheapenergyclub.co.uk, said:
Baaaah. SSE has bleated and followed Eon's price cut last week, the rest of the big six sheep will likely soon follow. And again it's just a trivial 5% on gas only not electricity, nothing close to the drop in wholesale prices. Energy firms must be whooping for joy that they can get away with such small cuts and have the energy minister praising them, albeit slightly. Yet the real picture here is that even after cuts the vast majority of households in the UK are massively overpaying for their energy.
E.ON and SEE customers with typical usage on their standard tariffs will be paying at least Â£1,050, after the cuts, and those from other firms even more. Yet the market's cheapest tariffs for switchers are around Â£770 a year on the same usage. And indeed both E.ON and SSE offer these for those who bother to switch."

 SSE cuts gas prices by 5.3% from end March  
SSE, one of Britain's big six energy companies, will cut its domestic gas prices by an average of 5.3% - but not until after Easter. The company said:
This latest reduction will save a typical household gas customer on our standard tariff Â£32 a year compared with existing prices."
The move, which takes effect on 29 March, comes a week after rival E.On reduced its gas prices by 5.1% from 1 February.
SSE said it lost 300,000 customers in the first nine months of its financial year, as customers defected to smaller utility firms - part of a wider trend. Customer accounts dropped to 8.28m by 31 December. Even so, the company stuck to its full-year adjusted earnings per share target of 115p and said it would hike its dividend at least in line with retail price inflation.

 China and Brexit fears may hit growth  
Some economists fear that UK growth slowed to just 0.3% in the last quarter, due to economic problems overseas and political uncertainty back home.
Others predict a healthy pick-up in GDP.
My colleague Katie Allen explains:
Economists forecast that the figures will show growth of 0.5% in the final three months of 2015, slightly faster than growth of 0.4% in the previous quarter, according to the consensus in a Reuters poll.
But with worries about China's downturn and the wider global economy clouding the outlook, there is significant uncertainty over the UK's performance. Individual economists' forecasts range from 0.3% to 0.6%. Weak retail sales figures for the key Christmas season
There have also been warnings from businesses that the looming EU referendum is hurting confidence and forcing some firms to put investment plans on hold. With polls pointing to a tight vote, the pound has fallen sharply in recent weeks.

 Introduction: It's UK GDP Day  
Good morning.
We're about to find out how well, or badly, Britain's economy fared in the last three months of 2015.
Fresh GDP data for the October-December period is released at 9.30am. It will show how the UK performed during a time of growing worries about the global economy, and volatility in the markets.
Economists predict that the UK economy expanded by around 0.5% during the quarter. That would be a small improvement on the 0.4% growth posted in July-September, and fairly unremarkable compared with long-term averages.
But in the current climate, with China suffering a somewhat bumpy slowdown, any growth is better than nothing.
The figures have global significance; Britain is the first major advance economy to report fourth-quarter GDP data. 
As we covered in last night's blog, the US central bank has said it's watching the global economy and the markets closely.

And domestically, the data are another quarterly term card report for George Osborne, and his management of the economy. It's likely that service sector firms provided most of the growth, not the industrial sector that the chancellor hoped to reinvigorate.

Care cuts criticised after sharp rise in ambulance calls to over-90s; 
Number of people aged 90 and over arriving at hospital in England by ambulance has risen by 61% in five years, NHS figures show.

Denis Campbell Health policy editor.

Soaring numbers of people aged 90 and over are being taken to hospital by ambulance, adding to the pressures on A&E units and already crowded wards, NHS figures show.  
A total of 325,086 men and women aged 90+ arrived at hospital in England by ambulance in 2014/15, up 61% on five years ago, according to the Health and Social Care Information Centre.
Heidi Alexander, the shadow health secretary, said cuts to social care were having a knock-on effect on the NHS. "These figures confirm that the elderly are bearing the brunt of David Cameron's A&E crisis. It is nothing short of a scandal that thousands of frail elderly people are being rushed through towns by the ambulance service, only to be left in overcrowded A&E departments," she said.
"The severe cuts we have seen to social care under the Tories have left too many older people without the support they need to remain independent in their own homes. Unless Tory ministers address the growing crisis in older people's care, the pressure on hospitals will only be exacerbated."
 Related:  Discussing how we live out our golden years is crucial - but oft-neglected | Celine Gounder
Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, said last month that ministers needed to do much more to improve social care to relieve pressure on overstretched hospitals. 
He told the NHS England board that "the level of patient demand on the NHS is partly a function of the availability of social care, particularly for frail older people". Despite a new 2% council tax levy to fund better social care, he added, provision would continue to worsen.
Responding to the HSCIC figures, an NHS England spokesman said: "In hospitals up and down the country there are many older people ready to go home but delays in support packages, home-care adaptations, domiciliary support or finding a care home place means spending another night in hospital.
 "The NHS five-year forward view sets out how the health service is transforming services for patients, with integration between health and care playing a key role. However, the main challenge we now all face is how to pay for an ageing population. The country needs a settled and durable new political consensus and this report is a positive contribution to that debate."

Decision to clear Malaysian prime minister 'impossible' to overturn; 
Exclusive: attorney general's ruling on $681m bank transfer from Saudi royal family can't be legally challenged, source close to Najib Razak tells the Guardian.

Oliver Holmes in Bangkok.

It would be constitutionally "impossible" to overturn the decision to clear the Malaysian prime minister, Najib Razak, of corruption, a source close to the PM's department has told the Guardian. 
The comments follow allegations that the country's attorney general had ignored a recommendation from the top anti-corruption body that Najib be charged for criminal misappropriation. 
The attorney general said on Tuesday that $681m transferred into Razak's personal bank account was a gift from the royal family in Saudi Arabia, and there were no criminal offences or corruption involved. The statement in effect ended the domestic investigation into Razak.
However, media reports subsequently quoted unnamed sources in the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) saying it had recommended Najib be charged. 
 Related:  Democracy falters in south-east Asia as Malaysia's PM cleared of corruption
"It's impossible for the attorney general's decision to be legally overturned," the source said, requesting anonymity as he was not allowed to speak publicly to the press. "Not even the highest court in Malaysia can. The constitution would have to be changed, and that's not going to happen."
Najib, who has weathered months of calls from opposition leaders and establishment figures to resign, has denied any wrongdoing and says he did not take any money for personal gain. 
The prime minister said on Tuesday that he welcomed the attorney general's comments, which "confirmed what I have maintained all along: that no crime was committed" and added that the "issue has been an unnecessary distraction for the country".
The MACC's chief commissioner, Abu Kassim Mohamed, said in a statement on Thursday that the body "is in no way disputing or challenging the attorney general's clearance of the cases against the prime minister". 
He added, however, that the clearance decision was being reviewed as "a standard operating procedure as part of the process of closing any case". Mohamed neither confirmed nor denied that the MACC had advised the attorney general to charge Najib but said he has instructed a police report to be filed into "unauthorised briefings to media".
In July, Najib sacked the country's previous attorney general, who had led the investigation up to that point, for "health reasons" in a government reshuffle that also saw the dismissal of several officials who had been critical of the premier.
The scandal has shaken investors in south-east Asia's third-biggest economy and rocked public confidence in the coalition led by Najib's United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) party, which has held power since independence in 1957. 
However, Najib still enjoys the backing of most of UMNO's powerful division chiefs. Even his fiercest internal critics, such as the influential former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad, accept that he cannot be unseated.

UK government halts Lloyds share sale amid market turbulence - business live; 
George Osborne's goal of creating a share owning democracy has been hit by falling stock marketsOsborne: Would be irresponsible to crack onFull Story: Lloyds share sale on holdEC announces crackdown on tax avoidanceCity regulators launch new HBOS probeUK GDP: growth rises to 0.5%.

 George Osborne took his mind off the Lloyds sale suspension and the Google tax tow with a trip to Airbus's factory in Filton this morning. 
Looks like the chancellor enjoyed himself:
block-time published-time 1.16pm GMT 
 Banking analyst Ian Gordon says George Osborne has made the right call given the circumstances. 
The Press Association has the details: 
Lloyds shares were to be offered to retail investors at a 5% discount to the market price, with a bonus share for every 10 shares held by the investors for more than a year. 
"If Osborne were to have gone ahead with the sale to retail investors... this would have produced an effective price of sub 60 pence," said Investec analyst Ian Gordon. 
"That would be politically and economically impossible to justify. So I think that this (decision) is perfectly sensible." 
block-time published-time 1.06pm GMT 
A Downing Street spokesperson has also blamed the current stock market volatility for the decision to postpone the Lloyds retail offering, saying: 
"It's important that any share sale delivers value for money and we have to take account of current market conditions." 
And the market conditions aren't great today. After a calm start, the FTSE 100 has now fallen by 30 points or 0.5% to 5958.
Lloyds shares have dropped by 1.5% to 63.93p -- around 10p shy of the break-even level ( as explained earlier ).
block-time published-time 12.43pm GMT 
 Lloyds Banking Group has issued a statement:
"The Government has already been able to progressively reduce its stake in the Group from 43% to just 9% today, returning over Â£16 billion to taxpayers at a profit. This reflects the hard work undertaken over the last four years to transform the Group into a simple, low-risk and customer-focused bank. The timing of any future retail sale is a matter for the Government.
Our focus is on moving the Group forward so that it can continue to be profitable and deliver sustainable returns to all our shareholders."
block-time published-time 12.24pm GMT 
 Sky News also ask George Osborne if he regrets calling the Â£130m Google tax deal a major success ( when speaking to the Guardian at the World Economic Forum in Davos last Saturday ). 
Osborne says that his only interest as chancellor of the exchequer is to get the best deal for Britain. Google used to pay no tax, now it is paying tax.
And he cites his new diverted profits tax, which is aimed at large multinationals who artificially shift their profits offshore.
I regard that as a major success, he adds. Clearly there is more to do, and the ultimate solution is to create more succesful UK companies.
enltrGeorge Osborne has just been interviewed by @EdConwaySky about the Google tax deal - and he's still using the phrase "a major success"

 Sky News just broadcast their interview with George Osborne. 
In it, he says it would be "frankly quite irresponsible" to embark on a major share sale when the markets are so volatile. His aim is to get the best deal for the public and the country.
Q: Is the sale of Royal Bank of Scotland shares also going to be postponed?
Osborne says he will continue, when it's right, to sell RBS shares to the market. 
"My interest is a bank that works for the British people, that's out there lending to businesses, but also ensuring that over time we do get out of that bank. We will continue to make sales to the market.
Britain currently owns around 70% of Royal Bank of Scotland, whose share price is around half the break-even price of 500p. The government is aiming to sell shares to City institutions, rather than to the public.

 Hundreds of thousands of small investors will be disappointed by the postponement of the Lloyds shares sale, says  Laith Khalaf of Hargreaves Lansdown. 
He points out that Osborne had promised to sell the shares at a 5% discount to the market price, so he must now hope for a recovery in markets later in the year.
Market volatility in recent months has seen UK stock market values fall by around 20% since the April 2015 high, so its understandable that the share sale is being delayed.
The government are committed to returning the Bank to private hands and within that had previously pledged to offer at least Â£2 billion as a retail offering. Therefore we expect this share sale to proceed at some stage but the timescales are unknown.

 News story: Another Osborne u-turn  
 For anyone just tuning in, here's our news story on the Lloyds share sale suspension: 
George Osborne has postponed the sale of the last taxpayer-owned tranche of Lloyds Bank shares this spring, blaming "market turbulence".
The chancellor pledged in last year's election manifesto to sell the remaining stake in the bank - just under 10% of the company - to the public this spring.
However, he told Sky News and other broadcasters that he has decided to delay the sale following the sharp selloff in stock markets in recent weeks.
Several indices, including London's leading share index, entered bear market territory earlier this month, pressured by the slump in oil prices coupled with concerns about China and global economic slowdown. The FTSE has recovered this week but it global equity markets remain volatile.
The Lloyds share price has dropped more than 10% below the price at which the government would make a profit from the share sale.
Osborne told reporters that:
I want to create a share-owning democracy. It's also my responsibility to ensure economic responsibility so with these turbulent financial markets now is not the right time to have that sale.
"We will sell Lloyds to the British people but we will do so when the time is right."
It is yet another U-turn on a manifesto pledge, following his change of heart over tax credit cuts in the autumn statement.

 Why Lloyds postponement is a headache for Osborne  
 By announcing the postponement today, George Osborne avoids breaking the bad news in March's budget. 
But this is still a blow to his plans, and probably means he'll need to borrow more money to balance the books.
The chancellor has billed the sale as the "biggest privatisation for 20 years". He was planning to raise Â£2bn through the retail offering to small shareholders that has now been halted.
Osborne announced the sale at the Tory party conference last October, telling activists that:
Next Spring, we will make Lloyds shares available to every member of the public. They'll be offered at a discount. Small shareholders will get priority, and long-term investors will get a bonus. 
You can register from today. It's the biggest privatisation for more than twenty years.
And every penny we raise will be used to pay off our debts.
So, with the Google tax row gathering pace, this is turning into a week to forget for the chancellor.
block-time published-time 11.30am GMT 
 Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, warned two weeks ago that the Lloyds share sale was in trouble. 
He wrote: 
Under the drip-feed programme [sales to City firms], which has reduced the state's stake to 9%, sales are prohibited below 73.6p, the break-even price.
And, if the drip-feed programme is stalled, can Osborne really go ahead with his parallel idea to exit Lloyds with a flourish this spring by selling Â£2bn worth of discounted shares to the public?
Technically, he can. But it would be highly embarrassing, politically speaking, to sell Lloyds shares to private punters at a loss to the public purse.

But Lloyds shares have shed a quarter of their value in the last eight months, and clearly the sale is no longer 'a goer'.

Q: These proposals still allow companies to shift profits to other EU, or non-EU countries. Won't that simply lead to a race to the bottom, as member states cut their corporation tax bills.
We don't want to impose corporation tax at the national level, Pierre Moscovici reiterates. But there are also fiscal rules, public services to fund, which means countries cannot afford a race to the bottom.
Q: And will you impose more punitive measures, if we don't see the (EURO)50bn-(EURO)70bn lost to tax evasion flooding into EU coffers.
That's an official estimate, but we won't use it as a benchmark of success, Moscovici says.

Q: Which countries are helping multinational companies avoid paying fair tax? Switzerland, perhaps?
I was at Davos last week, says Moscovici. I met the new Swiss minister for finance, and we agreed that the excellent co-operation that exists between the EC and Switzerland would continue.
A recent EC-Swiss agreement means that the banking secrecy no longer exists, and will aid the exchange of information, Moscovici adds. 
He doesn't want to point a finger at any countries, but wants to create a new system to prevent aggressive tax avoidance and boost transparency.

 Would EC's proposals hit Google?  
Q: Would these EC's new proposals on tax avoidance stop legal arrangements such as Google, where the UK operations are carried out by a separate company working for Google in Dublin, who is paid a fee, to ensure the UK operations make as small a profit as possible?
Moscovici says he can't talk directly about  the Google deal. however.
There are some measures inside our proposed directive that can address the issue.
Especially exit taxation, to prevent companies relocating assets purely to avoid taxation.
block-time published-time 10.50am GMT 
Q: How does this deal relate to the UK's controversial deal with Google, under which the search giant will pay Â£130m in back taxes?
Pierre Moscovici says they aren't directly linked.
The commission could investigate the UK's deal with Google, and the broad principle is that: 
All companies must pay their fair share of taxes, where they pay their profits.
That's why we have been active in preventing member states ability to offer sweetheart deals.
The measures I am announcing today will tackle the most common loopholes in international law, Moscovici insists. It should have a major impact in tackling aggressive tax planning.

Q: Won't these new rules penalise countries a long way from the centre of Europe, who might struggle to attract firms without an attractive corporation ?  ( Ireland, perhaps )

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) have decided to start investigations into certain former HBOS senior managers.

The move comes two months after an official report into the HBOS affair was finally published. 
It concluded that the decision to not investigate at least 10 former executives was "materially flawed". That list included chairman Lord Stevenson and chief executives Andy Hornby and James Crosby.
Potentially, the FCA and the PRA could decide to ban former HBOS top executives from working in the City.....

Britain's economy ended 2015 on a soft note after the annual pace of growth slowed to its weakest in nearly three years as the global economic slowdown weighed on its previously rapid expansion. 
Fourth-quarter gross domestic product grew by 0.5%, up slightly from 0.4% in the three months to September, the Office for National Statistics said on Thursday, and in line with economists' forecasts. 
Output in the three months to December was 1.9% higher than a year earlier, down from 2.1% in the third quarter and the smallest increase since early 2013. 
The figures are likely to ease worries that Britain is facing a sharp economic slowdown, as domestic demand appears to have remained resilient. But they suggest that the robust growth of the past two years will not return until the world economy regains strength.

 Gross domestic product is a blunt tool for assessing a country's economy. 
Although it measures activity within an economy, GDP doesn't assess the actual value of that work. Burning down a rainforest and building a new railway are seen in the same way.
And it doesn't measure inequality - whether the fruits of the economic success are shared fairly.
This message has finally filtered through to the global elite at Davos last week, where IMF chief Christine Lagarde called for a shake-up.
Lagarde told the World Economic Forum that:
"We have to go back to GDP, the calculation of productivity, the value of things - in order to assess, and probably change, the way we look at the economy."

 European markets are pretty calm this morning, as investors wait for the UK growth figures in 45 minutes time. 
The main indices are all up, a little, and oil is hovering around $33 per barrel.
But Conner Campbell of SpreadEx warns that Britain's GDP report could spoil the mood:
The upward movement from Brent Crude has caused a wave of green to overcome the UK index's crucial oil and mining stocks, in turn allowing the FTSE to flirt seriously with the 6000 mark for the first time in a fortnight.
However, a major spanner in the works could be thrown in if the day's first look at the UK's fourth quarter GDP disappoints. Analysts are expecting 0.5%, marginally better than the 0.4% seen back in Q3; yet there is more than a chance that the figure might underperform, with the Chinese slowdown, Brexit fears AND those weaker than hoped for Christmas retail sales all swirling around to potentially take a point or two off the reading.

 Corporate round-up  
Here's a round-up of today's other corporate news:
Transport company FirstGroup warned profits would come in lower than expected. It blamed the recent wet weather and flooding in Britain and driver shortages in the US.
Drinks giant Diageo, which makes Johnnie Walker scotch and Smirnoff vodka, reported a 1.8% rise in first-half sales. It took a hit from foreign exchange rates and the sale of assets, including its wine business.
Sweden's H&M has also been hit by the strong dollar, which drove up its purchasing costs (it buys most of its clothes in Asia in US dollars), and warned that big markdowns on winter wear will hurt its profit margins in the first quarter. Like rivals, the world's second-biggest fashion retailer pointed to the unusually warm weather in many part of Europe and north America, which put customers off buying winter clothes.
 Jimmy Choo had a good 2015, as Asian shoppers snapped up its luxury shoes. It said strong demand in Asia, especially Japan, had countered the loss of Russian visitors at its European stores and the impact of the Paris terrorist attacks. Retail net revenues grew by 9% at constant exchange rates to Â£208m, contributing to 7% growth in overall revenues to Â£318m.

But the price cut does not even come close to the drop in wholesale gas prices, consumer experts point out.
Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis, founder of www.cheapenergyclub.co.uk, said:
Baaaah. SSE has bleated and followed Eon's price cut last week, the rest of the big six sheep will likely soon follow. And again it's just a trivial 5% on gas only not electricity, nothing close to the drop in wholesale prices. Energy firms must be whooping for joy that they can get away with such small cuts and have the energy minister praising them, albeit slightly. Yet the real picture here is that even after cuts the vast majority of households in the UK are massively overpaying for their energy.
E.ON and SEE customers with typical usage on their standard tariffs will be paying at least Â£1,050, after the cuts, and those from other firms even more. Yet the market's cheapest tariffs for switchers are around Â£770 a year on the same usage. And indeed both E.ON and SSE offer these for those who bother to switch."

 SSE cuts gas prices by 5.3% from end March  
SSE, one of Britain's big six energy companies, will cut its domestic gas prices by an average of 5.3% - but not until after Easter. The company said:
This latest reduction will save a typical household gas customer on our standard tariff Â£32 a year compared with existing prices."
The move, which takes effect on 29 March, comes a week after rival E.On reduced its gas prices by 5.1% from 1 February.
SSE said it lost 300,000 customers in the first nine months of its financial year, as customers defected to smaller utility firms - part of a wider trend. Customer accounts dropped to 8.28m by 31 December. Even so, the company stuck to its full-year adjusted earnings per share target of 115p and said it would hike its dividend at least in line with retail price inflation.

 China and Brexit fears may hit growth  
Some economists fear that UK growth slowed to just 0.3% in the last quarter, due to economic problems overseas and political uncertainty back home.
Others predict a healthy pick-up in GDP.
My colleague Katie Allen explains:
Economists forecast that the figures will show growth of 0.5% in the final three months of 2015, slightly faster than growth of 0.4% in the previous quarter, according to the consensus in a Reuters poll.
But with worries about China's downturn and the wider global economy clouding the outlook, there is significant uncertainty over the UK's performance. Individual economists' forecasts range from 0.3% to 0.6%. Weak retail sales figures for the key Christmas season
There have also been warnings from businesses that the looming EU referendum is hurting confidence and forcing some firms to put investment plans on hold. With polls pointing to a tight vote, the pound has fallen sharply in recent weeks.

 Introduction: It's UK GDP Day  
Good morning.
We're about to find out how well, or badly, Britain's economy fared in the last three months of 2015.
Fresh GDP data for the October-December period is released at 9.30am. It will show how the UK performed during a time of growing worries about the global economy, and volatility in the markets.
Economists predict that the UK economy expanded by around 0.5% during the quarter. That would be a small improvement on the 0.4% growth posted in July-September, and fairly unremarkable compared with long-term averages.
But in the current climate, with China suffering a somewhat bumpy slowdown, any growth is better than nothing.
The figures have global significance; Britain is the first major advance economy to report fourth-quarter GDP data. 
As we covered in last night's blog, the US central bank has said it's watching the global economy and the markets closely.

Charity trustees are to blame for the fundraising scandal; 
Boards are accountable for their charities' actions and must ensure staff and contracted third-parties behave ethically towards beneficiaries and donors.

Bernard Jenkin.

The charity fundraising debacle of summer 2015 will scar the memories of many who run or work for charities. And so it should, but the purpose of the report published this week was not to find fault, rather advise on future steps. 
The public administration and constitutional affairs committee hopes that the lessons of last summer are learned and newly embedded in the culture of every charity that seeks extensive fundraising from the public. And there is only one group of people who can make sure of that in each case, and that is the trustees of those charities. 
Charities do an immense amount of valuable work, often with vulnerable people and they depend upon the generosity and trust of the public to ensure that they can continue essential work, but charitable ends can never justify uncharitable means.
 Related:  Are charities in denial about the true harm done by fundraising scandals?
Some people want to blame the failure of regulation. Yes, it can and will be improved. Some blame the Charity Commission. Some blame highly paid chief executives, or private contractors running call-centres, but think for a moment: who appointed them or approved their contracts? The harsh lesson is this - it is the trustees of those charities who were responsible for what was being done in their name. Trustees are charged with the good governance of their charity. Good governance has as much to with safeguarding the reputation of charities as much as anything else, for without a good reputation, no charity could achieve very much.
Trustees must adapt to meet this crisis. Trustees are responsible for appointing managers of charities, they are responsible for their charities' values and they are responsible for ensuring everyone behaves ethically towards their beneficiaries, employees and donors. 
The trustees of the charities we looked at were contrite but told us that they had not known what was being done in the name of the charity. As Karen Brown from Oxfam told us: "we have let down the general public insofar as those who are working in our name have acted in ways that are simply not acceptable."
The Direct Marketing Association told us that this was due to the fact trustees were ignorant of their obligations. Definitely we found that trustees had not been helped by a confused regulatory landscape and by the failure of the regulators to fully adopt guidance from the information commissioner about data. However, in the end trustees must be responsible for ensuring that their boards have the spectrum of skills and experience to manage their charity. 
A change of regulatory regime may clarify what trustees need to think about, and a more proactive attitude from the Information Commissioner would also be useful: but these things will have limited impact without a change in attitude and behaviour in the sector, and this starts with the attitudes and values promoted by trustees about every aspect of a charity's activity.
In the main, our report endorses the main Etherington review proposals for a new fundraising regulator, which should be accountable to the Charity Commission rather than to a select committee in parliament. We have neither the time nor the resources to carry out multiple inquiries into the sector. 
The trade bodies - ACEVO and NCVO - argue this risks undermining the new regulator's independence, but the NCVO's own review proposes that the commission act as a "backstop". The Charity Commission need not second-guess the new regulator, but merely hold it accountable. In this, there is no difference in principle between a select committee or the Charity Commission, except that the Charity Commission will give it more consistent attention.
The charitable sector is not a homogenous group. Most charities are very small and don't engage in telephone or public fundraising. Other charities are not regulated by the Charity Commission. They have their own unique characteristics - for example universities fundraise often from their alumni and have a unique relationship with them. It is important that the new regulatory structures cope with this diversity and that we don't overburden charities with regulation when they don't require it - as well as making sure that no future scandals happen.
The overall message is that the best way of creating a flexible system that works, is for trustees to be mindful constantly of their responsibilities. No system of regulation - statutory, non-statutory - can be a substitute for the judgement and integrity of trustees. It would be an unforgivable failure of the trustees of charities if statutory regulation becomes necessary.

'Speak up before there's nothing left': authors rally for National Libraries Day; 
A week of events tied to the nationwide celebration on 6 February is drawing support from writers and campaigners, as libraries face closure around the UK.

Alison Flood.

The bestselling children's author Philip Ardagh has called on book lovers to "speak up for libraries before there's nothing left to shout about", as writers and campaigners prepare for a week of events celebrating the UK's libraries in the build-up to National Libraries Day on Saturday 6 February.
The annual nationwide celebration of libraries is the latest move by campaigners to highlight the importance of a public service that is being hit by cuts up and down the country. Ann Cleeves, author of the bestselling Vera and Shetland crime series, has been named National Libraries Day ambassador and has urged people to go out and join their local library next week. 
We need libraries for democracy - there should be equal access to books, information and facts for everybody
  Ann Cleeves, National Libraries Day ambassador    
"Libraries matter. If we believe in equality of opportunity we must fight, not just for the buildings but for the range of books inside and the skilled staff who can promote reading in all its forms," said the novelist. "Not only do libraries encourage us to be more tolerant and better informed, they contribute enormously to the wealth of the nation."
Cleeves added that she "wouldn't be a writer without a library, and lots of authors will tell you the same thing". "They're magic places," she said. "And we need them for democracy - there should be equal access to books, information and facts for everybody."
Grubtown Tales author Philip Ardagh, who will be joining campaigners lobbying parliament on 9 February, called the local library "a port of call for books, local information, human contact, internet access, newspapers and magazines; a safe environment, a quiet environment, help with form-filling, advice, and the countless other little things that all add up to bigger things ... Speak up for libraries before there's nothing left to shout about." 
With more than 100 libraries closing in England, Wales and Scotland last year, local communities will be joined next week by authors and illustrators including Roger McGough and Nick Sharratt to celebrate the ones that remain. More than 400 events are planned for the week leading up to the main events on Saturday.
The celebration was originally called for by the children's author and campaigner Alan Gibbons, who said on Thursday that the public library service is in the middle of its worst ever crisis, with action "urgently needed to secure its future".
 Related:  Neil Gaiman: Libraries are cultural 'seed corn'
The event is run by organisations including the Chartered Institute of Library & Information Professionals and the Reading Agency. Cilip is also currently running a campaign, My Library By Right, calling on the government to "fulfil their statutory responsibilities to taxpayers" and keep libraries open. More than 11,000 people have signed its petition, supported by authors including Neil Gaiman and Joanna Trollope, asking the government to "take clear and decisive action in situations where services are being put at risk".
Authors will also come together on 9 February to join a lobby of parliament led by the Speak Up for Libraries group, calling on government to acknowledge the importance of public libraries. Speakers including Ardagh, Gibbons, crime author Jake Arnott and young adult author Cathy Cassidy will join a public rally at Central Hall, Westminster, with campaigners from around the country then planning to "descend on the Commons to lobby MPs to focus on the root cause of libraries' grim situation - apathy and ignorance in local and central government", said organisers.
"These people are fighting hard locally to keep libraries alive. They are desperate to show this is a major issue for the whole nation," said campaigner Laura Swaffield. "And it's not too late for others to join us."
 Related:  The loss of libraries is another surefire way to entrench inequality
Arnott, author of He Kills Coppers, said that "throughout our history, the library has proved to be the most effective and resilient memory system for our culture and civilisation. The public library creates a collective consciousness. Any attack on it simply adds to a social dementia."
Cassidy called the closure of libraries "a national scandal", and called on the public to "stand together against these closures, for the sake of our children and the future of our country".

McDonald's introduces chocolate-covered french fries to Japan; 
The American fast food giant is attempting to turn round its fortunes in Asia by adding the 'harmonious tasting' McChoco to its menu.

Justin McCurryin Tokyo.

McDonald's is attempting to reverse its sagging fortunes in Japan with the launch this week of a new menu item: french fries smothered in chocolate sauce. 
While the combination of deep-fried potato and sugary condiment is unlikely to impress dieticians, the fast-food chain's Japan unit is hoping the arrival of McChoco Potatoes will counteract a slew of bad news about its performance in the world's third-biggest economy.

While McDonald's reported a 5.7% rise in US in the last three months of 2015, as well as plans to open another 60 stores in Russia this year, its Japanese sales have been hit by a series of food scandals and supply issues.
In late 2014, the firm was forced to restrict sales of fries after industrial action at US ports affected shipments of thousands of tonnes of the chain's staple accompaniment to a burger to Japan.
Earlier the same year, officials in China closed down the firm's poultry supplier amid allegations that it had deliberately mixed fresh chicken with expired produce. 
Last year, its Japan operation was hit by reports of foreign objects -a piece of plastic and what appeared to be a human tooth - in McDonald's chicken nuggets and french fries.
McDonald's Japan, which operates almost 3,000 stores, reported a group net loss of â¢29 billion for the first nine months of 2015. It was expected to suffer a â¢38 billion ($318 million) net loss for the full year, with sales forecast to drop 10%. Last year, the firm said it would close about 130 stores in Japan and refurbish 2,000 others in the next four years.
The Nikkei business newspaper recently reported that the burger chain had reached out to investors about selling a part of its stake in its Japan business for 100 billion yen.
The sweet-and-salty fries, which come with two types of chocolate sauce - milk and white - cost 330 yen (2.77 US dollars), compared with 270 yen for a medium-sized portion of the regular version.
"Customers will find McChoco Potatoes enjoyable for different occasions, as it also makes for a great dessert. The combination creates a wonderful salty and sweet harmonious taste," the company said in a press release.
Early reviews suggest the combination, while perhaps not to everyone's taste, works surprisingly well. "Salt and chocolate complement each other quite well," Brian Ashcraft wrote on the Kotaku website.
"Since the fries are served hot, when you squirt on the sauce, the warm fries heat up the sauce. This causes the chocolate smell to become even stronger and more noticeable." 
Japanese consumers won't be able to indulge their sweet tooth for long, however: the chocolate fries will only be available until around mid-February, according to Rocket News.

News UK puts Rebekah Brooks' former defence lawyer in charge of legal; 
Company's chief executive hires Angus McBride, her counsel during phone-hacking trial, due to his 'wise advice and strategic approach'.

Jasper Jackson.

The lawyer who successfully defended Rebekah Brooks during her trial for phone hacking has been put in charge of legal at News UK, the company she returned to run as chief executive in September.  
Angus McBride, currently a partner at Kingsley Napley, will take over as general counsel for the publisher of the Times and the Sun from April. 
Brooks was acquitted in 2014 of all charges relating to phone hacking during her time as editor of the News of the World. 
Brooks said: "When I first spoke to Angus last autumn about joining us in this capacity, he was reluctant to give up the work that he loves. I am thrilled that he has decided to join us as he is always ten steps ahead and has a huge capacity to grasp quickly the full spectrum of issues. I have come to trust him implicitly and believe that News UK will benefit from his legal expertise, wise advice and strategic approach."
McBride said: "I am delighted to be joining News UK and look forward to working with its superb team of lawyers to provide legal advice and assistance throughout the company, and to Rebekah and the executive team.
"I hope that my 25 years in practice working at the cutting edge of high profile litigation will strengthen the team in confronting the ever more complex legal landscape the industry faces. I relish the challenge."
McBride's listing on the Kingsley Napley website describes him as having "extensive experience in high profile matters requiring press and reputational management". The site also lists his involvement on behalf of Gerry and Kate McCann in relation to the Portuguese criminal investigation following the abduction of their daughter, and in the cash for honours scandal.
McBride will replace current general counsel Emma Moloney, who is leaving at the end of this month.

London 2017 under threat after finance row between IAAF and UK Athletics; 
â Organising committee fears sport's crisis will affect sponsorship â World governing body believed to have asked for board to be reformed.

Owen Gibson.

There are fears that next summer's world championships could face a financial black hole amid an escalating behind-the-scenes row between the International Association of Athletics Federations and UK Athletics.
London 2017 has in recent weeks approached Sebastian Coe, the president of the crisis-hit governing body, for financial help amid fears that the negative headlines surrounding the sport have affected its ability to generate sponsorship income. But the organising committee is believed to have been told that, without reform of the London 2017 board, removing the UK Athletics chairman, Ed Warner, and chief executive, Niels de Vos, it is unlikely it could receive money from the world governing body.
At a time when Lord Coe is conducting a wide-ranging review of the IAAF's governance and internal controls in the wake of the deeply troubling corruption revelations involving his predecessor and a cabal of senior advisers, it is understood he has been advised by lawyers that it could not fund London 2017 without reform of the board's structure. 
The IAAF said the twin reviews were separate but members of the London 2017 board insist they have been told they are linked and there will not be financial help from the IAAF without governance changes.
"The IAAF can confirm that the London 2017 organising committee has asked for additional financial support and discussions are taking place," it said. "Separately a review of the corporate governance is under way as part of the ongoing IAAF reform programme."
The situation is further complicated by an internal row on the London 2017 board, with some board members believed to be concerned about the fact that Warner and De Vos sit on both the UKA board and the organising committee, and the lack of progress on sponsorship income.
There are also believed to be concerns in Whitehall and at City Hall over the governance arrangements. The government has underwritten the event financially. Last year Sainsbury's cut short its multi-million pound contract to sponsor British Athletics after Aviva ended its deal in 2012. In response, sources close to the UKA camp point out that it has not even begun looking for domestic sponsors and has successfully staged successive Anniversary Games in the Olympic Stadium.
First it must negotiate with Dentsu, the Japanese advertising giant that holds all the rights to the IAAF's major events until 2029, and pay an upfront fee in order to be able to sell the event to domestic sponsors.
But there is concern that the doping and corruption scandals outlined in a Wada-commissioned independent report overseen by Dick Pound will turn off potential sponsors, hence the approach to the IAAF.
Warner has repeatedly suggested that the London 2017 world championships could act as the first stage in the sport's re-emergence from its current malaise. But London 2017 sources believe the IAAF brand has become so toxic it should be dropped from the branding for the event.

Along with Warner, De Vos and the managing director, Sally Bolton, who joined the company after overseeing a successful Rugby League World Cup in 2013, the board also contains representatives from the Greater London Authority and UK Sport.
UK Sport's chief operating officer, Simon Morton, sits on the board to safeguard around Â£7m in Lottery money that was invested in the event as part of its remit to bring major events to the UK.
A board meeting on Friday was postponed and is set to take place in the coming weeks, where the matters are expected to come to a head.

Hospitals told to cut staff amid spiralling NHS cash crisis; 
Exclusive: Nurses' jobs threatened as regulators ditch policy brought in after Mid Staffs scandal of prioritising staff numbers.

Denis Campbell, Health policy editor.

Hospitals are being told to shed staff to rescue the NHS from an acute funding crisis, leaving nurses and other frontline medical workers at risk of the sack.
NHS regulators have taken the controversial decision despite intense concern among hospital bosses and health unions that reducing staff will hit quality of care, patient safety and staff morale, while increasing waiting times. 
Monitor and the NHS Trust Development Authority (TDA) have issued the instruction to reduce staffing almost three years after ministers ordered hospitals to do the opposite. They responded to the official report into the Mid Staffs care scandal by saying staffing levels must be increased in order to improve the standard of care.  
 Related:  This is the NHS - sign up to follow the project
Critics warn that, with some NHS trusts falling as much as Â£60m into the red, the move could lead to hospitals being forced to shed hundreds of staff in a bid to balance their books, with nurses and managers the most vulnerable to being axed. 
Addenbrooke's hospital in Cambridge, for example, has been losing Â£1.2m a week during 2015-16 and could end the year Â£60m in deficit. St George's hospital in south London is also expected to record a deficit of about Â£46.2m.
To save Â£1m, a trust would have to lose 25 nurses, according to the influential King's Fund thinktank. 
The regulators' decision to jettison the approach of the past three years of prioritising staffing levels ahead of financial rectitude has been prompted by the NHS's increasingly frantic efforts to tackle the spiralling deficit which hospitals in England are racking up, projected to be Â£2.2bn by the end of March. 
 Related:  Surgery in the womb: miracle maker for NHS's tiniest patients
Some of the hospital trusts that are most in the red have been told to use "headcount reduction" to reduce their deficit for 2015-16. 
The order is contained in a letter Monitor and the TDA sent on 15 January to every one of the 241 NHS trusts they supervise, which outlined the measures they needed to be taking to try and make their books balance. It told trusts to dramatically reduce their "financial distress" if they wanted to receive money from a Â£1.8bn bailout that becomes available in April and is aimed at finally stabilising NHS finances. 
The letter, signed by the TDA deputy chief executive, Bob Alexander, and his Monitor counterpart, Stephen Hay, says: "We will be meeting a number of challenged providers this month to agree a set of actions, including headcount reduction, additional to the current plan, with the clear intention of improving the financial position of those individual providers." 
The move prompted immediate warnings that patients would suffer. 
"If trusts do begin to reduce headcount the impact on patients would be swift, through either rising waiting times or reduced quality of care or both," said Richard Murray, the King's Fund's director of policy. "Three years on from Robert Francis's report into Mid Staffs, which emphasises that safe staffing was the key to maintaining quality of care, the financial meltdown in the NHS now means that the policy is being abandoned for hospitals that have run out of money." 
Labour's Heidi Alexander, the shadow health secretary, said: "At the last election, the Tories promised to ensure hospitals had enough staff to meet patient demand. However, less than a year later they're asking hospitals to draw up plans to reduce staff numbers." 
Howard Catton, the Royal College of Nursing's director of policy, said: "Patients will suffer without the right number of skilled and experienced frontline staff in place. Fewer staff dealing with more patients will only lead to longer and completely preventable hospital stays, and patients will feel the impact of not having the right number of skilled and experienced frontline staff in place." 
Almost all of the foundation trust hospitals regulated by Monitor - which are semi-independent of NHS control - are deemed to be financially "challenged" and 26 of them have overspent by so much that they are receiving bailouts from the Department of Health to help pay their bills. The spiralling cost of employing expensive agency staff, which is set to cost the NHS Â£4bn this year, is the single biggest reason for the Â£2.2bn overspend.

In a further letter Monitor and the TDA sent on 22 January trusts were also advised to save money by extending the life of "plant, machinery and equipment" wherever possible. This raises the prospect of key equipment such as CT and MRI scanners, used to identify cancer, infections and broken bones, continuing to be used beyond the expected end of their working lives. 
The chief executive of one of England's biggest trusts, speaking anonymously, said the drive to reduce staff numbers was reckless and counterproductive. 
The chief executive said: "They are signalling fewer people working for the NHS. What they don't seem to appreciate is that it's hands-on business and you need the hands on. If we aren't careful we will be driving the NHS off a crisis cliff. The reality is that there isn't enough money going into the NHS for it to do its job properly." 
A Department of Health spokesman said: "We expect all parts of the NHS to have safe staffing levels - making sure they have the right staff, in the right place, at the right time." He said the NHS now employed 6,100 fewer managers and almost 30,000 more clinical staff than in 2010.

London 2017 under threat after finance row between IAAF and UK Athletics; 
â Organising committee fears sport's crisis will affect sponsorship â Reports suggest world governing body has asked for board to be reformed.

Owen Gibson.

There are fears that next summer's world athletics championships could face a financial black hole amid an escalating behind-the-scenes row between the International Association of Athletics Federations and UK Athletics.
London 2017 has in recent weeks approached Sebastian Coe, the president of the crisis-hit governing body, for financial help amid fears that the negative headlines surrounding the sport have affected its ability to generate sponsorship income. But the organising committee is believed to have been told that without reform of the London 2017 board, removing the UK Athletics chairman Ed Warner and chief executive Niels de Vos, it is unlikely it could receive money from the world governing body.
At a time when Lord Coe is conducting a wide ranging review of the IAAF's governance and internal controls in the wake of the deeply troubling corruption revelations involving his predecessor and a cabal of senior advisers, it is understood he has been advised by lawyers that it could not fund London 2017 without reform of the board's structure. 
The IAAF said the twin reviews were separate but members of the London 2017 board insist they have been told they are linked and there will not be financial help from the IAAF without governance changes.
"The IAAF can confirm that the London 2017 organising committee has asked for additional financial support and discussions are taking place," it said. "Separately, a review of the corporate governance is underway as part of the ongoing IAAF reform programme."
The situation is further complicated by an internal row on the London 2017 board, with some board members believed to be concerned about the fact that Warner and De Vos sit on both the UKA board and the organising committee, and the lack of progress on sponsorship income.
There are also believed to be concerns in Whitehall and at City Hall over the governance arrangements. The government has underwritten the event financially. Last year, Sainsbury's cut short its multi-million pound contract to sponsor British Athletics after Aviva ended its deal in 2012. In response, sources close to the UKA camp point out that it has not even begun looking for domestic sponsors and has successfully staged successive Anniversary Games in the Olympic Stadium.
First it must negotiate with Dentsu, the Japanese advertising giant that holds all the rights to the IAAF's major events until 2029, and pay an upfront fee in order to be able to sell the event to domestic sponsors.
But there is concern that the doping and corruption scandals outlined in a Wada-commissioned independent report overseen by Dick Pound will turn off potential sponsors - hence the approach to the IAAF.
Warner has repeatedly suggested that the London 2017 world championships could act as the first stage in the sport's re-emergence from its current malaise. But London 2017 sources believe the IAAF brand has become so toxic it should be dropped from the branding for the event.

Along with Warner, De Vos and managing director Sally Bolton, who joined the company after overseeing a successful Rugby League World Cup in 2013, the board also contains representatives from the GLA and UK Sport.
UK Sport's chief operating officer Simon Morton sits on the board to safeguard around Â£7m in Lottery money that was invested in the event as part of its remit to bring major events to the UK.
A board meeting Friday was postponed and is set to take place in the coming weeks, where the matters are expected to come to a head.

James Murdoch: has the heir apparent changed more than his look?; 
His departure from Sky in 2012 led to suggestions that his chances of inheriting control of the family empire had been damaged - but now he's back.

Graham Ruddick.

The short-back-and-sides haircut has been replaced by a sophisticated side-parting and the thin-rimmed glasses have been replaced by more fashionable thick black frames, but it really is James Murdoch returning to Sky as chairman.
Whether Murdoch has changed more than his appearance since quitting as Sky chairman in 2012 at the height of the phone-hacking saga will be a key concern of investors in the company. 
He resigned from the role in April 2012 as Ofcom, the industry regulator, conducted an investigation into whether Sky was fit and proper to hold a broadcasting licence. The inquiry was launched as a result of the phone-hacking scandal at the Sun, which was owned by the Murdochs' News International.
The investigation cleared Sky but castigated Murdoch, stating that he "repeatedly fell short of the conduct to be expected of him as a chief executive officer and chairman". Murdoch's departure led to predictions that his chances of inheriting control of the family empire had been severely damaged. But now he's back. 
James, the youngest of Rupert Murdoch's two sons, was not exactly cast into the wilderness after stepping down as chairman of Sky and executive chairman of News International in 2012. He kept a seat on the board of Sky as a non-executive director and retained his title as deputy chief operating officer of News Corporation, the parent company of News International and the owner of a 39% stake in Sky.
Now based in New York, Murdoch played a key role in helping to split the family's news and entertainment businesses into two separate companies, News Corp and 21st Century Fox. 
However, Murdoch's comeback from the phone-hacking scandal was really kick-started when he was promoted to co-chief operating officer of 21st Century Fox in 2014. He had previously been the deputy chief operating officer and head of international.
The appointment was a clear signal that Rupert was preparing to hand over control of his empire to his sons, Lachlan and James. James's return was sealed when he was named chief executive of Fox last year, just three years after he quit his role at Sky.
Murdoch's rise to the top of Fox prompted rumours of discord within the company, but he has said he does not pay attention to the criticism. "You don't want to get into a position where you're obsessing over what people are saying - is this fair, is that unfair, etc - because people are going to write what they are going to write," he said in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter.
Now one of the most powerful men in Hollywood, Murdoch has changed his look and insists he has learned from the hacking scandal. "Every professional experience you learn a lot from," he said last year. "You learn about yourself, you learn about the company, you learn about people's interests around the place. In a situation like that, you learn a lot about politics. It was a very intense period, but you know, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger."
Murdoch has been used to criticism and allegations of nepotism ever since he was named chief executive of British Sky Broadcasting at the tender age of just 30, back in 2003, when Rupert was still chairman.
That move provided "clear evidence for a pretty serious review of the corporate governance practices in the company," said the Association of British Insurers, which represented big investors at the time.
But his four years as Sky's boss were regarded as successful. Murdoch was credited with significantly growing Sky's subscriber numbers and expanding the company into broadband. He was then promoted from chief executive to chairman - another move shareholders generally dislike - and served in the role between 2007 and 2012.
Murdoch was born in Wimbledon, London, in 1972, three years after Rupert Murdoch arrived on Fleet Street by buying the News of the World. He has dual US and British citizenship and three children with his wife, Kathryn. 
He went to school in New York before getting a place at Harvard University, but at one time gained a  reputation as the rebel of the family after getting piercings and tattoos and dropping out of Harvard after just three terms.
After Harvard, Murdoch helped to create a hip-hop record label called Rawkus Records, which was eventually bought by his father. That marked the start of James's career in the family business, and after stints in charge of News Corp's music and internet strategy and the Asian television service Star TV, he was named the boss of Sky.
Despite the hacking scandal and his past status as a rebel, he has always been backed by his father, so it is arguably not a surprise that James has now returned to the top job at Sky.
"Everyone talks about hacking in London. That all happened long before James took charge," Rupert Murdoch told Fortune last year.
"He took Star television and [made it] the number one broadcaster in India, with about eight channels, and is making a big difference to that country. Then he went to BSkyB, where people said, 'Oh, that must be nepotism.'
"But in fact, he went through a lot of tests, and when we took him out of his day-to-day role there and made him chairman, the same shareholders complained and said we can't lose him. 
"He completely changed BSkyB and lifted the bar there in every way - and added huge value to News Corp."

In the Murdoch morality tale, Rupert always wins; 
The latest twist in an extraordinary saga of corporate rehabilitation suggests that the indignities of the phone-hacking trials and Leveson are clearly in the past.

Joan Smith.

It's the news they couldn't wait to announce: James Murdoch has been reappointed chairman of Sky TV, proving beyond doubt that one of the world's most powerful dynasties has got its mojo back. The news comes in a stunning month for the Murdoch clan, following swiftly on the announcement that James's father Rupert is engaged to the former model Jerry Hall.
 Related:  James Murdoch returns as Sky chairman 
It's a far cry from the dark days of 2012, when Murdoch's younger son stepped down from his job running Sky in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal. James had been chairman and chief executive of News Corp, the parent company of News international, during a period when intercepting mobile phone calls - including mine - was rife at the News of the World.
After the Murdochs gave evidence to a parliamentary committee investigating the hacking, MPs accused News Corp of "wilful blindness" and said its directors, including James and Rupert Murdoch, "should ultimately be prepared to take responsibility".
Almost four years later, James Murdoch was the only candidate put forward to the Sky board. His appointment as chairman was announced by Sky's chief executive, Jeremy Darroch, during a conference call with the media, despite the fact that it's hard to think of a more insensitive moment to reveal Murdoch's return. This week, the family of Milly Dowler, the murdered schoolgirl at the heart of the phone-hacking scandal, had to deal with the distressing news that Levi Bellfield had finally confessed to the abduction, rape and murder of 13-year-old Milly in 2002.
Her parents, who gave evidence at the Leveson inquiry, said in a statement that the news of Bellfield's confession was "devastating for a family that already had to endure so much". It was the Guardian's revelation that Milly's phone had been hacked by someone acting on behalf of the News of the World that led to calls for a public inquiry in the summer of 2011.
For the Murdochs, it seems phone hacking and all the scandals that went with it are clearly in the past. Those awful days when James and Rupert had to appear penitent, shaking their heads over the failure of minions who inexplicably withheld crucial information from them, must feel like a bad dream. It's not even as if James is the only one who's got his job back: Rebekah Brooks was reinstated  as chief executive of Murdoch's British publishing business, News UK, in September last year.
All that embarrassment about the close links between Murdoch's senior people and David Cameron - who now remembers her text offering a " country supper "? - is ancient history. Next time the Murdochs gather en masse, they could raise a glass not just to Rupert's impending nuptials but one of the most successful PR strategies in living memory. The resignations, the displays of contrition, Rupert's dramatic announcement about the "humblest day" of his life: they were what was expected and they were what we got. We should have known it wouldn't last.

Those of us who had believed for years that the press was too powerful, concentrated in the hands of a tiny group of tycoons with the power to make or break governments, thought that the day of reckoning had finally come. How could any organisation survive the sordid revelations that emerged at the Leveson inquiry, costing the Murdoch empire millions in compensation and legal fees, along with the closure of a flagship title?
That's why so many people who had suffered from intrusion were willing to appear before Leveson. Giving evidence about very personal matters is daunting, and most of us did it because we believed in the possibility of change. Now it feels as if we were hopelessly optimistic, failing to realise that the inquiry would be undermined by a process of attrition and a lack of political will. I still think it was worth it, but it's hard to believe that so little has come out of a scandal that caused so much distress to so many people.
James Murdoch himself told us that the bad old days were over. Under questioning from the Leveson inquiry's softly spoken interrogator, Robert Jay QC, he rejected the idea that power lay with the media during an election campaign. "I just don't think that there's that kind of old-fashioned power of big media proprietors being able to dominate the landscape," he insisted.
Subsequent events tell a different story. Those politicians who tried to hold the Murdochs and other press barons to account have all but disappeared from view. The prime minister, who was bounced into setting up the inquiry by Labour's Ed Miliband and the Lib Dems' Nick Clegg, now has a parliamentary majority and doesn't need to worry about an enfeebled opposition.
Along with George Osborne, Cameron headed the guest list at Rupert's Christmas party in London last month, where they were joined by half the cabinet. Sometimes I can't help but wonder who - Cameron or Murdoch - actually won the 2015 election.
Normal service has been resumed, in other words. In that sense, James Murdoch's return to Sky is the final act in an extraordinary saga of corporate rehabilitation. It's a morality play of sorts and one title fits: how are the mighty risen.

James Murdoch's return as Sky chair is a major concern, says investor; 
Shareholder claims new role flouts corporate governance code and is a serious conflict of interest because he runs its biggest shareholder, Fox.

Mark Sweney.

A Sky shareholder has criticised James Murdoch's appointment as chairman, arguing that it flouts the corporate governance code and is a serious conflict of interest given he runs its biggest shareholder, Fox.
Royal London Asset Management, which owns Â£50m of Sky shares, believes Murdoch's reappointment is "inappropriate".
He was forced to stand down  as chairman of Sky in 2012 in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal at News International, publisher of the Sun, Times and now defunct News of the World, where he had held the role of chairman.  
 Related:  James Murdoch returns as Sky chairman
Broadcasting regulator Ofcom heavily criticised Murdoch's conduct in handling the scandal, saying it "repeatedly fell short" of what was expected of a chairman.
The Commons culture select committee, which was then chaired by current culture secretary John Whittingdale, also weighed in, concluding that Murdoch showed "wilful ignorance" of phone hacking. 
"It is just four years since Ofcom and the culture, media and sport committee - which was then chaired by the current secretary of state - all raised serious and well-founded concerns about James Murdoch's lamentable handling of the phone-hacking scandal and his failure to take action over it," said the shadow culture secretrary, Maria Eagle. 
"Since then he has failed to rebut the many serious criticisms that have been raised over his conduct on phone hacking. So it is no wonder that some are already questioning the impact this will have on the independence of Sky's board, with what is being seen as the firing of the starting gun for a fresh takeover attempt of the company."
Murdoch, a non-executive director at Sky, was the only candidate put forward by its nominations committee, which is led by outgoing chairman Nick Ferguson.
The three-man committee also included Aberdeen Asset Management chief executive Martin Gilbert, who has been promoted to Sky deputy chairman, and independent director Dave Lewis, chief executive of Tesco. 
Murdoch was then unanimously voted chairman by his 11 fellow board members, six of whom are independent directors.
Ashley Hamilton Claxton, corporate governance manager at RLAM, said the process raises questions over how Murdoch was appointed.
"His appointment is a major concern because the chairman should be independent. And particularly so in this case as Fox is such a significant shareholder that has shown an interest in taking over the company. It is surprising the board has chosen to elevate him to the level of chairman again."
She points to the major issue that his appointment breaks best practice of the UK corporate governance code, which states that a chairman should be independent.
Murdoch is the chief executive of 21st Century Fox, which controls Sky as the biggest single shareholder with a 39.6% stake.
Fox was forced to give up on an Â£8bn-plus bid t o take full control of Sky in 2011 as the fallout from the phone-hacking scandal made it too politically difficult to complete. 
"Should Fox make a bid for Sky, investors need a strong independent chairman to protect the interests of minority shareholders," says Hamilton Claxton. "If there was a situation where a vote was tied we question what extent the chairman will act in the best interests of all shareholders, he is conflicted."
However, the UK corporate governance code is not legally binding. Companies only have to "comply or explain", so Sky was able to ignore the best practice on the independence of the chairman.
Sky also decided against informing or consulting shareholders about the appointment, although there is no legal corporate governance requirement to do so.
"In this day and age of stewardship and promoting better understanding between companies and shareholders it is very unhelpful [not communicating with investors]," said Sarah Wilson, the chief executive of shareholder advisory firm Manifest. 
"The key issue here is that independent board oversight is going to be crucial because of what some people see as a toxic combination of past problems and the lack of a transparent process. Was there even a search process?" 
Sky defended Murdoch's promotion, pointing out that it has made two strong appointments for balance: Gilbert as his deputy and Andrew Sukawaty, who takes over his role as Sky's senior independent director.
"We have a strong board including six independent directors, including the deputy chairman and senior independent director appointed today," said a spokesman for Sky. "The board is used to operating with a large shareholder and has robust processes in place."
However, one observer argues that a number of Sky's directors, such as Gilbert and Lewis, may not be able to give their full focus to Sky because of dealing with major problems at their own businesses.
"Are they going to have the time to properly do their job at Sky, which is crucial with James not being an independent chairman?," said the City source. "Both are not just chief executives of FTSE 100 companies, they are at organisations facing challenging conditions. I wouldn't be surprised if other investors call for a board refreshment, fresh independent directors, given this major change." 
In the almost four years since Murdoch moved into a non-executive directorship there has never been a revolt by investors voting against his reappointment at each annual general meeting.
"In no normal company, with proper regard to standards of corporate governance, would the board appoint someone under whose management between 2007 and 2012 News International engaged in a cover-up of the extent of phone hacking, and by his failures to prevent it cost the company over Â£500m so far," said Evan Harris, joint executive director of the campaigning group Hacked Off. 
Outgoing chairman Ferguson was paid total remuneration of Â£473,934. Sky would not comment on what change Murdoch can expect to his Â£96,500 remuneration as a non-executive director.
"Yet again Rupert Murdoch shows callous disregard for British public opinion," said Chris Bryant, the former shadow culture secretary. "James Murdoch's only defence was incompetence over phone hacking and now he's back."

Does James Murdoch's return herald a fresh Â£14bn bid for full control of Sky?; 
Rupert Murdoch's younger son may see Fox taking full control of the pay-TV group as 'unfinished business' after it was forced to abandon a bid five years ago.

Mark Sweney.

                     James Murdoch's surprise return as Sky chairman has immediately sparked renewed speculation that Fox will mount a Â£14bn takeover bid.
Fox was forced to give up a then Â£8bn-plus bid to take control of the 61% of Sky it does not already own in 2011, as the fallout from the phone-hacking scandal made sealing a deal impossible. 
Murdoch took the post of chief executive at Sky in 2003 at the tender age of 30. Following a successful tenure, he was forced to stand down as chairman in 2012, after Ofcom and the Commons culture select committee criticised his handling of the phone-hacking scandal when he was chairman of News International, which publishes the Sun, Times and now defunct news of the World.  
 Related:  James Murdoch returns as Sky chairman
Many in the City believe that Murdoch will see a renewed bid as "unfinished business".
Following his resignation, Murdoch may have retreated to Fox in the US - where he was promoted to chief executive in June - but he kept a firm eye on developments at Sky.
Murdoch was a key figure in the move to make Sky a pan-European pay-TV giant in a Â£6.88bn deal to buy out its sister operations in Germany and Italy.
Late last year Murdoch made it clear that Fox will either buy, or sell, its stake in Sky when he said that not having complete control "is not an end state that is natural for us".
But a renewed bid would now be significantly more costly than when Fox was looking at just acquiring Sky UK in 2011 when it had a price tag of about Â£8bn.
The pan-European Sky now has a market capitalisation of Â£18bn, with the 60% that Fox doesn't own worth just short of Â£11bn.
City sources say that a takeover bid would see Fox have to pay probably a 20% to 30% premium which would mean a deal valued at about Â£14bn, excluding debt.
"He is coming back to lead the company in European form in an era when consolidation may well happen in both Europe and the US," said Claire Enders of Enders Analysis. "If it does happen European consolidation is vital for Sky to navigate and from a business perspective James's return is extraordinarily good news."
Any new bid by Fox would be unlikely to run into competition issues; the European Commission unconditionally approved the original bid.
However, in order to satisfy potential issues over British media dominance - the Murdoch family also controls Sun and Times publisher News UK - a spin-off of the loss-making Sky News may have to be considered, as it was at the time of the original bid. 
If Fox were to make a renewed bid for full control of Sky, Murdoch would have to step aside from the process.
It would be run by his new deputy Martin Gilbert, the chief executive of Aberdeen Asset Management who was senior independent director at Sky.
Murdoch has poured cold water on any near-term move by Fox, saying that there are "no plans on the agenda right now".
Some observers believe that James Murdoch is unlikely to want to wade back into a highly politicised takeover battle, and that Sky is facing issues including spiralling rights costs for sports including Premier League football.
An alternative interpretation of Murdoch's comments about Fox's stake in Sky is that it will look to sell up.
The creation of Sky Europe saw Fox sell off its stakes in Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland to the Sky UK business.
It has been speculated that Fox might look instead at a target such as a Viacom, the owner of MTV and Channel 5 in the UK, which is ailing as its 92-year old founder Sumner Redstone suffers from ill health.
In August 2014, Fox scrapped an audacious $80bn bid to take over Time Warner, a move that would have created a media behemoth and would have been seen as the crowning deal of Rupert Murdoch's career.
"The big show is in the US," said Enders. "His appointment does not directly signal an intention [that Fox will buy Sky]. What is obvious is that the old [Rupert] Murdoch habit of having a chairman of every major entity is possible again [post phone hacking]. It is where things would have been anyway if the business of the last four years had not occurred."

New play brings undercover spy scandal to the stage; 
The new drama explores how undercover policemen were sent to spy on political groups and deceived women into forming intimate relationships.

Rob Evans.

A new play about undercover policemen and the pain they have inflicted on women is due to open next week. 
"Any Means Necessary" is based on the true story of the police's long-running covert infiltration of political groups.  
The play looks at how the undercover officers deceived women into forming long-term relationships with them during their covert missions. It also shows how the women turned the tables and searched for the truth about the men's deception. 
The drama is based on the exposure of Mark Kennedy, the undercover policeman who infiltrated environmental groups, and the collapse of the prosecution of campaigners after it was revealed that crucial evidence had been concealed by the state.
The play is due to run between February 5 and 20 at the Nottingham Playhouse. Nottingham was where Kennedy spied on campaigners during his secret mission. 
Writer Kefi Chadwick has talked to many of those who have been involved in the controversy about undercover policing. They include Alison, who had a five-year relationship with undercover police officer Mark Jenner (for background, read this ). 
Chadwick said: "These cases show an incredible abuse of human rights and civil liberties and are one of the biggest police scandals of all time." She told the Sunday Times :"This is a story about women who were abused by the state, but have taken that power back to bring the people concerned to account. I didn't want to write a play about victims. I am sick of seeing women as victims, on screen dead, or sex trafficked or raped... those stories are valid, but this is about bringing the people who've done that wrong to you into the light."
 Related:  Undercover policemen, undercover lovers
Publicity for the play can be found here and here. The text of her drama is due to be published as a book next month. 
The title of the play "Any Means Necessary" is drawn from the unofficial motto of the Special Demonstration Squad, one of the undercover units at the heart of the controversy.
There will be a series of meetings connected to the play that will be held at the Nottingham Playhouse.
On February 11, Helen Steel (one of the defendants in the long-running Mclibel trial) will talk about how undercover policeman John Dines deceived her during a two-year relationship. She will be joined by Bruce Kent, vice-president of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, who will talk about how a spy infiltrated CND. ( More details here ). 
On February 13, Donal O'Driscoll of the Undercover Research Group (a network of activists who are investigating the police's covert infiltration of political groups) will speak about their work. ( More details here ). The group is also holding a series of roundtable meetings around the country about unmasking police spies - see this here for more information. 
On February 17, Chadwick and Merrick Badger, one of the activists who helped unmask Kennedy, will discuss the spy scandal. (Details are here ).

David Hare: how I learned to love adaptation; 
Ibsen wanted his plays to be continually updated after his death. As his new version of The Master Builder opens, Hare reflects on the pain and pleasure of adaptation - and what he learned piecing Chekhov together in his garage.

David Hare.

Soon after becoming a playwright, I resolved to have nothing to do with adaptation. There were two reasons. First, I wasn't any good at it. My early version of Pirandello 's The Rules of the Game, written when I was 23, and performed by Paul Scofield and Joan Plowright for the National Theatre, decisively proved that I knew nothing about Pirandello and still less about adaptation: it was inept. But I had also gone into it with a puritanical belief that dramatists should write their own plays, not hitch a free ride by adapting other people's. Nothing in the world was harder than telling a new story. Reconfiguring old ones was going to be far less important work.
Ibsen didn't seem to mind that audiences might talk as much about his peculiar psyche as they do about his hero's 
This belief held good until 1991 when Jonathan Kent, at the start of his shared artistic directorship of the Almeida theatre, asked me whether he could restage the Pirandello. Reading it again after nearly 20 years made me feel so ashamed that I offered, for free, to entirely redo it rather than allow my youthful incompetence to be displayed again. The authority of the result owed a great deal to Richard Griffiths 's elegant, lethal performance as the jealous hero, Leone. But, spurred on by Jonathan, I then felt ready to tackle Brecht and Chekhov. The Almeida's overall mission to rediscover and reinterpret the European repertory resulted in some of the best theatre-going of my life, and I was proud to be a small part of its realisation. In 1998 Sam Mendes moved me on to think about a free modernisation of Reigen  AKA La Ronde, which eventually emerged as a big Broadway scandal called The Blue Room. To everyone's surprise, the play was splashed over the entire front page of New York Daily News, an unexpected place to find Arthur Schnitzler. Howard Davies then asked for Lorca, and in 2006 Michael Attenborough encouraged me to try Gorky.
Affinity with some authors, even with some plays, was easier than with others. You never know till you start. The first five pages are always agony, often taking as long as the next 50. Last summer, when seeking to animate the plays of young Chekhov for the Chichester festival theatre, I for once slipped straight away into an idiom that seemed appropriate and supple. Platonov was so clearly about the reckless dazzle of youth, Ivanov about its passing, and The Seagull about the determination of the middle-aged to destroy the hopes of the young, that a shared, subtly modern rhetoric suggested itself unforced for all three plays. In the case of The Seagull, which is, quite simply, a perfectly written play, I was able to work at ridiculous speed. But with Lorca's The House of Bernarda Alba I always felt a long way off the pace, grasping hopelessly for a surrealist tone that was beyond my reach.
Although his family were flattering about the result, Lorca's distinctive approach seemed to need Pedro AlmodÃvar more than it needed me. Brecht's Life of Galileo, with its implication that an individual can change history, was a breeze. But his Mother Courage, arguing the exact opposite, and full of what German speakers optimistically describe as "Bavarian humour" was depressing and intractable, a tough play to work on and an even tougher one to get right. Tonya Pinkins 's withdrawal earlier this month from a prominent Mother Courage in New York after a couple of previews because she could not agree an interpretation of the central role with the director did not surprise me in the least. It's that kind of play.
Whatever the success of the individual outcome, sustained exposure to the skills and techniques of other playwrights was always pleasurable. I would lay the pieces out on the garage floor and think, "Oh, so that's how they do it". It wasn't coincidence that I took to adaptation in the theatre at exactly the same time that I gave up directing. My best way of describing stage adaptation is "direction by proxy". It's not that you do the director's job for them - far from it - but essentially, as you adapt, you do create a little production in your head. When you work with a great director, you notice that what they are doing is effectively tuning the play to the audience's understanding. It is like turning a lens to crisp focus. The great ones mediate the experience between the stage and the auditorium, so that everything - light, sound, image, rhythm - helps to reveal to the onlooker exactly what it is they are watching.
When remaking a classic, the adapter aims to judiciously choose which aspects of the literal translation to emphasise and which to downplay. There can never be any such thing as a word-for-word faithful translation, or if there were, it would be dreary and academic. No one tongue perfectly parallels another. Nuances abundant in a word in one language are entirely absent in another. For that reason fluency in the original language may well be a huge bonus in theatrical transposition - in Michael Frayn 's Chekhov or Michael Meyer's Ibsen, clearly it is - but it is not essential. My job is to pitch a play so that the resonances intended by the play of words in one tongue seem still to be sparking in an entirely different time and culture.
                     Ibsen came to the very same conclusion when he insisted that if his plays survived after his death, they would need to be revised constantly for foreign production. He didn't believe any one translation could ever become standard. Ibsen requested the plays always be presented in what he called "the everyday speech of the time", and, by definition, he expected that speech to change. It was Ralph Fiennes, a fellow graduate of the Almeida of the 1990s, who came to me asking to play the part of Halvard Solness, because he had reached that stage in his life when only the most challenging texts attracted him. It seemed appropriate to the play's dizzying abstraction that Matthew Warchus 's production is international, with Sarah Snook coming from Australia to play Hilde and Linda Emond, the consummate player of Arthur Miller and of Tony Kushner, coming from New York to play Aline.

                     The Master Builder, as it happens, is an especially demanding text because it moves almost everywhere between the everyday and the sublime. It is a play that changes its apparent subject more times than any I can think of. Just when, as an audience, you settle on one meaning and think, "So that's what he's getting at", Ibsen flips the action and takes you off on a different course entirely. The timing with which he judges these switches is immaculate. At curtain-up, Ibsen appears to be offering a realistic portrait of an architect who fears that the young will come knocking at the door to challenge his professional supremacy. But by the time he and the young woman, Hilde, are arguing about events that may or may not have happened in another town 10 years previously, and both invoking demons and trolls to explain their behaviour, the play is moving into far slippier territory. As a tragic subtext about past events between the architect and his wife Aline begins to take hold, there is a fractured quality in the Norwegian dialogue. The play is full of broken speech, as if words are being spoken, unbidden, from their subconscious. Finding a style for this technique of deliberate hint, block and allusion is the main challenge for any version of The Master Builder.
Clearly, there is a strong autobiographical element in the portrait of an artist who, when he loses faith in God, gives up designing sacred buildings and chooses instead to make domestic ones - only to find making homes equally unsatisfactory. Anyone who has followed Ibsen's journey from his early poetic dramas to his increasing interest in the realistic will realise that an old man's obsession with the young, and in particular the sexual young, is not the only obvious parallel between the ageing author of The Master Builder and its hero, Solness. There are moments in the play when the author seems to be drawing attention to his own predicaments, as though he did not mind that audiences might walk away from the theatre talking as much about his peculiar psychology as they do about his hero's.
This is a play working at many different levels - the mythic, the psychological and the subconscious. It has been open to countless interpretations, not least by those who believe that the entire story is taking place in the central character's head. Like many great plays, it flirts with madness. But, throughout, the disparate elements are held together by the strong musical grip of the action. Ibsen was, above all, a musical writer: he aimed for a theatre that in its formal movement would closely resemble music. He wanted emotional power and human detail, but, more than anything, he wanted shape. That is why he is such a joy to adapt.
â The Master Builder is at the Old Vic, London SE1, from 23 January to 19 March.

James Murdoch returns as Sky chairman; 
Rupert Murdoch's younger son stepped down from the pay-TV group in 2012 in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal.

Mark Sweney.

James Murdoch is to return to Sky as chairman, almost four years after he was forced to stand down in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal.
Murdoch, who was chief executive and then chairman from 2003 to 2012, stepped down from the then BSkyB because of the fallout from the phone hacking scandal at News International, publisher of the Sun, Times and now defunct News of the World, where he held the role of chairman.
At the time Murdoch said he felt it right to stand down as chairman of Sky - which is 39.6% owned by Rupert Murdoch's Fox- to avoid becoming a "lightning rod" for criticism of Sky because of his association with the phone-hacking scandal. 
 Related:  James Murdoch's return as Sky chair is a major concern, says investor
Murdoch, who remained a Sky non-executive director after stepping down as chairman, replaces Nick Ferguson who is leaving the company after 12 years. 
"I would like to thank Nick for his outstanding contribution to the board over the last decade and more. I am proud to have been asked by the board to serve as chairman of Sky, one of the world's leading pay TV companies," said Murdoch. 
"Jeremy and the team at Sky have done an outstanding job in building a dynamic and successful company. As chairman, I look forward to working with the board and management as they continue to deliver a great service for Sky's customers and create value for all shareholders over the years to come." 
The Sky chief executive, Jeremy Darroch, brushed off any assertion that Murdoch should not be Sky chairman.
"Without a doubt he is the right man for the job," he said, in a conference call with media on Friday morning. 
Murdoch was the sole candidate put forward to Sky's board by the nominations committee. 
"The board was unanimous in support of James. At the time he stepped aside he felt was putting interests of the company ahead of his own. [Since then] he has been consistently re-elected by shareholders [as a non-executive director]. It was a smooth process and got to a good outcome. His knowledge of the international media industry will be a big asset." 
Thomas Singlehurst, an analyst at Citi, said that Murdoch's appointment "may raise some questions about the balance of the board between independents/non-independents".
James Murdoch's handling of the phone-hacking scandal came under fire from MPs and others.
Broadcasting regulator Ofcom, which ruled Sky was a fit and proper broadcaster to hold a licence following an investigation prompted by the phone-hacking scandal, heavily criticised Murdoch.
Ofcom said Murdoch's conduct in handling of the hacking scandal "repeatedly fell short" of that expected of the chief executive and chairman at News International. 
The regulator criticised his "failure" to take action, which Ofcom said was "difficult to comprehend and ill-judged". 
James's return marks the latest stage of a remarkable reassertion of power by Rupert Murdoch over his UK and European media assets. 
In September, News Corp confirmed the return of Rebekah Brooks as chief executive of News UK, a year after she was cleared of all charges related to the phone-hacking scandal.  
The return of James Murdoch will further ignite rumours that Fox, where he holds the role of chief executive, may look to mount another bid to take full control of Sky.
Fox was forced to give up on an Â£8bn-plus bid to take full control of Sky UK in 2011.
In October, James Murdoch hinted at ownership change at Sky, now a pan-European operator after taking full control of Sky in Germany and Italy, when he said that not having complete control of Sky "is not an end state that is natural for us". 
Darroch said on Friday: "I think that from time time there is speculation about what Fox's intentions are. As management we don't get distracted by that. I can't speak for Fox but [James] and they continue to be passionate supporters for Sky's ongoing success. Our job is to keep building a bigger and better business."
In June, Rupert Murdoch named James as his successor as chief executive of 21st Century Fox.
Eldest son Lachlan was named co-executive chairman alongside his father.
On Friday, Sky reported that revenues were up 5% to Â£5.72bn in the second half of last year, while operating profit rose by 12% to Â£747m.
The City was encouraged by Sky's results with the company's share price rising 2.2% in early trading.
Sky also said that it is delaying its plans to start selling mobile contracts until near the end of the year.
The company is also launching a new Now TV set-top box that offers free-to-air channels.
"When the new Now TV smart box arrives later this year, it will be the perfect one-stop box to get a contract-free, flexible way of watching the best of pay-TV and free-to-air content all in one place," said Now TV director Gidon Katz.

James Murdoch's return as Sky chair is a major concern, says investor; 
Shareholder claims new role flouts corporate governance code and is a serious conflict of interest because he runs its biggest shareholder, Fox.

Mark Sweney.

A Sky shareholder has criticised James Murdoch's appointment as chairman arguing that it flouts the corporate governance code and is a serious conflict of interest given he runs its biggest shareholder, Fox.
Royal London Asset Management, which owns Â£50m of Sky shares, believes Murdoch's reappointment is "inappropriate".
He was forced to stand down  as chairman of Sky in 2012 in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal at News International, publisher of the Sun, Times and now defunct News of the World, where he had held the role of chairman.  
Broadcasting regulator Ofcom heavily criticised Murdoch's conduct in handling the scandal, saying his conduct "repeatedly fell short" of what was expected of a chairman.
"It wasn't that long ago that the company's own regulator Ofcom said that James's actions were ill-judged and questioned his competence," said Ashley Hamilton Claxton, corporate governance manager at RLAM. "It is surprising the board has chosen to elevate him to the level of chairman again." 
Murdoch, a non-executive director at Sky, was the only candidate put forward by its nominations committee, which is led by outgoing chairman Nick Ferguson.
The three-man committee also comprised Aberdeen Asset Management chief executive Martin Gilbert, who has been promoted to Sky deputy chairman, and independent director Dave Lewis, chief executive of embattled retailer Tesco. 
Murdoch was then unanimously voted chairman by his 11 fellow board members, six of whom are independent directors.
Hamilton Claxton said the appointment raises questions over how rigorous the process of promoting Murdoch was.
She points to the major issue that his appointment breaks best practice of the UK corporate governance code which states that a chairman should be independent.
Murdoch is the chief executive of 21st Century Fox, which controls Sky as the biggest single shareholder with a 39.6% stake.
"His appointment is a major concern because the chairman should be independent," says Hamilton Claxton. "And particularly so in this case as Fox is such a significant shareholder that has shown an interest in taking over the company."
Fox was forced to give up on an Â£8bn-plus bid t o take full control of Sky in 2011 as the fall out from the phone-hacking scandal made it too politically difficult to complete. 
"Should Fox make a bid for Sky, investors need a strong independent chairman to protect the interests of minority shareholders," says Hamilton Claxton. "If there was a situation where a vote was tied we question what extent the chairman will act in the best interests of all shareholders, he is conflicted."
However, the UK corporate governance code is not legally binding. Companies only have to "comply or explain", so Sky was able to ignore the best practice on the independence of the chairman.
Sky also decided against informing or consulting shareholders about the appointment, although there is no legal corporate governance requirement to do so.
"In this day and age of stewardship and promoting better understanding between companies and shareholders it is very unhelpful [not communicating with investors," said Sarah Wilson, the chief executive of shareholder advisory firm Manifest. "The key issuehere is that independent board oversightis going to be crucial because of what some people see as a toxic combination of past problems and the lack of a transparent process. Was there even a search process?" 
Sky defended Murdoch's promotion, pointing out that it has made two strong appointments for balance: Gilbert as his deputy and Andrew Sukawaty who takes over his role as Sky's senior independent director.
"We have a strong board including six independent directors, including the deputy chairman and senior independent director appointed today," said a spokesman for Sky. "The board is used to operating with a large shareholder and has robust processes in place."
However, one observer argues that a number of Sky's directors, such as Gilbert and Lewis, may not be able to give their full focus to Sky because of dealing with major problems at their own businesses.
"Are they going to have the time to properly do their job at Sky, which is crucial with James not being an independent chairman," said the city source. "Both are not just chief executives of FTSE 100 companies, they are at organisations facing challenging conditions. I wouldn't be surprised if other investors call for a board refreshment, fresh independent directors, given this major change." 
In the almost four years since Murdoch moved into a non-executive directorship there has never been a revolt by investors voting against his re-appointment at each annual general meeting.
"In no normal company, with proper regard to standards of corporate governance, would the board appoint someone under whose management between 2007 and 2012 News International engaged in a cover-up of the extent of phone hacking, and by his failures to prevent it cost the company over Â£500m so far," said Evan Harris, joint executive director of the campaigning group Hacked Off. 
Outgoing chairman Ferguson was paid total remuneration of Â£473,934. Sky would not comment on what change Murdoch can expect to his Â£96,500 remuneration as a non-executive director.
"Yet again Rupert Murdoch shows callous disregard for British public opinion," said Chris Bryant, the former shadow culture secretary. "James Murdoch's only defence was incompetence over phone hacking and now he's back."

Japanese yen takes a deliberate dive to keep things turning; 
Big business will not invest in extra production without assurance that the yen will stay low for the time being.

Phillip Inman Economics correspondent.

Japan's exporters need all the help they can get - 25 years of stagnation have taken their toll. So a drive to push down the value of the yen, making it easier to export, can be expected to raise a cheer in the sake bars of Kyoto.
And that's just what the Bank of Japan did when it imposed a 0.1% charge on deposits. It's not the official policy objective - fighting inflation is. Conversely, the central bank emphasises the negative impact on saving and therefore the incentive for corporates to spend their large cash piles. 
But the key to understanding the latest move is the need to maintain an already depressed currency. This is because big business in Japan will not invest in extra production without the assurance that the yen will be low for at least the rest of the business cycle, which they hope could be another five years. Japan is an export junkie that needs the rest of the world to buy much more of the stuff it makes at home than they will ever buy from abroad.
The deposit charge works by acting as a disincentive for international investors to park their money in Tokyo. With fewer funds coming into the country, the demand for yen falls and so does the value of the currency, especially in relation to the all-important dollar.
It was important for the Bank of Japan to shift up a gear for four reasons. The first relates to the China crisis and the fall in the value of the yuan. Japan is increasingly finding that China is a direct competitor in the East Asia region for contracts and major orders. It recently suffered a morale-sapping shock when it lost a high-speed rail contract in Indonesia won by the newly created Chinese national railway company.
The dumping of Chinese steel and other manufactured products has acted as another incentive. It depresses prices again when inflation was only just recovering. The Bank of Japan, like all the major central banks, has a target of 2% stable inflation. Officials forecast last year that prices would rise by 1.4% in 2016. The latest forecast has been cut to 0.8%.
Thirdly, the turmoil in world markets in response to the China slowdown has again turned Japan into a safe haven for international funds. Since last September, when Beijing hit trouble and the Shanghai stock market panicked, cash has poured into Tokyo. The yen, already under pressure, started to climb.
The final straw was the threat from Mario Draghi, the boss of the European Central Bank, that he will cut his deposit rate again in March after already starting down that road last year. 
                     Tokyo is pumping almost Â£50bn a month into the Japanese economy by buying government bonds under a quantitative easing programme. Draghi is doing the same. With this in mind, it was clear that without a decisive move to maintain parity, a further rise in the yen was inevitable.
And it's had the desired effect. From 117 yen to the dollar a week ago, traders must now spend 120 yen to buy a dollar. 
In some ways, it was a wonder the 5/4 vote in favour of a negative deposit rate was so close.
Prime minister Shinzo Abe lost his economy minister on Thursday to a bribery scandal. But that setback cannot be allowed to undermine his compact with big business - if he keeps the yen low, they agree to boost investment, exports and employment. As they all know, only then can Japan's inflation have a hope of reaching the target.

GCHQ whistleblower movie Official Secrets recruits Harrison Ford and Anthony Hopkins; 
How the Observer broke the story of NSA 'dirty tricks' at the UN in the runup to the Iraq war in 2003 will star Natalie Dormer as news source Katharine Gun.

Andrew Pulver.

Harrison Ford and Anthony Hopkins have joined the cast of Official Secrets, the long-mooted film about the Observer's reporting of the GCHQ bugging scandal in 2003, it has been announced. 
In the latest film to cover the activities of whistleblowers and the journalists who report their revelations, Official Secrets will tell the story of Katharine Gun, an officer at the Cheltenham-based government eavesdropping agency. She leaked an email that contained a request by America's NSA to illegally bug the United Nations offices of six key countries in the run-up to the UN's vote on whether to authorise the Iraq war. 
Gun's revelations were reported in the Observer (the Guardian's sister Sunday newspaper) by journalists Martin Bright and Ed Vulliamy, and Gun was arrested and charged with breaking the Official Secrets Act. However, her case was dropped in 2004 after no evidence was offered by the prosecution.
                     According to the Hollywood Reporter, Hopkins will play a retired general and Ford a veteran CIA agent. The have been cast alongside The Hunger Games's Natalie Dormer, who will play Gun, and Paul Bettany as Bright. Martin Freeman plays the Observer's foreign affairs editor - whose character name, Peter Edwards, appears to be a composite of Vulliamy and real-life editor Peter Beaumont, who is now the Guardian's Jerusalem correspondent.
Official Secrets will be directed by Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom 's Justin Chadwick, and shooting is due to start in May.

It's great celebrities are helping in Flint - but the government should do its job; 
It should shock us to see fellow citizens relying on the largesse of remote philanthropic actors for their sustenance.

Chris Lehmann.

The basic facts of the Flint water crisis are appalling enough on their own. But what's also striking, and demoralizing, about the scandal is the way that the institutions of government have largely been supplanted by America's celebrity caring class.
It's undeniably a good use of a famous name and the princely income attached to it to deliver a healthy water supply for the impoverished, abused residents of Flint - and an impressive array of celebrities, from Matt Damon and Cher to Eminem and Big Sean, have stepped in to send clean bottled water to Flint residents. 
 Related:  Flint water crisis: Meet the residents who are feeling the health effects
But it's important not to lose sight of the big picture here. It should shock us to see fellow citizens consigned to the same penitent position that poor people inhabiting failed states in the global South find themselves in - relying on the largesse of remote philanthropic actors (in both senses of the word ) for their sustenance. 
Flint is a former manufacturing capital, long sunk into deindustrialized poverty and civic bankruptcy. The official attempt to fix the system was a fiscal takeover by a myopic, privatization-happy Republican state government. Michigan's Governor Rick Snyder then arranged to have Flint's water supply drawn from the dismally polluted Flint river.
He made this policy call, moreover, in the face of a recent cache of Foia'd documents showing that, far from achieving cost reductions, the Flint water plan was far more expensive than the cleaner alternative of continuing to use Detroit's water and sewage authority. All of this has jeopardized the long-term health of tens of thousands of children exposed to lead-tainted water and may well have caused 10 local fatalities from legionnaires' disease.
Instead of a government fix, we have mass celebrity mobilization, and we should be scandalized at the way this tacitly indicts our civic status quo: rather than living with the reasonable expectation that accountable political leaders can be entrusted with seeing that basic human needs get fulfilled, we're relying on the goodwill of a knowledge-economy aristocracy to make good on government failures. 
 Related:  The EPA's lack of integrity has cost the lead-poisoned children of Flint dearly | Marsha Coleman-Adebayo and Kevin Berends
The outcome is certainly a quantum improvement over the malign neglect that Rick Snyder arranged for the overwhelmingly poor, black and Democratic-voting residents of Flint - but the underlying structure of things here is far more feudal than (small-d) democratic.
Fortunately, there are movements afoot to hold the malefactors in the Michigan power elite legally accountable for the assault on the health of the rising generation of Flint citizens. Three residents have filed a class action suit against Snyder, the city of Flint and the state of Michigan alleging both physical and financial harm stemming from the decision to send poisoned water coursing through their faucets. In a taut summary of the scandal's moral grotesqueness and civic absurdity, the suit alleges that "plaintiffs have been damaged to the extent of the payment for drinkable water they were advised ... not to drink and which was undrinkable". 
Meanwhile, Michigan's attorney general, Bill Schuette - a Republican Snyder crony - is defending the state in the suit, while also touting a Kabuki-style "independent investigation" into the crisis. In a perfectly corrupt flourish, Schuette has named former Wayne County assistant prosecutor Todd Flood to spearhead the investigation; Flood has donated $3,000 to Snyder over the past two election cycles, and a cool $10,200 to Schuette over his last three campaigns. 
Given this carnival of blatant conflicts of interest, it was no great surprise - though still very much a scandal - to learn that the Snyder administration actually began trucking in untainted drinking water to state employees in Flint months before it warned the city's residents away from their poisoned water supply."
In other words, after choking down untold gallons of poisoned water, Flint residents will be expected to swallow a torrent of politicized doublespeak masquerading as an impartial official inquiry. And to begin, slowly and incrementally, to reverse the damage wrought by Snyder's administration, Flint will have to methodically replace all the contaminated pipes in its water system. The problem, as Marketplace reporter Lizzie O'Leary notes, is that no one seems to know just where those pipes are.
It's great that entertainers and athletes are trucking drinkable water into Flint - among other things, this high-profile charitable offensive keeps shining the media spotlight on the city's troubles. But detoxifying the city's water system over the long term will probably cost hundreds of millions; that leaves a considerable deficit in dollars and political will once the Obama administration's emergency allocation of $80m for Flint runs dry. 
To help summon the resources and energy for the struggle ahead, residents of Flint and Michigan alike would likely draw tremendous inspiration from the sight of the man who brought this crisis into their lives dragged before the bar of criminal justice. To quote one outraged onlooker : "He's wearing the wrong kind of pinstripes. They should be going the other way." Cher said that.

The most potent, permanent and elusive figure in British politics; 
His enemies call him the 'PM's puppet-master'. Blair, Brown and Cameron all found him invaluable. He's been at the heart of the most controversial political episodes of recent times. Just who is Jeremy Heywood?.

Andy Beckett.

It is easy to miss the Cabinet Office on Whitehall in central London. To the uninitiated, it is just another bone-coloured, net-curtained facade in the unreadable heartland of British government. Seemingly the only noteworthy thing about the building is that its Victorian bulk stands directly between 10 Downing Street and the outside world. Most visitors to the prime minister have to get past the Cabinet Office first.
Since 2012, the head of this department, the cabinet secretary, has been Sir Jeremy Heywood. In the historian Peter Hennessy 's book Whitehall, one of few successful attempts to explain Britain's labyrinthine and unusually dominant central government, the Cabinet Office, set up exactly a hundred years ago, is described as the "coordinating brain for the whole system".
 Membership Event:  Guardian Live | An evening with the Long Read 
Since well before 2012, Heywood has been the most powerful person in Britain that most people have never heard of. "He is the person who is always in the room with the prime minister, the person who is always there on the conference call," says a former head of the Downing Street Policy Unit (even Heywood's former colleagues usually prefer to talk about him off the record). He was economic and domestic policy secretary to prime minister Tony Blair from 1997 to 1998, and his principal private secretary from 1999 to 2003; head of domestic policy for prime minister Gordon Brown from 2007 to 2008; and Downing Street permanent secretary, first for Brown and then for David Cameron, from 2008 to 2011.
Through two temperamentally opposed Labour administrations, the turbulent Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, and into the current, dominant-but-brittle Tory government, Heywood has been a uniquely influential constant in Downing Street: a fixer and an enforcer, a confidant and a coordinator, a peacemaker and a crisis manager, an assessor of policies, an interpreter of protocol, a relentless accumulator of responsibilities and contacts and institutional knowledge, a conductor of internal inquiries, a keeper of secrets. A former Downing Street chief of staff says: "Jeremy's like a drug. People get addicted to him quite quickly. Prime ministers are not sure about him at first. Then they say, 'Umm, that's rather good. I need that.'"
Jeremy's like a drug. People get addicted to him quite quickly
His one absence from Downing Street was a senior job at the American bank Morgan Stanley between 2003 and 2007. And even that was interrupted by cravings for Heywood from No 10. As soon as Brown became prime minister in 2007, one of his closest allies says: "One of our priorities was to get Jeremy back from the City."
Heywood has been so central to British government for so long that few of its most contentious modern episodes have not involved him: the Iraq war and its aftermath; the hasty formation of the coalition; the Conservatives' encouragement of Rupert Murdoch's abortive bid for BSkyB ; the News of the World phone-hacking scandal and Cameron's employment of its former editor  Andy Coulson ; the alleged gagging of ministers over airport expansion and the EU referendum ; the row over British plans to restrict benefits for EU migrants ; the Plebgate affair that ruined the government chief whip Andrew Mitchell; the government's refusal to release official papers on the treatment of trade unionists and other Tory foes during the 1970s and 1980s; the attempted silencing of the National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden.
Confirmed Heywood interventions are rare. In June 2013, he visited this newspaper and warned its then editor, Alan Rusbridger, that the Guardian's involvement with Snowden could make it a target for "our guys" in British intelligence and "Chinese agents on your staff". In September 2014, just before the Scottish independence referendum, the Queen made a carefully loaded public statement which bent the rules of royal impartiality to the advantage of the no campaign. "I hope people will think very carefully about the future", she told a crowd near her Scottish residence at Balmoral. Heywood had co-written it with her private secretary, Sir Christopher Geidt.
Much more often, Heywood's exact contribution to government policies and decisions is the subject of rumour and counter-rumour, of briefings by underlings and allies and enemies. Only his ubiquity and importance are universally agreed on. "He has the ability to be 24/7 in Downing Street but also well-connected to the outside world. He has sources in other government departments," says a former head of the Downing Street Policy Unit. Another former colleague of Heywood's from Downing Street says: "Jeremy would quite often think he could do things better than someone else, that a project would be improved by a bit of Jeremy input."
There is no official manual that sets out what the cabinet secretary is supposed to do. Last year Heywood sketched some of his activities for one of Cameron's biographers, Anthony Seldon. "Every morning, we kick off with a prime minister's meeting. Sometimes we have an afternoon meeting as well ... I help the prime minister to think through what should be on the cabinet agenda. I sit next to the prime minister in cabinet, and take a record of what's been discussed ... [then] making sure that is followed through."
Like almost everything Heywood says in public, the tone was informal, unstuffy, seemingly straightforward. For anyone who learned about cabinet secretaries from Sir Humphrey Appleby, the grand, gleefully manipulative holder of the post in the 1980s television satire Yes, Prime Minister, Heywood can initially appear a disappointment. He is a northerner, as his vowels sometimes show despite over a quarter of a century in Whitehall. He speaks quietly and without drama. In his palatial office, all wood panelling and chandeliers, his desk is small and nondescript and unshowily tucked into a corner. He sometimes receives visitors with his jacket off, and, at 54, still wears his hair in a boyish quiff. In his rimless glasses, with his tirelessly precise sentences, he is more like a senior accountant or a top management consultant than the pinstriped mandarins of civil service legend.
But power in Whitehall has always come in many guises. The more you ponder Heywood's roles as he described them to Seldon - "I help the prime minister to think"; "making sure" cabinet decisions are "followed through" - the larger they seem. "He understands how to make this massive machine move," says Rohan Silva, who was, between 2010 and 2013, a key member of the Downing Street Policy Unit. "He reads everything. He works harder than anyone I've ever worked with. If you CC him on an email, it clears a path through the bureaucracy. But he wears it all very lightly. The PM and the chancellor just think he's great."
Last year, Heywood was also made head of the civil service. Alongside his backstage Downing Street role, he became the public face and boss of an organisation of 390,000 employees, which, in the austerity era, is going through possibly the most brutal job cull in its history. "For many people this [job] would be one of the biggest things they did," Heywood told a recent gathering of senior civil servants and Whitehall-watchers at the Institute for Government. "It is just number five on my list."
Heywood has made enemies. To the conservative magazine the Spectator, he is "the PM's puppet-master", curbing Cameron's more innovative impulses to protect Whitehall's interests; or "'Wormtongue' after Tolkien's poisonous power behind the throne in the Lord of the Rings". To the Daily Mail, he is the "eminence grease", "Whitehall's most cynical mandarin", and "Sir Cover-up", allegedly responsible for undermining the Freedom of Information Act and the Chilcot inquiry into the UK's role in the Iraq war.
In 2011, even before Heywood's most recent promotions, the perceptive rightwing commentator Peter Oborne wrote in the Daily Telegraph that Heywood was "a perfect manifestation of everything that has gone so very wrong with the British civil service over the past 15 years - too cosy a relationship between public and private, too much dominance at the centre, contempt for tradition and the collapse of due process." In 2013, the Times reported that Heywood was becoming "an increasingly controversial figure in Whitehall": "not explicitly disloyal" to ministers with whom he disagreed, but "unhelpful to the government". Heywood had allegedly told a recent meeting of bankers that "his job was being made harder by the differing priorities of senior government figures", as if one of the government's objectives ought to be making his job easier.
Heywood also has critics on the left. To the Labour MP Paul Flynn, he is "a politician who thinks he's a civil servant, and a civil servant who thinks he's a politician"; "slippery" and lacking the civil service's traditional neutrality; "He takes the prime minister's side too quickly." A prominent Tory MP says: "Heywood is regarded with quite a lot of suspicion by MPs. He's not avuncular and reassuring in his style. He's sometimes a little too enthusiastic at finding some contorted way of supporting the government. He's prepared to come before a select committee and say that black is white. That creates a mistrust. People describe him as a courtier."
Heywood's critics tend to be foes of Whitehall. And some of their criticisms of him seem incompatible. Can he be both Cameron's courtier and controller? Too loyal to the government and disloyal? A secret Blairite, as some rightwingers insist, while also the eager servant of Tory governments? Yet politics, especially gossipy high politics, is not always fair or logical; and the fact is that after decades of discreet influence - "I try my best to stay invisible," he said on his first, belated appearance before a select committee in 2012 - Heywood has become a story. And civil servants are not supposed to be. "He's not a bad man," says the Conservative MP David Davis, a frequent adversary. "But he does need to worry that he's become controversial." Heywood has become the personification of Whitehall in an era when Whitehall is shrinking and unpopular. Has he reached the zenith of his influence at precisely the wrong moment?

* * *
                     Heywood was born in the former mill town of Glossop, outside Manchester, in 1961. His mother was an archaeologist and his father was an English teacher at a private Quaker school, Bootham, in York. The Heywoods were not Quakers, but they liked the school's ethos: it encourages pupils to be precociously confident without being loud, to listen carefully to others, and to resolve conflicts without the heavy-handed application of rules. Heywood became head boy. "He was not a dynamic leader, had no great powers of oratory, but he knew absolutely everything that was going on in school," says Michael Allen, who taught him history and cricket. "He had quite a good relationship with the school rogues. He was a friend of everyone."
Heywood applied to Oxford University to study history and economics. "He came back from [his] interview and said he'd mucked it up," Allen recalls. "The dons had asked him about statistics, which he'd only just started studying. Shortly after the interview, the dons sought me out and said, 'You've got such a clever young man here. We just wanted to keep him off his familiar ground.'" They gave Heywood a scholarship.
His chosen Oxford college, Hertford, was one of the university's less grandiose, known for its leftwing politics and unusual number of students from state schools. When he started there in 1980, "it was quite a lively time", remembers a friend and fellow undergraduate. "Thatcher had just been elected. We had friends who were anarchists, post-punks. Jeremy was anti-establishment - or at least very comfortable in the company of lefties. He was a chainsmoker. He pogoed at parties and discos. He went with the anarchists on an overland trip to Pakistan."
But Heywood is a good compartmentaliser. In 1983 he left Oxford with a first and a place in the fast stream of the civil service. It was then a familiar thing for an ambitious graduate to do: the civil service workforce had hit an all-time peak of 750,000 only six years earlier, and although the Thatcher government was steadily reducing it, there were more than one-and-a-half times as many civil servants as there are now.
After a year as an economist at a relatively new and marginal department, the Health and Safety Executive - for critics of Heywood and Whitehall, a byword for maddening caution and bureaucracy - he moved quickly to one of the civil service's traditional centres of power: the Treasury. Because it controls the money, writes Hennessy, "The Treasury has a window into every ministry." In 1984, when Heywood joined, the Treasury was particularly potent, with a self-confident new chancellor, Nigel Lawson, and the British economy finally beginning to boom again after the recessions of the 1970s and early 80s.
Heywood was one of many sharp youngsters in the department. He soon became known for expertly combining technical tasks with more politically delicate work. "I first met Jeremy at the Treasury in 86 or 87," says the economist Jonathan Portes, who remains a close friend. "He was working as private secretary to [the Treasury minister] Norman Lamont." Lamont had received a letter from a famous showbiz Tory complaining about their tax bill. Portes had drafted a dismissive reply. "Jeremy thought it was too brusque," he says. "And Jeremy won."
Another former Treasury colleague remembers: "Jeremy was the most phenomenal private secretary of his generation. Nobody else has the stamina or the bandwidth. He would run his minister's life. Sort out which papers they saw. Link them to their department. It's a job he's gone on doing, for progressively more important people."
In 1990, Lamont became chancellor. The following year, he and the slightly gauche new prime minister, John Major, took part in the fraught Maastricht treaty negotiations that created the modern European Union. At one point, Major recalls in his autobiography, the British delegation mislaid the prime minister's entire bargaining script. "A frantic search took place as I returned to the negotiations without it ... Eventually Jeremy Heywood, Norman Lamont's able private secretary, let out a whoop of delight. He had discovered it among Norman's papers."
Not yet 30, Heywood was already a distinct Whitehall presence: even younger-looking than his years, floppy-haired, skinny verging on gaunt, often speaking in a discreet murmur but intimidatingly confident, still a ferocious smoker. Instead of taking public transport to and from work, he would get lifts with colleagues so he could lean out of the window and keep puffing.
Between 1992 and 1993, David Cameron worked with him, as Lamont's special adviser. According to Cameron's recent biographers Michael Ashcroft and Isabel Oakeshott, the future prime minister was "in awe" of Heywood. They quote the veteran Tory journalist and Cameron-watcher Bruce Anderson: "People thought [Heywood] lived off coffee and cigarettes. He'd get stopped at airports because he looked like a druggy. [Cameron] thought he was ... the cleverest guy he'd ever met."

In 1992, the Treasury's status and self-esteem were suddenly punctured when Britain was forced to withdraw from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), a precursor to the euro. Lamont was sacked as chancellor soon afterwards. But Heywood, less directly associated with the ERM policy, survived, first as private secretary for the new chancellor, Ken Clarke, and then in an even more senior and sensitive Treasury role. In 1994, with the government cutting public spending to pay for the ERM fiasco, - a shrinking of the state that would become almost as severe and prolonged as the current one -  Heywood was asked to lead a "fundamental review" of the ministry's running costs.
He did it with gusto. While the Treasury had been telling other departments to tighten their belts for decades, its own operations, in Heywood's view, were too unfocused and hierarchical. His report recommended that the Treasury be given "concrete objectives", such as "delivering permanently low inflation" and "maintaining sound public finances"; that some of its work be handed to "other government departments or the private sector"; and most provocatively of all, that it cut its "senior management posts" by "around 30%".
Many of Heywood's colleagues were aghast. "I know of no one here," an anonymous senior official told the Guardian at the time, "who would dissent from the view that morale is the worst in living memory." The part of the Treasury where the threatened mandarins worked became known as "the corridor of death". But many of Heywood's recommendations were enacted, including the job cuts. He felt that he had made an important contribution to the modernisation of British government. He stayed at the unsettled Treasury for another three years. "Jeremy has a chip of ice in him," says a friend.

* * *
                     What Heywood actually believes is the subject of debate among even his closest colleagues and friends. All agree that, unlike many civil servants, he lacks a party-political side, even in the most private social contexts. "He's the most non-political person I've ever met," says a former Downing Street colleague. "It's like he had an operation and someone removed the political bit." Heywood does vote, but only he, and possibly his family, know who for.
Yet, occasionally, off-duty, he lets off steam. An old friend who goes out for dinner with him intermittently says: "He talks about what's been happening at work that day. To the extent that he gets angry, it's always been because individuals have been behaving badly... or incompetence... or something conspicuously wasteful." The latter is a longstanding Heywood preoccupation. Someone who worked closely with him for years under Blair says: "He can't stand waste. He has a pretty laser-like focus on efficiency and rationality. He's like one of those time and motion men from the 60s: you can imagine him going round with a clipboard." In the otherwise bland articles and blogs he writes as head of the civil service, about improving working practices and meeting diversity targets, Heywood sometimes describes himself as "a data man".
In public, he often uses the language of business to explain the work of government: the civil service is "a net exporter of ideas" to foreign bureaucracies; "ministers are customers for our advice"; official reports are "product". "Jeremy is an expression of the management culture that has gradually taken over Whitehall since the 80s," says a former Brown adviser. "It's a free-market conception of statecraft." Or you could see it as a way of justifying the continued existence of government in an anti-government age.
"You can't just have grand old Whitehall figures in leather armchairs making promises and policy statements, as you could in the old days," says Jonathan Powell, Blair's former chief of staff, who joined the civil service in 1979. "Modern politicians of all parties are desperate for [tangible] things to change on the ground." It is a climate that suits Heywood. Powell says: "Jeremy is impatient - an attribute of people who get things done."
Former and current colleagues say that over the decades Heywood has acquired his own policy preoccupations - deregulating the economy, improving British competitiveness, updating the welfare system - and that he prefers working for reforming governments. Richard Reeves, director of strategy for the deputy prime minister Nick Clegg during the coalition's first two years, says: "Heywood does well under radicals, of the left or the right. He's a very long way from Sir Humphrey. He wants to use the power of government to change things."
At the same time, Heywood also believes in order and continuity. In public, he likes to distil the messy, overflowing business of government to pithy lists of achievements and tasks, of official structures and procedures. He talks about crises being "managed down". He regards much of the media as overexcitable: "There's a lot of rhetoric in the newspapers," he told the public administration committee in 2012, "but the business of government goes on." He speaks quickly but smoothly, with so few hesitations and such a command of detail that it is easy to picture ministers and prime ministers - tired or inexperienced, perhaps, or distracted by party-political matters - listening a little passively, and then doing whatever "Jeremy" suggests.
In 1997, when Labour returned to office after an 18-year absence, Tony Blair quickly summoned Heywood from the Treasury. The two men spoke for a few minutes at No 10, while Blair sat on a sofa and ate an apple. Then the new prime minister hired Heywood as his economic and domestic policy secretary. Despite spending his career so far working for Conservative governments, Heywood was now one of the new premier's most senior advisers. Or at least, he was in theory. The ambitious Blair government was full of advisers jostling for influence, and in the maze of Downing Street Heywood was given a desk in a different room from Powell, Blair's key lieutenant. Heywood refused to settle for it; instead, he manoeuvred his way into sharing Powell's office. Blair's inner circle were impressed.
They were also impressed by Heywood's working style. Polite and unmacho in meetings - useful qualities in a government with too many alpha males - he could be cutting in other contexts. "I would hear him on the phone with Treasury people," says someone who was with him in Blair's Downing Street. "They're so incredibly rude to each other. They have an offensive, not defensive, negotiating style. Jeremy's very dry, very ascetic, very precise - not like Tony or Gordon at all."
Blair quickly came to rely on Heywood as a troubleshooter. In 2000, when anti-tax protests at fuel depots began to starve the country of petrol, Powell wrote later, "in desperation" the government "got the operational heads of all the major oil companies and the police ... to come into the Cabinet Office, and installed them in a small, chilly office ... Jeremy Heywood and I moved in there with them, and we kept them working day and night." After a week, the protests petered out.
But Heywood's most valued troubleshooting was internal. With relations increasingly sour between Blair and Brown, go-betweens were required to hold the government together. The chancellor's emissary was his combative economic adviser, Ed Balls, and initially the prime minister was represented by Powell. But by 1999 Powell had had enough, and Heywood took over the role. He had reservations about Brown. "I remember coming out of a meeting at Chequers in 1998 at which Gordon had been particularly difficult," says a former Labour spin doctor, "and Jeremy said to me, 'That man will make a terrible PM!'" But Heywood mostly kept such thoughts to himself, and from his Treasury days he understood the power of a chancellor. The Brownites, in turn, respected Heywood for his Treasury work; had Blair not done so first, the chancellor would have hired him.
For several years, Heywood and Balls met almost daily - often three times daily. Most of the unadvertised meetings took place at the Treasury. But every Tuesday morning, from 8.30 to 9.30, they met on more neutral territory, at Cafe Churchill on Whitehall. The Italian greasy spoon (now gone) sold overpriced, watery cappuccino, but was only yards from both Downing Street and the Treasury, and its interior, only dimly visible from the street, was small enough to deter eavesdroppers.
"Jeremy has this gift for managing to find a way through acrimonious, seemingly impossible situations, picking out what matters most to people, and managing to persuade everyone that they've won," says Portes. Balls came to trust Heywood: first, as a reliable guide to Blair's thinking; then, increasingly, as a government player in his own right. As Seldon put it in his 2007 book Blair Unbound: "Balls had no respect for Blair as an economist or a thinker, and assumed that he merely took his script from Heywood." A politician who has worked closely with Heywood says: "To be very good at being a private secretary or cabinet secretary, you have to be very close to the boundary between civil service work and politics, but not step over it. He is very good at that."
Yet even Heywood's appetite for Whitehall intrigue is not infinite. During the early 2000s he began to talk to colleagues about taking a sabbatical. One motivation was personal. In 1994, while compiling his unsparing report on the Treasury, he had met and worked with Suzanne Cook, a civil servant who was even more organised than he was. They married in 1997, and in 2002 they had their first child.
The following year, Heywood's plan to take some time off with his new son turned into something larger: he left Downing Street and the civil service, and joined Morgan Stanley, which went on to hire a succession of senior Labour figures including Powell and Alistair Darling. The hours were shorter, the pay was much better, and after 20 years in Whitehall, Heywood wanted a new environment. His only other break had been a brief secondment in the late 1980s to the British delegation at the International Monetary Fund in Washington DC, a traditional initiation for Treasury high-fliers into the realities of Britain's place in the world.
At Morgan Stanley, Heywood adjusted to other realities, taking banking exams and acquiring the transatlantic lift to the end of his sentences which often marks out members of the modern British elite. Based in London as an adviser on mergers and acquisitions, and then as co-head of Morgan Stanley's UK investment banking division, he was excited by the City's constant hunger for innovations. But he found making money for himself and others less fulfilling than helping run the country. In 2007, after only four years, Brown, now prime minister, persuaded him to come back to Whitehall.
Brown's young government was struggling. It had hastily called off a general election and was unpopular, divided, derided by the press and a resurgent Conservative opposition. "The No 10 operation was in a total tailspin," says a Downing Street veteran of the time. Brown was hiding away in his office, working too hard, and hiring too many advisers; power was chaotically scattered through Downing Street.
"Heywood brought a kind of order," says the veteran. Heywood helped persuade Brown and his key staff to work in the same room, and took a desk right next to the prime minister. Heywood processed Brown's incessant demands calmly. Heywood delegated. "If you come to a meeting with Jeremy," says the veteran, "you'll go away with something to do."
Even Heywood's banking experience and contacts proved useful. By leaving the City, he had narrowly avoided direct association with the 2007-8 financial crisis, and instead became a valued part of the government's efforts to help resolve it, chairing meetings all over Whitehall in the run-up to the G20 summit about the crisis in London in 2009. During the gathering, he told Seldon with rare feeling: "We had a wonderful dinner ... Just leaders. No 10 is beautiful on those sorts of evenings. Very intimate. You just sort of see the power in the room, and you just know you're involved around the edges ... of historic moments."
The Brown government stabilised enough to stop the Conservatives winning the 2010 election outright. And the hung parliament presented Heywood with yet more opportunities to be useful and influential. In the Labour peer Andrew Adonis's well-informed account of the formation of the coalition, 5 Days In May, Heywood appears "in hushed phone conversation at his desk" for most the period, "often with the Queen's private secretary" about the constitutional complexities of the situation. But once the Tory-Lib Dem coalition crystallised, Heywood was quick to ready himself for his new masters. In the famous photographs of the final moments of the Brown administration, he is wearing a blue tie.

* * *
                     After the intensity of Brown, the workaholic Heywood took a while to get used to Cameron's more relaxed approach to being prime minister. "I vividly remember a budget meeting out at Chequers," says a former coalition adviser. "We were discussing something important, like tax credits, and Cameron tried to bring the conversation to a close, because he wanted lunch. The look on Heywood's face! You could see the jolt of surprise."
The adviser continues: "There was less of an intellectual fit between Heywood and Cameron's people than there had been between him and the Blairites and Brownites. But Cameron came to rely on him. You could  see the relief with which he delegated to him." The inexperienced Tory-Lib Dem coalition also needed his deal-making. During 2011 and 2012, when the parties fell out over whether employment rights should be drastically reduced, in order to (in theory) revive the economy, Heywood suggested a compromise that such rights should only be weakened at startup companies. "No one else had thought of it," says one of those involved in the discussions. "It was a moment of pure Heywood."
With his reforming mindset, and his Treasury background, Heywood got on well with the restless new chancellor, George Osborne. But Cameron's director of strategy, Steve Hilton, was an outspoken critic of Whitehall: he wanted the government to shrink the number of civil servants by three-quarters. At first, Heywood was surprisingly friendly towards his rival. According to Matthew D'Ancona's history of the coalition, In It Together, "Heywood claimed to agree with much of what [Hilton] stood for and urged him to persist." Heywood was keen on efficiency, after all. But when Hilton tried to turn his ideas into government policy, Heywood abruptly withdrew his support: telling MPs that Hilton's plan to gut the civil service, for example, was not "remotely" the government's approach. Cameron and the Downing Street machine ultimately sided with Heywood: "They liked smooth surfaces and courteous negotiation rather than the deliberate disruption that Hilton favoured," writes D'Ancona. In 2012 it was announced that Hilton was leaving the government for a university post in America. Shortly afterwards, Heywood was asked by the public administration committee about his Downing Street relationship with Hilton. The cabinet secretary swept a hand across the committee table, fingers outstretched, palm outward. "Steve has now left for California," he said. "As far as I'm aware."
Heywood doesn't enjoy appearing before such committees. He sees the cabinet secretary's job as essentially private - to be an intimate of the powerful and advise them frankly - and therefore not a very useful object of public scrutiny. But the committees summon him increasingly often, anyway, and question him more and more impatiently, sometimes with open exasperation. His relentlessly level voice, his transatlantic mannerisms, his liking for jargon - "It's on my dashboard," he will say, deflatingly, of a potentially juicy controversy - all this can make him seem like a member of the Whitehall establishment, minus the traditional charm; a reined-in and unshowy mandarin for unforgiving times.
"His body language is defensive," says Flynn, who is on the public administration committee. "He hasn't built a rapport with us." In an era of small or nonexistent Westminster majorities, nosy, troublemaking MPs such as Flynn and Davis are increasingly common. Belatedly perhaps, they have woken up to Heywood's importance. Or they have settled for grilling him as a way of getting at the slippery Cameron. "Part of the role of cabinet secretary," says a former Heywood colleague, "is to be the PM's human shield."
Heywood dislikes media attention even more than select committees. He hates being called "Sir Cover-up" by the Daily Mail. Given all his speeches and committee appearances, given the profusion of online official material about the Cabinet Office's activities, - which have expanded in recent years, to include everything from the controversial new system of electoral registration to making government procurement more efficient - Heywood considers himself the most transparent cabinet secretary ever.
There is evidence to the contrary. Last September, he said that the Freedom of Information Act had had "some chilling effects" on the operation of government. The publication of the Chilcot report has undeniably been delayed by long negotiations between the inquiry and Heywood about the release of correspondence between Blair and President George W Bush. But it is too simple, and too convenient for the many people in Whitehall, past and present, with things to hide, to see Heywood's actions in these areas as wholly his own. All cabinet secretaries are sometimes ordered to play Sir Cover-up.
Where Heywood stands out, perhaps, is the stubbornness and ingenuity with which he defends the freedom of action of governments, and of prime ministers in particular. Rather than codes of conduct or fixed Whitehall structures, he murmurs to the select committees, he favours "precedent", "discretion", "responsiveness". This is the traditional clever bodging of British central government. A degree of instability in politics also puts a premium on civil servants, like Heywood, who can offer the opposite.
With the exception of the magazine Civil Service World, Heywood almost never gives on-the-record interviews to reporters, and declined to do so for this article. The more he says in public, he believes, the more journalists will speculate about him, the more manipulations they will attribute to him. But it is almost certainly too late for such reticence: newspaper sketchwriters already converge on his every committee appearance.
The government's spending cuts, too, are making his life more challenging. State employees he meets on official trips around the country as head of the civil service are sometimes scathing to him about their workplace burdens and conditions. "I'm sure that he's worried," says one of his oldest friends. "I don't think he has a view about whether the cuts are the right thing to do, per se, but if they make the civil service less effective, that would be the opposite of what he has devoted his career to."
By the next general election, Heywood will be approaching 60. He has three children, and they will all still be teenagers. He is closely involved with them, when his Downing Street duties permit: his list of recreations in Who's Who reads, "childcare, modern art, cinema, Manchester United". His wife Suzanne is now a partner at the management consultants McKinsey. She earns a lot more than his Â£195,000 salary, which is high but not exceptional for a top civil servant - the ultra-competitive Heywood has been known to complain about the disparity - and she is younger. It is possible to imagine him retiring to their large house in south London, with its walk-in wine cellar and the numerous other extensions they have added, which look onto the deep garden. The Heywoods are holders of good, politically eclectic parties.
Portes insists that his friend Jeremy is "still in love with his work. He has this gift for juggling 16 things at once, for keeping it all in his head". A former close colleague of Heywood says: "There have always been a few people like him in the civil service: very, very big brain capacities, good interlocutors, always in the key meetings - activist civil servants. They always have their supporters, and their detractors. In the 70s, [the head of the civil service] Sir William Armstrong was called 'the deputy prime minister'." But Heywood's ex-colleague does not mention that Armstrong left government after a nervous breakdown.
For now, the most permanent, most potent and most elusive unelected figure in British government can be glimpsed at work more easily than you might imagine. From Horseguards Parade behind Whitehall, after darkness falls, the interior of a particularly fine Victorian office is milkily visible through three net-curtained, first-floor windows. A desk light blazes. A shirtsleeved figure, slightly heavier than in his youth, pads comfortably around, deep into the evening. Sir Jeremy Heywood is working late again.

New play brings undercover spy scandal to the stage; 
The new drama explores how undercover policemen were sent to spy on political groups and deceived women into forming intimate relationships.

Rob Evans.

A new play about undercover policemen and the pain they have inflicted on women is due to open next week. 
"Any Means Necessary" is based on the true story of the police's long-running covert infiltration of political groups.  
The play looks at how the undercover officers deceived women into forming long-term relationships with them during their covert missions. It also shows how the women turned the tables and searched for the truth about the men's deception. 
The drama is based on the exposure of Mark Kennedy, the undercover policeman who infiltrated environmental groups, and the collapse of the prosecution of campaigners after it was revealed that crucial evidence had been concealed by the state.
The play is due to run between February 5 and 20 at the Nottingham Playhouse. Nottingham was where Kennedy spied on campaigners during his secret mission. 
Writer Kefi Chadwick has talked to many of those who have been involved in the controversy about undercover policing. They include Alison, who had a five-year relationship with undercover police officer Mark Jenner (for background, read this ). 
Chadwick said: "These cases show an incredible abuse of human rights and civil liberties and are one of the biggest police scandals of all time." She told the Sunday Times :"This is a story about women who were abused by the state, but have taken that power back to bring the people concerned to account. I didn't want to write a play about victims. I am sick of seeing women as victims, on screen dead, or sex trafficked or raped... those stories are valid, but this is about bringing the people who've done that wrong to you into the light."

Publicity for the play can be found here and here. The text of her drama is due to be published as a book next month. 
The title of the play "Any Means Necessary" is drawn from the unofficial motto of the Special Demonstration Squad, one of the undercover units at the heart of the controversy.
There will be a series of meetings connected to the play that will be held at the Nottingham Playhouse.
On February 11, Helen Steel (one of the defendants in the long-running Mclibel trial) will talk about how undercover policeman John Dines deceived her during a two-year relationship. She will be joined by Bruce Kent, vice-president of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, who will talk about how a spy infiltrated CND. ( More details here ). 
On February 13, Donal O'Driscoll of the Undercover Research Group (a network of activists who are investigating the police's covert infiltration of political groups) will speak about their work. ( More details here ). The group is also holding a series of roundtable meetings around the country about unmasking police spies - see this here for more information. 
On February 17, Chadwick and Merrick Badger, from the Campaign Opposing Police Surveillance and one of the activists who helped unmask Kennedy, will discuss the spy scandal. (Details are here ).

James Murdoch returns as Sky chairman; 
Rupert Murdoch's younger son stepped down from the pay-TV group in 2012 in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal.

Mark Sweney.

James Murdoch is to return to Sky as chairman, almost four years after he was forced to stand down in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal.
Murdoch, who was chief executive and then chairman from 2003 to 2012, stepped down from the then BSkyB because of the fallout from the phone hacking scandal at News International, publisher of the Sun, Times and now defunct News of the World, where he held the role of chairman.
At the time Murdoch said he felt it right to stand down as chairman of Sky - which is 39.6% owned by Rupert Murdoch's Fox- to avoid becoming a "lightning rod" for criticism of Sky because of his association with the phone-hacking scandal. 
Murdoch, who remained a Sky non-executive director after stepping down as chairman, replaces Nick Ferguson who is leaving the company after 12 years. 
"I would like to thank Nick for his outstanding contribution to the board over the last decade and more. I am proud to have been asked by the board to serve as chairman of Sky, one of the world's leading pay TV companies," said Murdoch. 
"Jeremy and the team at Sky have done an outstanding job in building a dynamic and successful company. As chairman, I look forward to working with the board and management as they continue to deliver a great service for Sky's customers and create value for all shareholders over the years to come." 
The Sky chief executive, Jeremy Darroch, brushed off any assertion that Murdoch should not be Sky chairman.
"Without a doubt he is the right man for the job," he said, in a conference call with media on Friday morning. 
Murdoch was the sole candidate put forward to Sky's board by the nominations committee. 
"The board was unanimous in support of James. At the time he stepped aside he felt was putting interests of the company ahead of his own. [Since then] he has been consistently re-elected by shareholders [as a non-executive director]. It was a smooth process and got to a good outcome. His knowledge of the international media industry will be a big asset." 
Thomas Singlehurst, an analyst at Citi, said that Murdoch's appointment "may raise some questions about the balance of the board between independents/non-independents".
James Murdoch's handling of the phone-hacking scandal came under fire from MPs and others.
Broadcasting regulator Ofcom, which ruled Sky was a fit and proper broadcaster to hold a licence following an investigation prompted by the phone-hacking scandal, heavily criticised Murdoch.
Ofcom said Murdoch's conduct in handling of the hacking scandal "repeatedly fell short" of that expected of the chief executive and chairman at News International. 
The regulator criticised his "failure" to take action, which Ofcom said was "difficult to comprehend and ill-judged". 
James's return marks the latest stage of a remarkable reassertion of power by Rupert Murdoch over his UK and European media assets. 
In September, News Corp confirmed the return of Rebekah Brooks as chief executive of News UK, a year after she was cleared of all charges related to the phone-hacking scandal.  
The return of James Murdoch will further ignite rumours that Fox, where he holds the role of chief executive, may look to mount another bid to take full control of Sky.
Fox was forced to give up on an Â£8bn-plus bid to take full control of Sky UK in 2011.
In October, James Murdoch hinted at ownership change at Sky, now a pan-European operator after taking full control of Sky in Germany and Italy, when he said that not having complete control of Sky "is not an end state that is natural for us". 
Darroch said on Friday: "I think that from time time there is speculation about what Fox's intentions are. As management we don't get distracted by that. I can't speak for Fox but [James] and they continue to be passionate supporters for Sky's ongoing success. Our job is to keep building a bigger and better business."
In June, Rupert Murdoch named James as his successor as chief executive of 21st Century Fox.
Eldest son Lachlan was named co-executive chairman alongside his father.
On Friday, Sky reported that revenues were up 5% to Â£5.72bn in the second half of last year, while operating profit rose by 12% to Â£747m.
The City was encouraged by Sky's results with the company's share price rising 2.2% in early trading.
Sky also said that it is delaying its plans to start selling mobile contracts until near the end of the year.
The company is also launching a new Now TV set-top box that offers free-to-air channels.
"When the new Now TV smart box arrives later this year, it will be the perfect one-stop box to get a contract-free, flexible way of watching the best of pay-TV and free-to-air content all in one place," said Now TV director Gidon Katz.

The NFL Talkboard awards: phenomenal Cam Newton deserves the glory; 
We can't get enough of the NFL - and 2015 has been memorable in more ways than one. Paolo Bandini gives out the prizes in his end-of-season review.

Paolo Bandini.

"You like that! You! Like! That!" Kirk Cousins was not asking a question when he roared at reporters in the bowels of FedEx Field this October, but instead providing the answer. We do like that. In fact, we cannot get enough of it. 
 Related:  Timmy Smith: the rise, fall and rise of the Super Bowl's most mysterious legend
No scandal, no unwelcome political endorsements, no quantity of grim evidence of the impact that football is having on the long-term mental health of its participants has yet been enough to persuade us to stop watching the NFL. Instead, TV ratings rose yet again in 2015-16 - from the regular season right through to the conference championship games.
That is a testament to the entertainment on offer, of which Cousins' performance on and off the field against Tampa Bay was a prime example. Before telling us what we liked, he had shown us - throwing for three touchdowns and rushing for one more as he rallied Washington from a 24-point deficit to complete the biggest comeback in team history. 
It was just one of many memorable moments from a season in which the NFL both broke new boundaries - getting its first female coach, and then its first full-time one - and turned back the clocks to approve the Rams' return to LA. 
A season in which long-standing records were shattered but also more bones than we would care to mention. A season that will conclude in a week's time with one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time squaring off in what might be his final game against the face of the new generation. 
Until then, you will just have to make do with our annual awards. 

Most outstanding player/most valuable player
                     Last year I abandoned the MVP from these awards in favour of an MOP - making the case that "Most Outstanding" (as used in the CFL and NCAA) was a more meaningful designation than "Most Valuable", since the latter phrasing inevitably skews our minds towards quarterbacks. But this season my winner would be the same either way.
Cam Newton has been phenomenal. His 35 touchdown passes were tied for second in the NFL during the regular season, while his 10 rushing touchdowns were joint-fifth (and it would only have taken one more to elevate him to joint-first, alongside Adrian Peterson, Devonta Freeman, Jeremy Hill and DeAngelo Williams). A league-best 7.1% of all Newton's throws went for a score. His 636 rushing yards were more than any tailback achieved in Detroit or Tennessee.
Yes, Carolina's schedule could have been tougher, and yes, he was aided by a robust offensive line, productive ground game and Greg Olsen. But he also lost his top wide receiver, Kelvin Benjamin, in pre-season and instead got 10 touchdowns out of Ted Ginn. 
And, while voters in the official (AP) version of this award submitted their nominations at the end of the regular season, we are also free here to consider the fact that he has produced brilliant back-to-back playoff performances against what were supposed to be two of the better defenses in the NFC. I would still have made the same decision beforehand, but further supporting evidence never hurts. 

Offensive player of the year
I've never really understood the logic behind voting for one player as MVP and then a different one as player of the year on the same side of the ball. Carson Palmer, Tom Brady and Russell Wilson all had fantastic years, as did non-quarterbacks like Adrian Peterson and Julio Jones. In particular, I'd like to give Antonio Brown some recognition - because if it hadn't been for the month-long Michael Vick debacle in Pittsburgh, he would almost certainly have smashed the single-season receiving record. 
But this award still goes to Newton, for all the reasons listed above.

Defensive player of the year
There is a temptation to pick someone other than JJ Watt here, for the sake of novelty. He has won it in two of the last three seasons, and with so much media attention does feel somewhat overhyped. 
But step back and look at the numbers, and they still speak for themselves. Watt not only had 17.5 sacks in 2015 but also an extraordinary 50 quarterback hits, according to ESPN. His 29 tackles for a loss were most in the league, and six more than second-placed Khalil Mack. Meanwhile, there are starting defensive backs who could not equal his eight passes defensed. 
It is always hard to compare players at different positions, and both Josh Norman and Luke Kuechly merit consideration. So, too, does Watt's fellow defensive lineman Aaron Donald, who shone even while Chris Long and Robert Quinn were missing time through injury for the Rams. It is a much tighter contest than last year, but for me Watt is still the right choice. 

Offensive rookie of the year
Yes, he missed three games, and, yes, he had some bad games, but Todd Gurley was magnificent at his best, rampaging through defenses with a power and explosiveness that made you jump out of your seat. Despite the lost weeks, he still finished third in the league for rushing yards, with a 4.8 yard average per attempt and 10 touchdowns to his name. 

Defensive rookie of the year
The most passes defensed in the league, plus the joint-most interceptions, make Marcus Peters a clear choice despite strong competition from the also excellent Ronald Darby. I doubt very much that Peters's numbers look so good next year, because teams will know better than to throw his way so often. 

Coach of the year
There is a part of me (my furiously jerking knee, perhaps) that wants to give this award to Gary Kubiak. It would have to be shared with Wade Phillips - whose defense ranked first in the league during the regular season and then stepped up another notch to overwhelm Tom Brady in the AFC Championship Game - but the head coach deserves his slice of the credit for keeping the Broncos on track for the Super Bowl despite a distinctly undesirable situation at quarterback. 
Whether coaxing the best out of an ageing and injured Peyton Manning in an offensive system that the quarterback did not appear to relish, or baby-stepping Brock Osweiler through his first NFL starts, Kubiak had nothing but uncertainty at the most important position on the field. 
A large portion of his team's fanbase, plus the local media, thought Kubiak had made the wrong call in going back to Manning at the start of the playoffs. The events of the past fortnight have validated his decision. And I think I might have just talked myself into a decision. With apologies to Ron Rivera, this award does go Kubiak's way. 

Best plays of the year
In reverse order ... 
5) Ricardo Lockette goes over the head of a defender to reel in a glorious 40-yard touchdown on the flea-flicker. (And while we're talking trick plays, how about an honourable mention for Tom Brady's second career catch.) 
4) As East Great Falls's Coach Marshall would put it, " you don't score, until you score ". Kam Chancellor reminded Calvin Johnson of that lesson as he punched the ball out of Calvin Johnson's hands at the goal-line to preserve Seattle's victory over Detroit.
3) Carson Palmer spin move, Larry Fitzgerald stiff arm, mad Brazilian commentary. What more could you want with a playoff game on the line?
2) I couldn't really pick between Odell Beckham Jr's one-handed grab against Washington, and his astonishing sideline body control against Miami, so I stuck them both in for good measure. 
1) Likewise, Aaron Rodgers had given us several Hail Mary throws to choose from by the time Green Bay finally bowed out. But I still say the original was the best.

Worst play of the year
The one where Chuck Pagano mistook Griff Whalen for a center.

Brownsiest play of the year
                     Kick Six.

Best block by a quarterback
Michael Vick did do some things right.

Most sensitive bottoms
The NFL's mission to achieve greater media exposure in Britain took a step forward, although possibly not in the manner they had intended, when the New York Jets made national headlines by shipping 350 rolls of toilet paper over to London ahead of their International Series game against the Dolphins. This, on the advice of an intern who had visited the city previously, and reported back to his bosses that "the toilet paper was very thin because their plumbing isn't as good."

Biggest dreams
Chris Long.

Best Deflategate synopsis
South Park, obviously.

Best fan
                     Who Cat.

Least compelling controversy
                     People writing letters to newspapers to complain about Cam Newton enjoying himself while playing football.

Most compelling controversy
Did Mike Ditka fart on Monday Night Countdown?

Best team-mate
Regardless of his qualities as a backup quarterback, how could you not want Drew Stanton on your sideline?

Best celebration
Antonio Brown goes for the goalpost.

Weightiest moment
Dontari Poe becomes the new heaviest person ever to score a touchdown in the NFL.

Most embarrassing (but well-meaning) parent
JJ Watt's mother, Connie, who called repeatedly through the evening to make sure he was really OK after he made a tackle with no helmet against Kansas City, and later advertised her son to future partners on Entertainment Tonight. "I think JJ would make such a great catch for anybody, because he is a true down-home person who has such a good heart."

Best Steve Smith-ism
A toss-up, this year, between his words of warning to Santa Claus - "You come down my chimney in the middle of the night, that's going to be your last delivery" - and explanation for speedy recovery times - "I have a great nutritionist I'm sleeping with. Which is my wife."

Worst dab
                     Chris Berman or Greg Olsen.

Best performance art
Delvin Breaux captures the spirit of the Saints' defense perfectly with this parody of pass coverage against Tampa Bay.

Biggest troll
Rex Ryan was quick to get one over on his former employers, signing IK Enemkpali for the Bills one day after the linebacker had been waived by the Jets in the wake of the locker room scuffle that left Geno Smith with a broken jaw. The coach then named Enemkpali as a co-captain for New York's visit in November. 
Honourable mention: Taylor's Bakery in Indiana put together a fine line of DeflateGate cakes and cookies when the Patriots came to visit.

Best international perspective
                     Jarryd Hayne's debut as viewed from Australia. Yeah, that's a piece from our own site. And it's tremendous. 

Pick Six contest
And finally a note for regular readers who participate in the Pick Six contest: I will be posting the overall standings in the comments section below shortly. Until then, I can tell you that all 15 people who boasted a perfect record going into the conference championship games picked the Patriots to win, so it's once again a wide open race at the top.

James Murdoch returns as Sky chairman; 
Rupert Murdoch's younger son stepped down from the pay-TV group in 2012 in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal.

Mark Sweney.

James Murdoch is to return to Sky as chairman, almost four years after stood down in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal.
Murdoch, who was chief executive then chairman from 2003 until 2012, replaces Nick Ferguson, who stands down after 12 years.
Murdoch, who is currently a Sky non-executive director, stepped down from the then BSkyB because of the fallout from his role as chairman of News International, publisher of the Sun, Times and now defunct News of the World.  
At the time Murdoch said he felt it right to stand down as chairman of Sky - which is 39.1% owned by Rupert Murdoch's Fox- to avoid becom a "lightning rod" for the phone-hacking scandal.
"I would like to thank Nick for his outstanding contribution to the board over the last decade and more. I am proud to have been asked by the board to serve as chairman of Sky, one of the world's leading pay TV companies," said Murdoch.
