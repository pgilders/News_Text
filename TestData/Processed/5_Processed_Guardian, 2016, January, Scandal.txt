Can call centre therapy solve the NHS mental health crisis?; 
Fast-track treatment aims to ease growing problem in the UK, but critics say it is the clinical equivalent to online dating.

Robert Booth.

An NHS counsellor lets out a deep sigh as she puts the phone down. Her latest caller has revealed a further bout of self-harming. She fans her face to cool down after another tough counselling session on the frontline of Britain's mental health crisis. 
This cramped call centre in an industrial park in west Oxford is one of dozens of locations where the NHS is finally starting to grapple on a mass scale with illnesses such as depression and anxiety. 
The despair caused by a largely hidden national problem spills from the phone lines daily, and this team of 30 counsellors gets frequent reports of suicidal feelings. Patients include everyone from stressed Oxford dons and high-flying students to landscape gardeners and harassed mothers. Problems range from "social anxiety, behavioural avoidance, phobia of toilet, wine".

This is no fringe issue in the health of the nation. The NHS believes people with mental health problems die 15 to 20 years earlier than the average, but the system is struggling to cope. Lord Layard, a government adviser on mental health, identified mental health problems as "the biggest causes of misery in Britain today", with an estimated 6 million people affected.
Inpatient wards for the most serious mental illnesses are overflowing, with bed occupancy rates at 138% in some places (achieved by using the beds of patients who are on leave for new admissions). Thousands of patients have to be sent for treatment outside their local area each year, a practice linked to suicide, the rate of which is rising, particularly among men. 
Meanwhile 40% of mental health trusts saw spending cuts over the past two years and fewer than one in eight people who suffered a mental health crisis said they received appropriate care in 2015, according to the Care Quality Commission. The regulator concluded this was "unsafe and inherently unfair".
The Oxford call centre is part of the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme, which hopes to make therapy free on the NHS for low-intensity mental illness where previously medication was almost the only option. At the Oxford branch, 50 therapists handle 6,000 cases a year, and the workload is rising by 1,000 cases a year. The centre provides cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) courses by phone and online, as well as group and individual therapy. 
IAPT is rooted in the idea that treating anxiety and depression early can prevent more serious mental illness and can keep people working, saving about £7bn as year. 
The system is designed to be cheap and relatively quick, but that has led to one critic describing it as "the clinical equivalent to online dating". The national IAPT caseload of 1.3 million patients is 50% higher than envisaged when it was proposed a decade ago. The strain shows. Only about one in five people who undergo treatment enjoy a reliable recovery, according to NHS data, and about 40% of those who start courses drop out.
Several counsellors have told the Guardian that IAPT is a clumsy cure-all for complex and profound traumas, and that its tick-box approach to mental health problems can be "dangerous" and "distressing". But for others it works.
Rikki, 53, a married father of two from Oxfordshire, says he was on the verge of suicide when he went to his GP. He was eventually referred for IAPT services and did a CBT course followed by a mindfulness course. 
The techniques Rikki learned through IAPT gave him some means to cope. "It opened a door," he said. "It was like going outside and breathing fresh air. It gave me tools to handle the way that I feel."
Rikki had a long history of depression, including feeling suicidal in his teens, having a breakdown when he worked as an ambulance paramedic after attending repeated cot deaths, and most recently working as an environmental health officer. He started to have feelings of "deep failure" related to his work and became suicidal.
Work is a recurring theme, and at least a third of cases at Oxford IAPT appeared to be triggered by work stress, a phone counsellor estimated.
Another person who was feeling suicidal and offered a group CBT course in Oxford, is Anna, 42. A high achiever when younger, she had not been working and was living in a shared house where people were using drugs and not paying their rent.
"There was a lot of stress, and there were family problems and I was caught in the middle of it," she said. "I was pleased I was being given a free course and it was somewhere to go each week and that was really important for me. It was structure and it got me out."
Nevertheless, opinion is divided over IAPT's value, and data on the system's impact points to significant failings. Each therapist has about 300 patients a year. A census in 2014 showed there were 4,315 full-time equivalent qualified IAPT therapists against a government target of 6,000.
The dropout rate is high. In 2014-15, 450,000 people referred to IAPT never entered treatment, while only 37% of those that did completed their course. The effectiveness is also in doubt: 815,665 people entered treatment last year and only 180,300 enjoyed a "reliable recovery".

A psychologist working in a London IAPT as a one-to-one therapist said: "More and more we are seeing a revolving door because people who weren't getting what they need are coming back." 
Her caseload includes victims of trafficking and people from Africa and Sri Lanka who have suffered war trauma including multiple rape.
"IAPT has been set up to apply CBT to first cases of anxiety and depression, but the cases coming through are far more complex," she said on condition of anonymity. "People have long histories of complex trauma. It is massively oversimplifying mental health."
Dr Jay Watts, a clinical psychologist and psychotherapist who was involved in the IAPT pilot in Newham, east London, said the demand for a quick decision on a patient's condition was "incredibly dangerous".
"To ask for help is a massive moment in your life and so for five out of six people not to get what they need from IAPT and not to be able to get other referrals because all the money has gone to IAPT is a real national scandal," she said.
One of her patients had attended IAPT and was told she had an anger problem. There was no time to explore her home life, where she was being beaten by her boyfriend. The combination of the abuse and the IAPT clinic focusing on her anger rather than its cause, led her to feel trapped and that she was to blame for her problems. She attempted to take her own life.
Dr Elizabeth Cotton, a former NHS psychotherapist who is studying working practices in mental health, said IAPT services were the clinical equivalent to online dating. "You are given 30 minutes to get to grips with complex and often hopeless situations, lie about what you can do and walk away from human tragedy without a care in the world," she said. 
"Work is standardised to the extent that if a patient does not pick up the phone for an initial assessment within a 15-minute allotted time period, they are referred back to their GP. There is hatred for the patient that keeps us on the phone too long, making it impossible to meet the quota of eight satisfied clients a day. Reaching the quota involves not listening to the real and deteriorating situation of patients."

IAPT is in its eighth year and the NHS acknowledges problems on waiting times and recovery rates. It said in a statement: "There is more work to do to support some areas. Peer support from commissioning groups who are taking an exemplary approach is helping improve other services." It also said it was investigating why people from black and ethnic minority communities have lower recovery rates and why older people underuse the service.
Powerful voices are calling for much greater funding of the system. Paul Farmer, chief executive of Mind, who also chairs the NHS mental health taskforce which is due to shortly unveil a proposed five-year strategy, said waiting lists are too long for more specialist treatments, causing more people to attempt suicide.
"While IAPT's scope is expanding, it still mostly focuses on providing treatment for depression and anxiety," he said. "We have heard cases of people waiting upwards of two years or more for specialist treatment. While we know CBT can be the right treatment for many people, it isn't suitable for everyone."
Norman Lamb, the Liberal Democrat MP who as health minister in the coalition government championed IAPT, described it as "a massive and world-leading advance in evidence-based treatment" and said that to pick on faults was a disservice to the programme's achievements.
Rikki is in no doubt about where he stands on his life after treatment: "With my family, it was like there was a box around them and I couldn't get to them. Now I have a relationship with them and I'm loving it."

RuPaul: the Drag Race host shares his favourite TV; 
Featured shows include How To Get Away With Murder, Naked And Afraid, and anything with Angela Lansbury.

Gwilym Mumford.

Unmissable show?
Aside from Judge Judy and Jeopardy, I also love a show here in America called The Profit, which is about an entrepreneur who goes in and fixes failing businesses. I also love How To Get Away With Murder and Scandal and Empire. And there's a survival show over here called Naked And Afraid. Every night before I go to bed I have DVDs of Murder, She Wrote, and I realised that it's very similar to Judge Judy in that it's about figuring out a problem so that the truth is uncovered. That's a common theme in the things that I like. It's why The Profit and Naked And Afraid appeal to me. You have to break things down to the bare bones to build them back up again. 

Earliest TV memory?
Watching Diana Ross and the Supremes perform on The Ed Sullivan Show. It must have been 1965. It was fantastic.

Bring back...
Unfortunately, most of the cast are dead now but I'd love to see The Golden Girls  brought back. I'd love to see Murder, She Wrote, too. Angela Lansbury is such a watchable, wonderful actress. Even her scenes with no dialogue are compelling.

TV turn off?
I don't like practical jokes. I don't like when someone is being made fun of and they're not aware that it's a ruse. I've never been a victim myself but I have been ambushed by zoo radio people. What was the practical joke they played on me? Oh, I don't know. I've forgotten. I've moved on.

Pitch us a TV show...
How about Celebrity Drag Race ? I don't think I need to go any further! You've got it! Drag doesn't change who you are, it actually reveals who you are, so it would be interesting to see how those personas emerge.

Mastermind specialist subject?
Pop music. I love the Stock, Aitken and Waterman era when they ruled the charts, and my favourite song of theirs is Take Me To Your Heart by Rick Astley.

Catherine McGregor says Australian of the Year nomination raises 'trans visibility'; 
Senior military officer and cricket commentator says if she wins she will 'get a campaign going' to raise awareness about gender dysphoria.

Staff and agencies.

When Catherine McGregor, the world's most senior transgender military officer, says she's just happy to be nominated for Australian of the Year, she means it.
 Related:  World's most senior transgender military officer says she was surprised by sexism
Not simply for the honour of being recognised as a leading advocate for the country's transgender community. 
But because four years earlier, on 25 January 2012, she had planned to die.
"I was at Adelaide Oval and by the most slender thread, I didn't go back to my hotel room and end my life," the Toowoomba-born nominee said.
She had spent decades living as Malcolm McGregor - an army Lieutenant Colonel with three East Timor operations under his belt.
Malcolm was respected, successful and happily married. But living as a man, McGregor told Guardian Australia last year, had made her feel like an "out-of-tune orchestra".
"Now I look back on my hypermasculine period - doing all the tough-guy stuff - and realise that was role play," the 59-year-old explained.
It was a role she eventually abandoned in 2012 to start the psychologically, physically and hormonally arduous process of transitioning to a woman.
But what followed was a "blissful" realisation of her true feminine identity, the well-known cricket commentator said.
Becoming Catherine marked a new chapter in an already compelling story - one that's brought National Press Club addresses and now the Queensland nomination for Australian of the Year.
McGregor said she is keenly aware of the nomination's importance to enhancing "trans visibility" at a time when cultural touchstones like Caitlyn Jenner and The Danish Girl are raising awareness about gender dysphoria.

"If I'm successful, I'm going to get a campaign going," she pledged.
The former sex discrimination commissioner Elizabeth Broderick, the New South Wales nominee for Australian of the year, said she had not finished her work.
Broderick will return to her gender equality mission after Australia Day, having taken a break when she stepped down as commissioner in September last year.
"It's work that feeds my soul, makes my heart sing," she said.
She has begun working on increasing women's representation across the Australian federal police, where less than 35% of members are women and less than 20% of leadership roles or uniformed positions.
"I'm really excited about that work, it builds off my experience with the military," Broderick said.
In her most notable work as commissioner for eight years, Broderick led a wide-ranging review into the treatment of women in the Australian defence force after the Skype sex scandal.
Broderick, who has set up social media accounts under the moniker "getbrodericked", has also been a key advocate for Australia's paid parental leave scheme and worked extensively with the business sector to tackle sex discrimination in the workplace.
South Australian burns surgeon John Greenwood has been nominated in recognition of his development of innovative skin substitute products.
His fledgling Royal Adelaide hospital mobile burns unit was one of the key responders after the Bali bombings.
"That was a bit of a torrid time but it sort of threw burns injuries into the public eye and made it more important for a while," he said.
"Because of the charitable donations that came in after Bali and the profile that burns injuries received... I managed to achieve all of my goals for 10 years in about six months."
His solution involves an expandable synthetic seal which is inserted into the wounds left when a burn is removed, acting as a platform for composite skin grown in the laboratory.
The support allowed Dr Greenwood to focus attention on a pressing dilemma - how to provide quality but affordable treatment for patients with life-threatening burns. 
Barrister Julian McMahon, who fought tirelessly to try and save the lives of Bali Nine members Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, is Victoria's nomination for Australian of the Year.
A fierce opponent of the death penalty and a defender of human rights, he has worked to save the lives of Australians facing the death penalty overseas for the past 13 years, since he represented Van Tuong Nguyen in Singapore in 2002.
He studied law in Melbourne and first decided he wanted to become a lawyer while in secondary school in Sydney.
"As a teenager I definitely developed an interest in law watching Rumpole of the Bailey," McMahon said. 
He said the long, drawn-out death penalty cases do take their toll but he just has to "get on with it".
"I would say that lots of people have difficult or demanding jobs and lives, but what I do is nothing compared to lifetime carers of people suffering serious disabilities," he said.
"I just feel embarrassed when people say 'you're so amazing', when the fact is I'm doing my work the best I can and it's not as hard as what a lot of people have to do."
Tasmania's nominee, conservationist Jane Hutchinson, is head of the Tasmanian Land Conservancy, an non-government organisation which is one of the state's largest private landowners.
It buys land on which it will place a conservation covenant, before selling. "We wanted to create a new way of achieving nature conservation," Hutchinson said. 
As a lawyer she was initially recruited to draft a constitution for the TLC and has remained deeply involved ever since, including helping facilitate the legal acquisition of land returned to the Aboriginal community.
The TLC is also involved with the agricultural stewardship. "It meant that farmers could put nature on their balance sheet for the first time," Hutchinson said.
It was work from which every Australian would benefit, she added. "We are totally surrounded by nature and part of Australia's identity is nature."

Adidas to end sponsorship of IAAF over doping scandal - reports; 
∑ German sportswear giant had signed a contract until 2019 ∑ BBC reports decision could cost governing body millions of dollars.

Guardian sport.

Adidas has written to the IAAF to inform athletics' embattled governing body it is terminating its sponsorship deal three years early, according to reports. 
 Related:  Jessica Ennis-Hill wary of Russian athletes competing at Rio Olympics
The German sportswear company signed an 11-year agreement with the International Association of Athletics Federations in 2008 reported to be worth around £23m. But the BBC reported that the ongoing doping and corruption scandal has prompted Adidas to reportedly inform the IAAF that it will be pulling out of the deal. 
Adidas would only say that it "has a clear anti-doping policy. Therefore, we are in close contact with IAAF to learn more about reform process".
According to the report, the move will result in tens of millions of dollars in lost income. The BBC claims the IAAF was told Adidas was considering ending its relationship with them in November after the publication of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) Independent Commission's first report, which detailed claims of "state sponsored doping" within Russia.
The BBC, citing anonymous sources, said the sponsorship deal, signed in November 2008, was worth around $8m (£5.61m) per year. 
The IAAF said it was in close contact will all its sponsors and partners as it embarked on reform.
Adidas is one of the IAAF's "Official Partners" along with Canon, Toyota, Seiko, TDK, TBS and Mondo.

Why are some British newspapers still denying climate change?; 
Editors of the Mail, Express, Times, Sun and Telegraph should put the interests of their readers first by reporting the real facts about global warming.

Bob Ward.

Why are so many British newspaper editors still serving up unscientific climate change denial to their readers, even though the governments of more than 190 countries - including the UK - agreed in Paris last month that urgent action is required to avoid dangerous impacts from rising greenhouse gas levels? While the overall coverage in the Guardian, Independent and Mirror titles tends to reflect the mainstream scientific, economic and political consensus about climate change, the Mail, Express, Times, Sun and Telegraph titles all continue to use their opinion columns and leaders to try to cast doubt on the risks. This was plainly shown by the contrasting reports last month of the link between climate change and this winter's flooding. However, not all of the naysayers are the same, with some science and environment correspondents valiantly battling to serve the best interests of their readers with fact-based reporting about climate change.  
Sadly, it appears that some of these newspapers are now carrying out a cull of writers who choose not to reflect the uninformed prejudices of their editors and proprietors. Last summer, the environment editor of the Sun, Ben Jackson, left the newspaper and was not replaced. This was the culmination of a slow slide in the newspaper's coverage of climate change and other environmental problems since James Murdoch left its parent company, News International (now News UK), in the wake of the phone hacking scandal. 
Murdoch junior, unlike his father, is acquainted with the scientific evidence for climate change, and had persuaded his stable of newspapers to recognise the importance to their readers of being better informed about environmental issues. Since his departure, however, the editors of the Times and the Sun have fully embraced unscientific denial of climate change. Soon after losing its environment specialist, the Sun published an article from "climate expert", James Delingpole, a notorious rightwing polemicist whose lack of scientific knowledge was cruelly exposed on national television by the president of the Royal Society. And the Times has been providing Viscount Ridley, the former chair of Northern Rock bank, with a regular column to downplay the risks of climate change. Meanwhile, the Daily Telegraph also decided last summer to make redundant Geoffrey Lean, one of the UK media's most experienced voices on the environment. Lean wrote on his blog : "In the British press... there [are], in my estimation, some 10 columnists who reject or underplay the dangers of global warming, with precious few columnar voices on the other side". Fortunately, the Daily Telegraph still retains an environment correspondent, and at least occasionally publishes well-informed contributions to "balance" the babbling nonsense on climate change that appears in its columns by famous non-scientists such as Boris Johnson and Charles Moore. But it is readers of the Mail on Sunday and the Daily Express who suffer the most, with drivel appearing on both their news and comment pages. The Mail on Sunday has published a series of articles by David Rose, under the campaign banner of "The Great Green Con", which attempt to undermine confidence in climate science in a very clumsy and unconvincing way, including stories that have been based on a fake magazine cover he found on the internet and a typographic error on a website. Nevertheless, it is the Daily Express which has the worst track record, mixing ideological propaganda and inaccurate journalism. For instance, on 20 January, the United States National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, Nasa and the UK Met Office all announced that they had independently found 2015 to be the warmest year globally since records began in the 19th century. The online report by the Daily Express, under the headline "What Global Warming? USA temperatures DOWN as climatologists claim 2015 was hottest year," reflected the talking points handed out by climate change sceptics. Written by Jon Austin, who describes himself on Twitter as "Science & Paranormal Correspondent", it stated: "Todays [sic] announcement that a major developed nation like the US did not experience its hottest year ever is likely to fuel the argument put forward by many US-based climate sceptics that human activities simply do not have the level of impact being claimed by the climate change lobby." This is bunkum. The contiguous United States, not including Alaska and Hawaii, covers less than 2% of the Earth's surface and recorded  its second highest annual average temperature in 2015, just behind 2012. The United States is warming, just like the rest of the world. It should be noted that the Daily Express struggles with its coverage of weather as well as climate. On 10 January, the newspaper's website reported the impending arrival of a few days of seasonal weather under the headline: "Arctic SNOWBOMB to smash into Britain: Coldest winter in 58 YEARS now just days away." In fact, the meteorological winter (December, January and February) of 1957-58 was not particularly cold, and 22 of the UK's winters since then have recorded lower average temperatures. Given that last month was the warmest December on record in the UK by a considerable margin, and that the first half of January was also mild, this prediction by the Daily Express appears to be little more than uninformed speculation. When will editors of the Daily Express and other British newspapers abandon their daft crusade to promote climate change denial, and instead put the best interests of their readers first by reporting the real causes and potential consequences?

Catch-up and download: from Chelsea Does... to Courting Controversy; 
Chelsea Handler gets serious(ish) in her new documentary series on Neflix while the BBC's most contentious content is now available on its online store.

Gwilym Mumford.

TV: Chelsea Does...
Comedian Chelsea Handler has a busy 2016 planned. Later in the year she debuts a late night-style talkshow on Netflix (a curious platform for the genre). Before that comes this loose documentary series that sees Handler tackle a hefty topic each episode, from racism to technology. Obviously this isn't The Cook Report; Handler's angle is irreverent rather than searching, and her guests include KhloÈ Kardashian and American Pie's Jason Biggs, but there are also some more serious figures featured, including the Reverend Al Sharpton and former president of Israel Shimon Peres. 
                                            Netflix                                        

Audio: Reasonable Doubts
Another week, another true-crime podcast. This five-part series comes from WBUR, Boston's National Public Radio (NPR) station, and concerns a Massachusetts man who has spent 30 years in prison for a murder he claims he didn't commit. Like Netflix's Making A Murderer it features extensive allegations of massive institutional corruption, including doctoring of evidence. Likely to make your blood boil.

TV: Mad Dogs
Another UK show handed an unlikely US remake, Sky 1's black comedy Mad Dogs does at least have an easily adaptable premise: four middle-aged blokes head abroad to celebrate their mate's retirement, only to find themselves dragged into crime and corruption. This Amazon remake, a successful product of its pilot scheme, boasts a solid cast, including Billy Zane, Michael Imperioli (Christopher from The Sopranos) and Ben Chaplin (who also appeared in the British version), as well as The Shield creator Shawn Ryan on exec-producer duties.

The Comic Strip trains its eye on the hacking scandal and manages to get a decent smattering of its shots on target.

The BBC Store offers a nice range of editorially curated collections, spanning factual, drama and comedy. The best of the bunch is Courting Controversy, which features boundary-pushing dramas from the past half-century. Some, like Cathy Come Home and Threads, have passed into telly folklore; others, such as Dennis Potter's once-banned Brimstone And Treacle, about the devil arriving in suburbia, remain curios. All are worthy of your attention, and can be bought for £3.99 a piece.

Donatella Versace opens Paris fashion week with sporty couture; 
A collection which taps into 'ath-evening' and shows a designer tapped into reality and current trends.

Imogen Fox.

On Sunday night Donatella Versace, a pocket-rocket of a designer from Milan, opened the haute couture shows in Paris with a collection that was both modern and rooted in reality. Well, at least as much rooted in reality as it is possible to be when talking about evening dresses costing more than £10,000.
Her collection was named "Athletic Couture" and featured dresses with ergonomic lines which traced the models' curves, harness straps and white ski pants and matching zip tops highlighted with orange go-faster stripes all of which could loosely be termed sporty. Before the show the designer said: "I was thinking about women at their most focused and dynamic ... women who push themselves to the limit." 
Dreams and magic, rather than focus and dynamism, are the more usual vernacular of couture. But this collection tapped into the modern trend of "ath-evening" - wearing posh tracksuit bottoms with high heels or shoulder baring tops with racer backs which recall performance sportswear, to a swanky evening event. It's a concept which rejects the fusty notion that a gilt edged invitation demands the kneejerk response of a floor length, cocktail dress. That feels a bit too Nancy Reagan-era White House for now. In this context it was refreshing to see a designer using current trends to influence even the highest levels of a brand's design repertoire. It was a move that younger couture customers - looking for something that little bit more relevant - will appreciate. 
So much about the world of haute couture celebrates the past. Dresses as weighed down with an over-reverance to the history of les petits mains and the workmanship of the ateliers as they are with bugle beads and crystals.
Much of the big names on couture schedule are designed by men - the world of couture can feel very backward sometimes.
But Donatella's Versace is different. In couture terms the brand is an ariviste (it rejoined the couture rosta only four years ago). What is more the designer's approach feels modern and open. The Versace family has been no stranger to scandals in the past but Donatella's Versace is one where knowing irony lives happily alongside high glamour and sexually charged designs. Look up her Instagram account if you are unconvinced. 
The designer herself was at pains to highlight Versace's modern point of difference. She noted that "couture is not about the past, it is a living tradition." To emphasis this still further the designer had used silicone gel throughout the collection - a forward-thinking kind of couture decoration which looked as if a spirograph had been involved.
Chunky crystal ropes (which recalled those sugary shoelace sweets) were knotted and threaded in and out of evening gowns. Flashes of highlighter orange and neon yellow - the sort of colours seen on performance trainers - were a motif throughout the show. There was a catsuit with ski-pant stirrups and a white evening gown which looked as if a neon yellow swimsuit was worn underneath. 
Dynamism, strength and athleticism may have been the starting point, but there was plenty of femininity too. Supermodels dressed in cobalt blue and acid tangerine dresses wearing four inch heels can never really be accurately described as looking ready to compete in track and field. The couture levels of craftsmanship and technical accomplishment of the atelier were also keen to be highlighted by the Versace team - journalists were briefed that one crochet dress took a month to complete. 
Summing up the show the designer said: "This collection is one of the most complicated, sophisticated and technically accomplished that we have ever created." Like the evening wear design her clients will likely lap up, Donatella Versace is not about modesty. Nor should she, or they, be.

Victims' law could boost rights to challenge crime investigation process; 
Keir Starmer's bill would extend right to question decisions and create duty for public workers to report suspected abuse.

Owen Bowcott Legal affairs correspondent.

Victims' rights to challenge decisions over criminal investigations would be strengthened and a duty to report suspected child abuse created under a bill introduced by the former director of public prosecutions, Sir Keir Starmer.
                     The victims' of crime bill, brought in by the Labour MP, has already attracted cross-party support, including from former Conservative ministers. It is due to receive its second reading on Friday.
 Related:  Labour publishes proposals for victims' law 
At the last election, the Tories also promised to introduce a victims' law but that has yet to appear. Starmer hopes the government may adopt his draft legislation. 
The former DPP's private members' bill has been developed in Labour party reviews and is in consultation with the anti-stalking charity Voice4Victims. Its main purposes are to provide a right of appeal against a decision to stop a criminal investigation; to establish a duty to report suspected child abuse by those working in regulated professions such as healthcare and teaching; and to require victims' services plans to be set up for each police area.
Victims already have the right to review Crown Prosecution Service decisions not to prosecute but Starmer's bill would extend that right to question police decisions. The duty to notify police of suspected sexual abuse of a child has been widely discussed in the wake of successive child abuse scandals in schools and care homes.
Starmer said: "Victims' rights will only be taken seriously when they are enshrined in law. This is a radical, comprehensive bill that would ensure victims are better supported, listened to and treated fairly.
"Victims should be at the heart of our criminal justice system. At the moment, though, too many victims are afraid to come forward and most victims who do say they wouldn't come forward again. That has to change, and this bill would make sure it does.
"The government has a manifesto commitment to introduce a victims' bill but is yet to do so. I hope the government sees this bill not as a challenge but as an invitation. It has been drafted after wide-ranging consultation with victims and represents their gold standard. I urge the government to now take it forward."

                     Claire Waxman, founder of Voice4Victims, said: "As a stalking victim, I experienced appalling treatment and re-victimisation at the hands of our criminal justice system. I naively believed that the system would help victims, however, I soon learned that it compounds their trauma. 
"The system discounts victims' needs and rights in order to cut corners and save time and money. Victims have to deal with the ordeal of a crime and when they try to access justice and support, more often than not, this journey is littered with many avoidable errors. These errors are detrimental, not only to the justice process but also the victim's emotional wellbeing and ability to recover from the crime." 
                     Harry Fletcher, criminal justice director at the Digital-Trust, said: "There is also an urgent need for the establishment of a professional body to regulate victim services and to have powers to investigate and act on victims' complaints. These necessary reforms would ensure that proper quality standards were in place and that victims had redress."
Co-sponsors of the bill include the former Conservative children's minister Tim Loughton, the Green party MP Caroline Lucas , the Conservative former solicitor general Sir Edward Garnier, the Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville Roberts and the Labour MPs Sarah Champion, Jenny Chapman and Barry Sheerman.

Drunk Stoned Brilliant Dead: The Story of The National Lampoon
9pm, Sky Atlantic
At its height, National Lampoon was the second-most popular magazine on US newsstands: less a satirical organ than one big coked-up party for the Me Decade. In this rather brittle tribute, writers, actors and editors tell its story, from its Nixon-baiting origins, to status as something of a real-life Animal House for everyone from the future cast of Saturday Night Live (who plundered its talent wholesale) to future film director John Hughes.

EU policymakers seek power to fine carmakers for anti-pollution cheating; 
European commission wants ability to fine (EURO)30,000 for each rule-breaking car, as the EU tries to crack down after the VW emissions scandal.

Jennifer Rankin in Brussels.

EU authorities want the power to impose big fines on carmakers who cheat anti-pollution rules, in the latest attempt to get to grips with the VW emissions scandal.
The European commission wants to fine carmakers up to (EURO)30,000 (£22,600) for each rule-breaking car they produce, according to a draft law that will be published on Wednesday. 
The EU's industry chief, Elzbieta Bienkowska, said the proposals, along with parallel plans to overhaul car emissions tests, marked a turning point in how the EU regulated the car industry. 
"It is a huge difference from what we have now," she said. "Life for them will never be the same again." 
Although the proposals still have to be go through the EU's labyrinthine lawmaking process, they reveal how some policymakers are seeking to get tough on the car industry in the wake of the VW scandal. 
 Related:  VW rejects call to compensate European drivers over emissions scandal
VW was plunged into turmoil, after it admitted that 11m cars worldwide had been designed to cheat emissions tests. The defeat devices meant that close to 1m tonnes of extra air pollution was spewed into the atmosphere every year, roughly the same as the UK's combined emissions for all power stations, vehicles, industry and agriculture. 
But the crisis also caused angst among European regulators. Although most of the cars fitted with defeat devices were sold in Europe, it took a US authority to detect the scandal.
Bienkowska admitted the EU was "completely helpless" when the scandal blew up last autumn. The commissioner, who is  battling VW for compensation for European consumers, said she would also like to see an overhaul of European consumer protection laws to bring them closer in line with US standards.
She vowed to continue to press the carmaker for compensation at a further meeting with its executives in February, although she has no power to make VW pay.
In the US, which has tougher consumer-protection laws, VW has agreed to pay $1,000 (£704) to 500,000 drivers, but is refusing to pay compensation to 8.5 million European drivers. 
One idea the car industry may find harder to resist is a proposal in the draft regulation to break the close ties between carmakers and laboratories that test vehicles. In most EU countries, although not the UK, carmakers are able to shop around the emissions-testing labs.
"The car manufacturer can go to any [testing service] to check which one is better for their purposes," said Bienkowska. "We think there is a conflict of interest." 
The VW scandal also exposed the open secret that cars tested in a lab tend to be given lower-emissions values, because the engine is worked less hard than in real life, as technicians tweak weight and air-resistance.
On Monday night Volkswagen's chief executive, Matthias M¸ller, said the gap between laboratory tests and real-world standards was no longer acceptable. 
"The industrywide discrepancies between official test results and actual usage is no longer tolerable," he said ahead of a meeting with EU officials in Brussels. "We, the industry, need to take a new path." 
But Rebecca Harms, a German member of the European parliament, voiced caution about seeing the VW scandal as a turning point. 
"The speech by Mr M¸ller said everything that had to be said... but whether we can believe it or not is still open."
The Green MEP, who has been involved in politics for a quarter of a century in Lower Saxony, the German state that has a 20% stake in VW, said the company was "a kind of empire in Germany", with strong support from politicians and trade unions. 
She said VW had done world-class research and development into low-emissions technology, including electric cars, but had chosen to focus on diesel engines. 
"They have the knowledge and capacities to contribute to a major change [in green-car technologies], but whether they believe they can sell it or not is another issue. So far they decided to protect dirty technologies."
Lawmakers in the European parliament fear the latest effort to regulate the car industry could be weakened by countries with powerful manufacturers, such as the UK, Germany and France. 
The EU's biggest member states already stand accused of watering down new emissions tests, ahead of a crucial vote by MEPs next week.

'There hasn't been match-fixing at Wimbledon,' says All England Club; 
Richard Lewis and Philip Brook, who run Wimbledon, are confident right measures are in place but concede more could still be done.

Kevin Mitchell at Melbourne.

If there is a brand in the professional sports industry that floats above the confusion below like an untouchable white cloud, it surely is Wimbledon. While football and athletics, for instance, struggle to contain the indiscipline in their upper management that has dragged both sports to the edge of the swamp, the home of tennis has been a green and purple oasis of propriety.
Philip Brook, the chairman of the All England Club, and his chief executive, Richard Lewis, would very much like to keep it that way.
Brook and Lewis landed in Melbourne on the weekend like a pair of country solicitors walking into some City scandal, as stories, rumours and counter-claims about match-fixing still raged through the first grand slam tournament of the year. 
The defending champion Novak Djokovic was the first to be traduced - and perhaps was still disturbed by unproven and old claims when he went into temporary meltdown against Gilles Simon. Then Australia's long-time hero Lleyton Hewitt had his farewell tournament wrecked by more allegations relating to matches so creaking that some journalists spent more time delving into the archives than watching live tennis.
Later a mixed doubles match at this Australian Open went into the dock - and out again, when it emerged the offshore betting company who had alerted one newspaper to suspect betting patterns had been very much a lone voice, probably looking for free publicity. True or fabricated, the rumours rumbled.
"It hasn't been the greatest week for the sport," Lewis said, "but I actually think that in the end it will be a good thing."
Brook said match-fixing was "high on the agenda" at a meeting here this week of tennis's leaders - representatives of all four grand slams, the ITF, ATP and WTA - "arranged, funnily enough, before any of this current issue was with us". They were open to learning from the experience, he said.
 Related:  Tennis match-fixing reports: authorities 'absolutely reject' any cover-up
"What you saw over the last 10 days actually is that the leadership of the sport worked pretty well together as a group," he said. "I think the messages coming out about tennis integrity, how we all feel about it, have been consistent."
As for the Tennis Integrity Unit - with which he has been associated for four years - he said: "We have to look seriously now at how we can improve what we already think is a good system. With the explosion of internet betting in particular, things have moved on."
Lewis chipped in: "Compared to 10 years ago, the level of education [of players] has increased dramatically and improved. There have been lots of quotes from players over the last week saying they know what to do. There is a lot of reporting going on and probably one of the areas for improvement is communication, explaining to the big wide world just how much is going on. In comparison to 10 years ago that is a big improvement."
When asked had there ever been match-fixing at Wimbledon, both responded: "Not to my knowledge."
Why has Wimbledon not been tainted?
"Some of it is to do with money," Brook said. "If you're playing a Futures event, or Challenger event, and you're trying to make your way in the sport, and finding it difficult and money is very hard to come by, it is on the face of it an easier market, let's put it that way, to go after if you're trying to corrupt somebody, rather than if you're trying to talk to somebody who's in the top 20. They're much more concerned about themselves and playing etcetera and success on the tennis court."
Asked would Wimbledon ever contemplate a commercial partnership with a betting company as the Australian Open have with William Hill, Brook said: "I think it's extremely unlikely - and that isn't to comment on anybody else. The thing to remember about Wimbledon is that we are a little bit different in lots of ways. Our whole commercial programme from start to finish is very different - how we manage it, present it - from any of the other grand slams. So a betting partner is very unlikely."
He added: "Some people are asking is the closeness of the sport to the betting companies a good thing or not? Some players have said it's a good thing, other people take a different view."
Including Andy Murray, who called it "hypocrisy".
One partnership Wimbledon has been committed to for nearly 80 years and which was extended last September to 2020 is that with the BBC. Did either of them feel "let down" when Radio 4 collaborated with Buzzfeed News last week in a broadcast investigation purporting to show a cover-up of match-fixing across the sport?
"We have to respect the independence of the BBC," Lewis said, "and their independence is something that has been talked about a lot in the past week - so it would be hypocrisy for us not to want the BBC to be independent.
"Personally, I thought that there were a couple of aspects of the report that were, in the cold light of day, questionable. I'm surprised the BBC used certain aspects.
"As we get into it and the dust settles, there will be one or two things that won't stand up and will be questioned. I can't even remember if they said a match had actually been fixed or there was just a questionable betting pattern. Did they actually say it had been fixed? I don't think they did."
Were the All England Club given much notice?
"A few days. Not much," Brook said.
Pressed on claims made in the programme that pointed the finger at 15 players in the draw here who had been under suspicion over the years - including in early rounds at Wimbledon - Lewis said: "My understanding of the analysis of the betting patterns was that it wasn't over the top or extreme. You can only go by what the professionals say but the investigators who looked into that were pretty confident that it was OK."
Brook added: "We all feel very strongly that it shouldn't be tennis's turn, that tennis hasn't done the things we've seen in other sports. But I think what's happening over the past 10 days makes us all realise we have to redouble our efforts in the good work we've been doing. We need to do more and we need to do better."
Brook said being open with the wider public about match-fixing remained problematic.
"It's a difficult area because, on the one hand we would love there to be more transparency but, if Nigel Willerton [head of the TIU] were in the room he would say, 'I can't give you that level of transparency because it would compromise the work my team are trying to do.'
"One of the main issues is trying to work out if there is a better way, a middle ground where there is more transparency about the work the unit is doing, while still allowing it to operate as effectively as it does. We feel there may be some things that can be done in that regard."
Lewis added: "We do put in extra resources and there are extra measures - but needless to say I don't want to go into too much detail. But yes, there are other areas, absolutely, where we put in above and beyond, not just in integrity."
Would it not make sense, meanwhile, to get the players on board in fighting match-fixing, to proactively co-opt them as part of the army hunting out the enemy, rather than laying in wait for the next dodgy shift in betting patterns?
"That's a very good point," Brook said. "They absolutely are in it with us and it's in absolutely nobody's interests for this to go on. We have seen in this last week the reaction of some of the players and how offended they've been actually by some suggestions."
Lewis added: "I think that's one of the good things that is coming out of it. Anti-doping has been talked about for years and is now not a secret. I came back into the sport in 2012 and I haven't met anybody who did not think there was a problem to be addressed. We are fighting the war, not a battle but a war. The fact it's come out in the public domain, OK, we would not have wished it to be like this - blah blah blah - it's definitely one of the good things that's come out of it. I think the players will respond well."
But what is the war? Do they know who the sport's enemies are?
 Related:  Tennis needs full transparency to preserve image after match-fixing claims
"I think we do," Lewis said. "Integrity is the bottom line, as Roger Federer said. It doesn't matter how much you pay for it, it's about your moral compass. There's no doubt doping was/is fairly easy to identify in terms of what it's about. And I think to a large extent this is. It's a legitimate leisure industry that at its edges can go wrong and the sport, all sports, need to protect themselves as much as possible about going wrong."
Reminded Adidas had just suspended its long-term sponsorship contract with IAAF because of suspected wrong-doing in dope-testing in Russia, Brook said: "I think we could learn something from it, yes. I think the problems are different. There have been suggestions over the last 10 days there has been a cover-up in tennis - and none of us recognise that as a possibility. You can argue whether there are enough resources in the unit to really stamp this out. That's a more interesting question. But I think therefore our problems are fundamentally different from other things we have seen in football and athletics."
Lewis concluded: "Funnily enough, and I'm sure this point has not been lost on you all already, but one of the perceived weaknesses of tennis, I think, in this instance is one of our strengths, in that there are so many organisations.
"If you look at some of the other sports, without naming, all the power in one sport has been in the hands of just a few people and they turn out to be corrupt. I think the whole dynamic of this sport is much more difficult, anyway, because there are four grand slams that are all pretty influential.
"Then there's the ITF, ATP and WTA. So any kind of collusion hasn't happened and it's much less likely to happen.
"But there are definitely lessons to be learned. You talk about Lance Armstrong, I remember at the time, there was widespread questioning about whether the sport actually wanted to find out what was going on. They just let a guy deny it and they accepted it. Well, that is absolutely not where tennis is at."

Russia's verdict on BBC's War and Peace: 'a classic with cleavage'; 
Critics in the Russian media respond with praise, amusement and raised eyebrows at the adaptation's more explicit scenes.

Jessica Elgot and Alec Luhn in Moscow.

Russian reviewers have responded with both praise and barely concealed amusement to the BBC's adaptation of War and Peace, with reviewers describing it as a "medium-budget soap opera" and a "classic with cleavage".
 Related:  War and Peace: the 10 things you need to know (if you haven't actually read it) 
One review of the Tolstoy adaptation starring Paul Dano and Lily James said eyebrows had been raised in Russia at the risque scenes. St Petersburg news website Fontanka.ru said one dress was so low cut, the actor's cleavage looked like it would "fall on the dinner plate".
Leo Tolstoy's four-volume novel set during Napoleon's 1812 invasion is deeply lodged in Russia's collective psyche, and it was once compulsory to read the 1,000-page book in schools. 
The BBC series, written by Andrew Davies and watched by 6 million viewers, has not yet aired in Russia, but many have sought out episodes online, Russian media reported. 
Many reviews commented on the decision by Davies and the BBC to skirt over many of the sprawling subplots and focus on the romance - including spotlighting the hints of an incestuous relationship between brother and sister Anatole and HÈlËne Kuragin.
"Andrew Davis immediately puts a little Game of Thrones into the sacred cow entrusted to him," a Novosibirsk culture site wrote in its review. "Viewers still have six hours of pondering the Russian soul, but at least with these two profligates everything should immediately be clear."
Davies admitted he had made the relationship more explicit by showing Tuppence Middleton and Callum Turner, who play the siblings, in bed together.
For at least one Russian tabloid, the scene did not go far enough. "The promised incest scene came in the first episode," wrote Komsomolskaya Pravda, offering a "hint of scandal".
"Anatole strokes his sister under a blanket," it continued. The "prim English evidently decided not to arouse the feelings of literature lovers" by "not showing the viewers everything".
                     Davies said it was crucial to include the incestuous relationship in his adaptation. "HÈlËne and Anatole are in an incestuous relationship, but Tolstoy indicates this so subtly that most readers, including me, at first reading, miss it altogether," he told the Radio Times.
"This relationship, and their attitude to it, is so crucial to our understanding of them that for me, at least, it needs to be on screen."
The author's great-great-grandson gave the BBC series his approval even though the "costumes and interiors don't always correspond with what Lev Nikolayevich (Tolstoy) had in the novel". 
Vladimir Tolstoy, a cultural advisor to president Vladimir Putin, singled out Paul Dano's portrayal of Pierre Bezukhov as "good acting work" and promised to watch the rest of the series.
"I welcome any attempt to adapt Tolstoy's works for the screen that is done with respect for the text and the author. I think the BBC's work is one of these," Tolstoy said.
"Of course, this film is a look at Russia, at the novel that is a bit unfamiliar for the Russian reader and viewer, but nonetheless it's done carefully enough in regards to the author of the text, in my opinion," he added.
Some critics compared the series unfavourably to Sergei Bondarchuk's 1966 version, which won an Oscar for best foreign-language film. 
Rossiiskaya Gazeta, a state-owned newspaper, said the BBC's version was "not a patch" on Bondarchuk's, and that it lacked reverence for Tolstoy's text. It described it as a "medium-budget soap opera" more focused on fawning beauties, glasses clinking and magnificent balls than on the philosophy of the human spirit and endurance.
Others welcomed a simpler, more erotic version to introduce non-readers and a younger audience to the sweeping saga, especially the charged sex scene between the married HÈlËne and her playboy lover Fedya Dolokhov.
"On a formally laid table, the cutlery shakes rhythmically ... the passionate Fedya Dolokhov, eyes shining insolently, thrusts himself upon [her]," said Fontanka.ru. "Now the great novel will not only be more accessible but also more interesting," the reviewer quipped.
Reviews in the UK also opined that the sexed-up series was not one to be taken too seriously. "Bosoms heaving? Sabres flashing? Lucrative foreign sales projected? Check, check, check," wrote the Guardian's Stuart Jeffries. 
In Russia, reviewers also praised Dano's performance as Pierre Bezukhov, with Meduza.ru calling it "the main success of the series ... an absolutely exact match and probably the most fleshed-out character."
Entertainment website Afisha was less positive about James as Natasha Rostova, saying she merely "wears a fringe and smiles in a cute way".
That verdict on James's performance is strikingly similar to that of the Telegraph's Serena Davies, who gave the series four stars but said James's performance was the "biggest concern: although she can flutter and flirt with the best of them, I doubt she's the tragedian required for the story's later chapters".
 Related:  War and Peace review - this silly Russian saga is a bit too English
The series is clearly aimed at those who have not read the book and are unlikely ever to do so, the Russian reviewer for Afisha continued, but conceded the series as a whole was "fresh, bombastic, beautiful and clever in a British way".
If there was a theme to the Russian criticism, it was that the series did not feel Russian enough, even the scenes filmed in St Petersburg, which Meduza.ru said was barely recognisable.
The feeling it evokes is "neither that of a Russian village, nor glittering St Petersburg, nor hospitable and extravagant Moscow", wrote Izvestia's reviewer. "The adaptation lacks the most important thing: atmosphere."
The Guardian's review drew the same conclusion. "The adaptation's biggest problem? It was too English. It took the deep-voiced Russian choruses that punctuated some scenes and the shots of CGI sailing ships frozen on the Neva, to remind me War and Peace was set not in Georgian England but tsarist Russia," Jeffries wrote.

Tesco delayed payments to suppliers to boost profits, watchdog finds; 
Groceries code adjudicator finds supermarket failed to pay back multi-million pound sums owed for up to two years, but regulator is unable to levy fine.

Sarah Butler.

The grocery market watchdog has ordered Tesco to make "significant changes" in the way it deals with suppliers after finding the supermarket had deliberately delayed payments to boost its profits.
Christine Tacon, the groceries code adjudicator (GCA), said Tesco had seriously breached the legally binding code governing the grocery market. She said some suppliers had to wait two years for millions of pounds owed by the grocer.

However, Tacon is unable to fine the supermarket as the breaches took place before her power to levy fines came into force in April last year. 
"I was troubled to see Tesco at times prioritising its own finances over treating suppliers fairly," Tacon said.
She added that she had seen internal emails suggesting payments should not be made ahead of a certain date in order to avoid missing targets promised to City investors. In some cases this occurred despite suppliers' requests for payment, at other times it was with their consent.
"The pressure on buyers and finance teams to meet margin targets was the overriding pressure within the business. It was widespread. It was everywhere," she said.
Tacon also criticised the company for unilaterally making deductions from invoice payments. Even when Tesco acknowledged a debt, Tacon said that on some occasions the money was not repaid for more than a year, or as long as two years.
The adjudicator launched the investigation in February last year after Tesco admitted it had overstated profits in a scandal that has also led to a Serious Fraud Office investigation.
Dave Lewis, Tesco chief executive, who joined the business in September 2014 just a few days before the accounting scandal emerged and was in post for only four months of the period investigated by Tacon, apologised to suppliers and said the retailer had now "fundamentally changed".
"Over the last year we have worked hard to make Tesco a very different company from the one described in the GCA report. The absolute focus on operating margin [under former boss Phil Clarke] had damaging consequences for the business and our relationship with suppliers," he said.
Tacon said Tesco had "acted unreasonably" by delaying payments to suppliers, often for lengthy periods and sometimes deliberately to support its profits ahead of key financial reporting periods. For example, a list of methods for meeting a half-year profit target seen by Tacon included "not paying back money owed". 
She considered Tesco's breach of the code to be serious because of the varied and widespread nature of the delays in payment. 
"The most shocking thing I found was how widespread it was. Every supplier I spoke to had evidence of delays in payments," Tacon said. 
One supplier was owed several million pounds as a result of price changes being incorrectly applied over a long period, but Tesco took two years to refund the money.
"The sums were often significant and the length of time taken to repay them was too long," she said at the launch of her 60-plus page report. 
While in some cases the delays were due to deliberate policy, Tacon found buyers were given "contradictory and unclear" guidance about the importance of hitting margin targets. Some delays were the result of poor administration and communication and Tesco had "inadequate processes" for correcting errors, for example where data had been input wrongly.

She has given the retailer a month to say how it plans to implement her recommendations, which include paying suppliers in accordance with agreed terms, correcting pricing errors within a week of notification by a supplier, and calling a halt to unilateral deductions from invoices. Suppliers will now have 30 days to challenge any proposed deduction.
The adjudicator also said Tesco must improve its invoices, making them clearer and more transparent for suppliers, and train its finance teams and buyers. She said many of the problems encountered related to unclear terms in Tesco's agreements with suppliers and deals not being put into writing - something she has referred to the competition watchdog, the CMA.
Tacon said many suppliers had reported an improvement in relations with Tesco since the period under investigation, June 2013 until February 2015.
She said she had found no evidence that Tesco had required suppliers to make payments to secure better shelf positioning or to increase the amount of space allocated to them on shelves.
However, she will now launch an industry-wide consultation examining payments made by suppliers in order to participate when Tesco reviewed the range of products stocked in a particular category or in order to be made a "category captain", where they could advise on how best to display products. Tesco also asked for "investment" from suppliers to help underpin profits in a particular category. Tacon said such payments could amount to tens or even hundreds of thousands of pounds per supplier.
Tacon said: "There were a range of practices that I am concerned could amount to an indirect requirement for payment [related to positioning of products on shelves], contravening the code." 
 Related:  Suppliers scared to blow the whistle on supermarkets
Lewis said: "In 2014 we undertook our own review into certain historic practices, which were both unsustainable and harmful to our suppliers. We shared these practices with the adjudicator, and publicly apologised. Today, I would like to apologise again. We are sorry. 
We accept the report's findings, which are consistent with our own investigation. 
He said Tesco had already implemented all the recommendations of the GCA and had completely changed its practices since January 2015. He said Tesco had also stopped asking for payments related to "category captain" status or range reviews, but the company would look at making further changes in the light of Tacon's planned consultation. 
"We have changed the way we work by reorganising, refocusing and retraining our teams and we will continue to work in a way which is consistent with the recommendations," Lewis said.
While Tesco could not be fined, it could have been required to take out newspaper advertisements laying out its apology. Tacon said she had not used this power as Lewis had publicly apologised and Tesco's suppliers gave evidence that dealings had now improved.
The supermarket must now report quarterly to the GCA on the measures she has asked it to introduce and Tacon can launch a new investigation if she finds her recommendations have not been followed through.
Anna Soubry, the business minister, said: "Christine Tacon has done a thorough and fearless investigation into a scandalous situation. Tesco say they have changed their practices and I very much hope they have. Paying smaller suppliers on time and treating them fairly is good and proper business. Late payment can hinder the growth and productivity of these suppliers and can threaten their existence."

 European markets rebound as oil recovers  
Volatile days are becoming the norm but even by those standards, the swings during the course of the day's trading were pretty notable.
A 6% slump in Chinese markets - partly driven by poor rail freight figures casting new doubt on the strength of the country's economy - got things off to a bad start. Oil was on the slide, falling back below $30 a barrel on continuing fears of a supply glut at a time when demand is weakening.
So European markets began with falls of nearly 2%. But a revival in the crude price came amid talk that Opec could be prepared to cut production if rival producers followed suit. That, along with some decent financial results from the likes of Procter & Gamble, set Wall Street off to a positive start and gave a lift to markets elsewhere. Ahead of Apple's latest figures later and the US Federal Reserve interest rate decision on Wednesday, the final scores in Europe showed: 

The FTSE 100 finished up 34.46 points or 0.59% at 5911.46, having fallen as low as 5771. Commodity companies led the rebound.
Germany's Dax added 0.89% to 9822.75
France's Cac closed 1.05% higher at 4356.81
Italy's FTSE MIB rose 1.51% to 18,923.83
Spain's Ibex ended 1.46% better at 8692.5
In Greece, the Athens market added 2.15% to 546.22
On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 285 points or 1.78% higher.
On that note, it's time to close up. Thanks for all your comments, and we'll be back again tomorrow.

 The slump in the oil price should theoretically be good for the global economy but stock markets at least do not seem to be taking that on board. Julian Jessop at Capital Economics says:
In principle, a lower oil price should be positive for the world economy. The transfer of income from producers to consumers, who are more likely to spend on other goods and services, should boost global demand. At worst, the impact might be expected to be neutral, with the winners offsetting the losers. In practice, though, the net impact of the recent slump in oil prices appears to have been negative, or at least perceived as such in financial markets.
There are a number of factors at play here. First, the speed and extent of the slump has itself added to the uncertainty about the global economy. Rightly or (more probably) wrongly, the fall has been interpreted as evidence of a collapse in demand and fuelled fears about a hard landing in China in particular.
Second, the costs to producers have been proportionately much larger (relative to their incomes) than the benefits to consumers. This concentration of losses relative to the more diffuse benefits is one reason why producers appear to have cut their spending more quickly and by a larger amount than consumers have increased theirs.

This asymmetry has compounded the negative impacts on financial markets. Energy companies may now only account, for example, for a small share of the US junk bond market, but the fear is that there will be widespread defaults throughout this sector, rippling through the financial system as a whole. Similarly, the impact on the 20% or so of the UK FTSE 100 accounted for by commodity producers is far more visible than the potential benefits to the remaining 80% who are not.
Pressure on oil producers to sell assets accumulated in Sovereign Wealth Funds has also soured the mood, even though this selling might actually boost the global economy if the proceeds are used to support local spending.
The additional downward pressure on headline inflation from lower energy costs has revived fears that vulnerable economies may slip into a more damaging period of deflation.
However, this analysis does also allow us to draw some more positive conclusions. Stabilisation in oil prices - even at a low level - should at least ease some of the associated uncertainty about the health of the global economy. The downward pressure on headline inflation should unwind too. Many of the negatives are also about timing. Producers have generally been quicker to adjust their spending, but eventually this should be outweighed by increases in spending by consumers on other goods and services.
On balance, then we continue to expect an extended period of lower oil prices to boost global growth over the next few years, even if this process may take longer than we had anticipated.
block-time published-time 4.06pm GMT 
 The recovery in the oil price has given a boost to stock markets and follows hopes that Opec would be willing to cut production if non-member countries - notably Russia - also agree to reduce supply. 
Iraqui oil minister Adel Abdel Mahdi said he saw some flexibility for a deal with rival producers, and as a consequence, Brent crude is now up 2.9% at $31.38. But given the recent volatility, the gains may not last long. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at online trading group IG, said:
As oil goes, so goes the rest of the market. Yesterday a rapid decline in crude paved the way for stock markets to give up their gains, but today the price of black gold is on the up again, with the reliable market rumour of production cuts providing the foundation for both Brent and WTI to move back above $31 a barrel.
At this point, a decision between Opec and non-Opec members to cut production is not the important element; the key point is such talk allows the price to move upwards to a position where bears can hit the 'sell' button once again.
Rallies in oil in recent months have only lasted a few days, and once talk of a deal dries up, the way will be clear for the downtrend to resume.

 More protests in Greece. Helena Smith reports:
Unionists representing Greece's 35,000-strong nurses' federation have been protesting outside the finance ministry in the latest display of fury over the leftist-led government's draft proposals overhauling the pension system. Nurses, who have been hard hit by austerity, starting with relentless rounds of wage cuts, have become increasingly vociferous in recent months. Many turned up in surgery outfits. 
The country's union of civil servants (ADEDY) will stage a much bigger protest rally and march this evening to coincide with an extraordinary debate in parliament over the proposed measures. It will be the first time that prime minister Alexis Tsipras clashes in the 300-seat House with Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the newly-elected leader of New Democracy, the centre right main opposition party. The Harvard-educated erswhile banker, among the biggest champions of reform in Greece, has recently been leading polls.

Odysseus Trivalas, who heads ADEDY, told me: "Without any prospect of growth or reduction in unemployment the proposed pension reforms are unsustainable. The government keeps saying without these measures the system will collapse but we argue that with contributions so low and unemployment so high it will collapse anyway if the government does not provide extra funding through the budget." 
"The funds should have been strengthened with all that money that was initially earmarked for the recapitalisation of banks. They didn't listen to us and now they will pay the price because these protests are not going to end soon." 
Forecasts that Greek banks would need as much as (EURO)25bn to withstand possible shocks proved to be vastly over-inflated when it was estimated in November that recapitalisation needs would not exceed more than (EURO)5.7bn.
Farmers, who have also taken to the streets, are expected to expand tractor roadblocks nationwide during a rowdy meeting of union heads currently taking place in Thessaloniki. They have signalled they would be likely to vote to cut off road links and customs terminals with Bulgaria and Turkey to the north and east - causing yet more financial havoc for Greece.
"It is going to be very difficult for them to roll back without concrete promises by the government," Travalas added. "We are all one group now, determined to stop this legislation going through."

 More US data, and this time it is more positive for the Federal Reserve. 
January's consumer confidence index came in at 98.1, better than the 96.5 expected and the 96.3 level in December.
Dennis de Jong at UFX.com said:
Despite global economic volatility, that US consumer confidence levels are higher than expected will be music to the ears of Fed Chair Janet Yellen.
The US job market has surely contributed to the feel good vibe, with unemployment at a seven year low, in addition to sinking prices at the pumps providing consumer's wallets with a much needed fillip.
There are still dangers on the road ahead for Yellen and Co as global growth expectations have been downgraded and a strong dollar is starting to hurt US exports. However, considering the outlook for other major economies, Yellen has every right to be pleased with the start to the calendar year.

 World Bank slashes oil price forecast  
The World Bank has cut its forecast for crude oil prices for 2016 by $14 a barrel to $37, and also reduced its predictions for 37 out of 46 commodities. Phillip Inman reports:
The World Bank has slashed its forecast for oil prices this year, saying the cost of a barrel of crude will stay near its current lows for the rest of 2016.
The Washington-based institution said a glut of oil that sent prices crashing by almost half last year and another 27% this month will continue to dominate the market for the next year.
It added that warm winter weather in Europe and weaker than expected growth in China and other emerging economies will depress demand and keep the average price at $37 a barrel, down from a projection of $51 last October.
"Low prices for oil and commodities are likely to be with us for some time," said John Baffes, senior economist and lead author of the bank's commodities markets outlook. "While we see some prospect for commodity prices to rise slightly over the next two years, significant downside risks remain."
Brent crude is currently up 1.1% at $30.85 a barrel.

 US services sector slows  
More weak data for the US Federal Reserve to consider as it gathers for its first meeting since raising interest rates in December, a move many believe may have been a mistake.
The US services sector has seen its slowest growth since December 2014. The Markit initial reading for   the purchasing managers business activity index  came in at 53.7 in January. This is down from 54.3 the previous month and just below the expected 53.9. Markit said:
U.S. service providers started the year with another slowdown in business activity growth...Although still indicative of a solid increase in business activity, the headline index has now signalled weaker overall growth in four of the past five months. 
Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said a drop in business confidence suggested things could get worse:
The survey data paint an inauspicious start to the year for the US economy.
A struggling manufacturing economy is being accompanied by a services sector where growth showed further signs of losing momentum in January even before the bad weather hit.
The data are by no means disastrous, signalling a 1.5% annualised rate of economic growth at the start of the year, but the drop in business confidence to one of its lowest levels for over five years suggests that firms are bracing themselves for worse to come. Worries about financial market volatility, the impact of slower growth overseas, a downturn in the energy sector and uncertainty about higher interest rates all took their toll and set the scene for further weakness in coming months.

 Britain's economy continues to grow pretty steadily, according to the Bank of England's chief economist Andy Haldane, and a Chinese slowdown is unlikely to push the world economy into negative growth. 
Haldane said  in an interview   with Wolverhampton's Express and Star newspaper:
We would have to fall a long way, or something very untoward would have to happen for that to fall into negative territory,.
I think that is a reasonably unlikely event. Now are there things that could happen that could slow that rate of growth? Yes there are. It's true to say there are some concerns about how rapidly the Chinese economy is growing.
These days China is of such a size and it's sufficiently well integrated into the world economy that when it sneezes there is a sense at which the world economy is at risk of catching a cold.
Does that mean there is a chance that world growth could slow from current levels? Yes, there is a chance of that.
Do I think there is a big risk of us being tipped into negative growth in the world economy? That strikes me as quite unlikely as things sit today.

 Meanwhile, as Carney was speaking, the World Economic Forum has announced the Bank of England governor as one of eight "senior decision makers" joining a taskforce to discuss the future of the global financial system. 
The group was formed at the request of Carney and WEF founder professor Klaus Schwab and it will "work to identify, analyse and propose recommendations in response to major transformative forces influencing the future of global finance and economics."
A recent WEF document identified five areas which the taskforce could discuss in its first meeting: emerging markets, technologyi, regulatory and monetary policies, loss of trust in financial services and financial inclusion.
Apart from Carney the other members of the taskforce are Citgroup chief executive Michael Corbat; Blackrock chairman Laurence Fink; HSBC chairman Douglas Flint; Bank of America chairman Brian Moynihan; Raghuram Rajan, governor of the Reserve Bank of India; Min Zhu, deputy managing director of the IMF; and Liu Mingkang, economics and finance fellow at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

 Why is governor Mark Carney worrying about the current account deficit anyway? 
The current account is significant, as it shows the balance between the goods, services and financial transactions into, and out of, the UK. Britain has been running a persistent deficit for some time -- dubbed the 'invisible deficit', as the financial markets have been relaxed about it.
    UK current account deficit Photograph: ONS   
But historically, countries with large current account deficits have often been hit with currency crises, as investors eventually lose faith and stop buying your assets. That's what Mark Carney means when he mentions the "kindness of strangers".
A currency depreciation can actually help fix a current account deficit, as it makes imports unpleasantly expensive while helping exporters compete.
But as our economics editor Larry Elliot has argued, Britain doesn't have the manufacturing base to really profit from a Sterling crisis.

 Mark Carney on Brexit, oil, and his own future   
A quick recap of the main points from the Governor of the Bank of England's appearance at parliament: 
1) Mark Carney warned that Britain's current account deficit is still a risk to financial stability, due to the current market instability and the looming referendum on EU membership. 
He warned that:
First, the general global environment has been much more febrile, much more volatile.
Relying on the kindness of strangers is not optimal in that type of environment, and that's what is the case when you're running a 4%, 4.5% current account deficit.
And secondly, the possibility of a risk premium being attached to UK assets because of certain developments exists. And that plays into the riskiness of the situation.
Carney also agreed that "material decisions" can have an impact on financial stability, when questioned about Brexit. 
 2) Carney gave a clear hint that he might stay at the Bank of England for longer than planned. 
The governor's five-year term expires in July 2018, and he will decide this year whether to plump for a full eight-year term. 
I guess this is a new form of forward guidance....
 Related:  Mark Carney fails to rule out eight-year term at Bank of England
If he does, Carney would return to the jobs market just as the IMF's top job comes up. #MediaSpeculation
 3) Carney said the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike last month has added to the turbulence in the market. 
He said that domestic inflation pressure justified the hike, but cautioned that policymakers need to be aware that safe-haven currencies, and riskier ones, could both be buffeted as commodity prices tumble.
4)   Carney said there is "no concern" at present, about direct or indirect stresses on UK banks.  He argues that new capital rules, designed to bail in investors, should protect the system. 
 5) Carney also pointed out that OPEC's ability to influence the oil prices isn't what it was ( as the plunge in the Brent crude oil price shows us )
 6) Carney has also talked himself into a trip to the cinema.  Hopefully The Big Short won't give him any flashbacks

 Carney: 'Risk premium' could be added to UK assets  
 Rachel Reeves MP asks Carney about Britain's current account deficit, and the implications on UK trade if it leaves the EU.  
Q: Is the UK current account a growing risk, a declining risk, or a stable risk? And do you think Brexit would make it more or less of a risk?
Carney says the current account deficit has gone down somewhat, and the improvement in the European economy should mean our net foreign income improves (as Britain exports more across the Channel).
But he won't say that the riskiness has not gone down, for two reasons:
"First, the general global environment has been much more febrile, much more volatile. 
Relying on the kindness of strangers is not optimal in that type of environment, and that's what is the case when you're running a 4%, 4.5% current account deficit.
And secondly, the possibility of a risk premium being attached to UK assets because of certain developments exists. And that plays into the riskiness of the situation.
 Carney didn't define 'certain developments', but it's pretty clear what he meant.

Q: Can OPEC survive the slump in the oil price?
Mark Carney says that OPEC's ability to influence the global supply has been diminished, given technical developments and increased supply sources (eg US shale gas).
But the competitive position of the major opec suppliers, especially Saudi Arabia, is unrivalled as they can produce oil cheaper than many others. 
So one scenario is that OPEC has some influence, but at a lower price point.

If Mark Carney does change his mind and  serve a full eight years at the Bank of England, he would leave the BoE at the end of June 2021.
That's also the summer when the managing directorship of the International Monetary Fund becomes vacant. Christine Lagarde appears to be nailed-on to do a second five-year term, starting in July 2016.
When he arrived in London, the talk was that Carney fancied a move into Canadian politics.

 Now the Treasury Committee has moved onto the new rules to handle failed banks, which will see bond-holders 'bailed in' to cover the costs of a rescue.  
Q: When will the system be ready, and will it work? 
Carney says several things need to happen.
1) Banks need to refinance debt, so that their 'bail-in-able debt' is in the right place within the organisation, to cover the cost of failure.
2) The holders of the debt need to know that they can be bailed in - he doesn't want retail bond investors to be surprised that they are now shareholders.
3) That knowledge will creates an incentive on bond-holders to ensure that banks hold enough equity to handle problems.
The aim is to be ready by 2019, says Carney, so that the 'ring-fenced', systemically important banks are protected and can keep running after a collapse, if needed. 
This process will cost billions, and it will push up funding costs. But that's the price of avoiding another huge taxpayer-funded bailout.
Q: But could the markets freeze up, leaving banks unable to protect themselves?
Carney says he's met with many bank chiefs recently ( including, I suspect, at Davos ), and confirmed they are on track with building up the capital buffers they need.
He argues that there's very little chance of one bank failure causing a systemic failure. That's more likely to be triggered by a general shock to the economy.
Right now, he insists, there are no concerns about direct or indirect stresses on major banks.

Q: Carney is then asked who, if anyone, he consulted before giving a speech last week saying that it's not time to raise interest rates ?
I wouldn't clear a speech with anyone before giving my personal view, Carney replies.
Q: But did you discuss it with anyone on the MPC (monetary policy committee)?
All draft speeches by MPC members are circulated in advance, as a courtesy, says Carney. 
And he denies that he said rates would definitely stay on hold for some time (as some papers reported)
Q: So was the speech also shared with members of the FPC? (financial policy committee)?
It wasn't - MPC speeches aren't typically shared with the FPC beforehand.

Q: Was the Federal Reserve right to raise interest rates in December?
Carney gives a long answer, arguing there is solid growth at the core of advanced economies.
And domestic inflation pressures merited the change in monetary policy, he argues.
Q: But did the rate hike cause the turmoil in the financial markets in recent weeks?

We are making progress at the Bank of England, but there's more work to do, the governor says. And if I were to request a longer term, I'd probably have to do so by the end of this.

 Chinese market rout: What the experts say  
Analysts are divided over the severity of the Chinese slowdown.
 Yogi Dewan, founder of Hassium Asset Management (a wealth management firm) told Bloomberg TV that China is "slowing, not melting down".
He argues that Beijing are taking some "very positive" steps, including devaluing the yuan and building close financial links with Europe. 
But Joseph Oughourlian of Amber Capital Investment Management is less optimistic. He is steering clear of companies who benefitted from China's investment boom over the last 15 years. 
 FXTM  Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says investors are worried that capital will continue to ooze out of China, as people try to escape its slowing economy: 
A re-established wave of risk aversion gripped Asian equities sending most into red territory, while elevated fears that China capital outflows may accelerate as the economy decelerates has sent the Shanghai Composite Index diving -6.3% lower, to levels not seen in 13 months.
With days like today continuing to come back to haunt the Shanghai Composite Index, the Chinese New Year period and the trading break couldn't come soon enough.

 Shares in easyJet have dropped by 2%, after the company reported that recent terror attacks have weakened demand. 
The budget airline said revenue suffered after November's Paris terror attack, and the bombing of a plane flying form Egypt's Sharm el-Sheikh.
The recent market turmoil has also been a mixed blessing for the airline. The fall in the oil price will save it £180m on fuel costs, however currency moves will wipe out £50m.
In other words, easyJet needs fewer dollars to pay for fuel, but it needs to stump up more pounds to buy the dollars first....

Max Clifford claims Paul Burrell has lied in high court case; 
The former royal butler has launched a £50,000 claim that the PR guru passed private information about him to ex-News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks.

Staff and agencies.

PR guru Max Clifford has claimed in the high court that former royal butler Paul Burrell has "lied" in his evidence over a £50,000 privacy claim. 
On Monday, Clifford also denied himself telling a "pack of lies" and claimed he was innocent of the sex offences for which he is currently serving a prison sentence. 
He has previously branded Burrell's £50,000 claim for breach of confidence and misuse of private information as an "affront to common sense". 
Burrell says he hired Clifford in 2001 to limit bad press coverage about him but, rather than stopping stories, the publicist passed on material to the now-defunct News of the World. Clifford's case is that their agreement was for him to sell information to a newspaper.
Burrell told Deputy Judge Richard Spearman that the fax which Clifford sent to then NoW editor Rebekah Brooks in November 2002 was a "very personal, intimate and private documentation" of details about his life with the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and the late Princess Diana which was not in the public domain. 
"I worried about putting that down on paper and I worried if I was trusting the right person with that information," he said.
He rejected a claim by Steven Barrett, counsel for Clifford, that the information about the butler's fall downstairs, the help given him by the Queen and gifts she had given his family, was not "very exciting".
"At that time it would have been very interesting to any tabloid."
Barrett said: "Is it entirely possible that your anger and hurt feelings have arisen because this story just didn't sell?"
Burrell replied: "Absolutely not."
Clifford says that Burrell authorised him to send the fax as a "pitch" but the former butler says he hired the PR man to limit bad press coverage about him and any agreement was terminated before the fax was sent - the day after Burrell was acquitted at the Old Bailey of stealing items belonging to Princess Diana.
Referring to Clifford, Burrell said "This is a man who I trusted and was betrayed by."
 Burrell said that after the trial, he sold his story to the Daily Mirror for £300,000 as he had been "viciously" attacked by the media and wished to give his defence which was not heard in court. 
He was also offered £1m "to tell all" about his time in the royal household but decided not to. 
After he met Clifford in April 2002, he sent him a letter - which was later faxed to Brooks - in response to the PR man saying he needed to know more about him. 
"He said I had to trust him with my innermost secrets because all his clients did that and he locked their secrets up in his safe....he said that as my agent he would need to know my secrets so that he could defend me." 
He added: "The letter that I sent was a matter of trust. I thought to myself 'everyone trusts him', he had a reputation as the number one PR agent at that time, he was everyone's 'go to man'." 
He said that Clifford "went ballistic" when he terminated the relationship shortly afterwards because his counsel in the criminal trial said it could not continue. 
A year after the fax was sent, he published his book A Royal Duty but did not feel this gave Clifford some form of retrospective justification. 
"I am outraged and deeply upset by his actions. I trusted him. I find it difficult to explain just how low I was at that time. 
"It was the most challenging time of my life and I have never felt so vulnerable, so to know that someone I trusted breached my trust in that way, for commercial gain, is sickening. 
"At the time, I felt I had to trust someone, I obviously trusted the wrong person." 
 In his evidence, Clifford said that Burrell was never a PR client but came to him for one reason - to sell a "sensational" story about his time in royal service. 
The letter, which contained a "very very watered-down" version of what Burrell said he wanted to reveal, was sent him on the understanding that Clifford would use it to broker a deal for the sale. 
By sending the fax, he was following Burrell's instructions, said Clifford. 
After he sent it to Brooks, whose paper was the highest potential bidder, the money offered was a lot less than the £400,000 or £500,000 Burrell wanted. 
At that point, Clifford said he gave up as he did not have the time or inclination to waste on a story which was very weak and not worth much at all. 
"And it remained in confidence. Nothing he said to me appeared in the News of the World," Clifford said. 
Challenged by Burrell's counsel, William Bennett, that his evidence was "nothing more than a pack of lies", Clifford said: "It's 100% true and Paul Burrell knows it which is why he can't look me in the eyes now." 
Clifford, who maintains his innocence over the sex offences and says he is appealing against his conviction, denied that he was prepared to lie not only to Burrell but to the court. 
"No, it's Paul Burrell who has lied to this court, not me. Look at his face." 
At the close of his evidence, the judge qualified the normal courtesy granted to witnesses, saying: "For obvious reasons I am not going to say you are free to go." 
The hearing was adjourned until Tuesday.

MPs question appointment of former bankers' lobbyist in senior tax role; 
Treasury committee questions appointment of former British Bankers' Association chair Angela Knight as new head of Office of Tax Simplification.

Rajeev Syal.

George Osborne's decision to appoint a former bankers' lobbyist as an independent tax adviser has been questioned by an influential parliamentary committee.
The Treasury select committee expressed concerns on Tuesday over Angela Knight's previous role as chair of the British Bankers' Association (BBA) during the Libor scandal, her lack of tax knowledge and potential conflicts of interest with current directorships.
Knight, a former Tory MP, was appointed chair of the new Office of Tax Simplification (OTS) by the chancellor in December. The office's remit is to reduce complexities in the tax system, which have been blamed for allowing corporate tax avoidance. 
 Knight is also an independent director at the City firm Tullett Prebon, holds the same position at the financial management firm Brewin Dolphin, is a board member at Transport for London and is a member of the advisory board of the economic consultancy Oxera.
One member of the committee said that her appointment, which has been approved but with qualifications, looks suspiciously like another job for "the Tories' friends". 
Labour MP Wes Streeting said: "The qualified endorsement of her appointment does raise questions about the judgment of the chancellor and the seriousness with which he views his responsibilities to make appropriate appointments to important roles."
                     The report has been released as Osborne comes under increasing pressure over the government's attitude towards tax transparency and simplification. 
On Monday, the government denied that Google's deal to pay £130m in taxes owed over the last 10 years amounted to a "lower special rate" for the internet giant.
In the report, MPs questioned whether Knight's role could still be described as independent because it is outside proper parliamentary scrutiny. 
The committee said it had concerns about Knight's leadership, based on her role at the BBA, her previous engagements with the previous Treasury committee and her interactions with the parliamentary commission on banking standards. 
MPs also voiced fears over her independence from the Treasury and described her knowledge of tax issues as "limited". 
 They also questioned whether she was able to fulfil the role without personal conflict, given her other positions as a non-executive directors of several firms. 
Earlier this month, Knight repeatedly told MPs on the committee she was sorry that she ended up at the lobby group at the time of banking crisis and the Libor rigging scandal.
Knight, who ran the BBA between 2007 and 2012, said: "I am so sorry I ended up at the BBA during the banking crisis. I'm so sorry it chose me to be its target. I'm so sorry it took a trade association into a different era. I'm so sorry I never persuaded the authorities to take over [setting] Libor [rates] earlier and I'm so sorry the banks brought about [the] financial disaster they did."
The BBA was responsible for setting the Libor rate under Knight, but was stripped of its role in 2012 after the multi-billion rate-rigging scandal was uncovered.
Knight admitted that she wished she had been stronger in dealing with the problems that were uncovered with Libor, the regime for inter-bank interest rates, which the BBA administered at the time. Knight had wanted the Bank of England to have observer status to oversee Libor.
Andrew Tyrie MP, the Conservative chair of the committee, said: "The committee is content to approve Ms Knight's appointment and wishes her every success in her new role. But the committee had concerns about Angela Knight's suitability as chair of the OTS, stemming from her role at the BBA during the Libor-rigging scandal in 2008.
 "Ms Knight's experience at the BBA represented a small, but important, part of her career. The committee's concerns will be kept under review."
A Treasury spokesman said: "Angela Knight has a breadth of experience from a career spanning 43 years, including roles as an MP, businesswoman, Treasury minister and head of three industry bodies. This makes her a strong candidate for this part-time role providing recommendations on how we can make the tax system easier and simpler for taxpayers."

Tesco shareholders could sue for 'millions lost' after it overstated profits; 
Stewarts Law says it will write to supermarket before undertaking legal action to prove it misled shareholders.

Sarah Butler.

Findings by the grocery watchdog that Tesco deliberately delayed payments to boost profits may increase the likelihood of legal action by shareholders who say they lost tens of millions of pounds over the company's profits mis-statement in 2014. 
David Scott from Scott+Scott, the law firm representing Tesco Shareholder Claims, which is asking British shareholders to join a group seeking billions of pounds in compensation for losses, said: "Today's report confirms that pressure to meet financial targets drove the company's behaviour."
However, Scott said the group would wait to see the results of a separate investigation by the Serious Fraud Office before pressing ahead with its claim. 
Tesco is also facing potential legal action from a separate group of between 50 and 100 institutional British shareholders. 
Law firm Stewarts Law said it would be writing to Tesco shortly as a prelude to formal legal action that will seek to prove misleading statements were made to the market by the retailer, upon which shareholders relied when making investment decisions.
Stewarts Law made the announcement on Tuesday after the UK supermarket regulator, the groceries code adjudicator, ruled that the supermarket had deliberately delayed payments to suppliers to support its profits.
 Related:  Tesco delayed payments to suppliers to boost profits, watchdog finds
The GCA said the company had seriously breached its code and must make "significant changes" in the way it deals with suppliers. 
Tesco is also facing potential legal action in the US, where it has already agreed a $12m (£7.94m) deal to settle one of two shareholder class action suits over its accounting scandal.
                     Stewarts Law began soliciting angry shareholders to support joint action against Tesco in September 2014, backed by Bentham Europe, an offshoot of Australian group IMF Bentham, which specialises in funding litigation.
It said it was moving forward with legal action in the light of what it claimed was "mounting evidence that Tesco's management were aware that the financial statements were untrue or misleading", including recent press reports that  the Serious Fraud Office has interviewed former senior executives and is considering agreeing a deal with Tesco.
Jeremy Marshall, chief investment officer of Bentham Europe, said: "The prospect of litigation is a necessary consequence of the apparent failure of Tesco's former management to protect their shareholders from avoidable losses. We hope the company will face up to the seeming failings of previous management and move swiftly to resolve this dispute." 
Tesco's chief executive, Dave Lewis, who joined the business in September 2014, just a few days before the accounting scandal emerged, said the company had not received any formal contact from shareholders with regard to legal action in the UK and had not made any financial provision for it.
He added that it was misleading to link the findings of a grocery watchdog inquiry, the results of which were published on Tuesday when Stewarts Law issued its press release, to the Serious Fraud Office inquiry.
"What either investigator is investigating is different and the onus of proof is completely different," he said.
There have been suggestions that the SFO could release the findings of its inquiry as early as this week. City analysts have warned that Tesco could face a £500m fine for its multimillion pound accounting scandal.

Democracy falters in south-east Asia as Malaysia's PM cleared of corruption; 
End of investigation into $681m payment to Najib Razak adds to fears for freedoms across the region, but international condemnation remains muted.

Simon Tisdall.

                     The extraordinary decision to drop corruption investigations into Najib Razak, Malaysia's prime minister, highlights growing concern about lack of democratic accountability in Malaysia and across south-east Asia as a whole.
Mohamed Apandi Ali, a former judge with ruling party links, who was appointed attorney general by Najib last year, said on Tuesday that $681m (£475m) secretly deposited in Najib's personal bank accounts was a private gift from the Saudi royal family. 
 Related:  Malaysian prime minister cleared of corruption over $681m Saudi 'gift' 
Apandi refused to address the central question of why the gift was made and for what purpose. The deposit came to light last July after foreign media investigations [paywall] into a debt-ridden state fund run by Najib known as 1MDB. 
"I am satisfied with the findings that the funds were not a form of graft or bribery. There was no reason given as to why the donation was made to PM Najib, that is between him and the Saudi family," Apandi said.
Apandi offered no explanation as to why $620m was apparently later returned to the Saudis, and what happened to the remaining $61m. The Saudi regime has declined to discuss the matter.
Najib has always denied any wrongdoing. His unmatched influence as prime minister since 2009 in the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition, and his leadership of its main political component, the United Malays National Organisation, in power continuously since 1957, makes him a difficult man to challenge.
                     Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's best-known, much-persecuted opposition leader, nearly defeated Najib in the 2013 elections. He has has since been jailed again, on what are widely viewed as trumped-up charges. In November a UN human rights group said Anwar's detention was illegal and his treatment in prison cruel and degrading.
Mass street protests last August failed to dislodge Najib. An ongoing currency and foreign investment slump, related to the scandal, and a demand from Malaysia's unofficial founding father, Mahathir Mohamad, that he resign have also left him unmoved.
Instead, Najib has silenced critics, sacking ministers, appointing loyalists, and dismissing the previous attorney general, Abdul Gani Patail, who was leading corruption inquiries. Under the guise of fighting terrorism, Najib has also taken additional powers to control media and opposition, notably last month's draconian new national security council law. Human rights groups described the law as a step towards dictatorship.
In a statement on Tuesday Najib called the scandal an "unnecessary distraction" and claimed the matter had been "comprehensively put to rest". However, the 1MDB affair reportedly remains under legal investigation in Switzerland, Hong Kong and the US. 
The absence of an international outcry about this failure of democratic accountability in Malaysia is troubling. Visiting Kuala Lumpur last July, David Cameron went through the motions, urging Najib to clean up his act. Likewise, at a November meeting, Barack Obama said he had impressed [paywall] upon Najib the importance of accountability and transparency.
In the case of the US and Britain, the former colonial power, the reluctance to make waves may be explained by the high priority they attach to keeping Malaysia, a moderate, pro-western, mostly Sunni Muslim ally, onside in the age of Islamic State and global jihad. The Obama administration also views Malaysia as part of its informal regional bulwark against China's rise, and as an important Asia-Pacific trading partner. 
Similar considerations appear to influence western attitudes towards the repressive behaviour of the junta in neighbouring Thailand. Despite earlier promises, Gen Prayuth Chan-ocha, the junta's leader, has still not set a date for free elections.

In Vietnam, meanwhile, where George W Bush's administration began a process of rapprochement in the early 2000s, the US continues to turn a blind eye to one-party rule, partly in return for Vietnamese support over Chinese maritime expansionism. 
Even this modest aim is at risk as this week's Communist party congress prepares to dump Nguyen Tan Dung, the country's moderately reformist prime minister, in favour of the authoritarian old guard. 
Amid the gloom, Myanmar may offer a glimmer of regional light after last November's landslide election victory of the opposition National League for Democracy (NLD), led by Aung San Suu Kyi. The NLD is due to take its seats in the new parliament on Monday.
But despite assurances about a proper democratic transition, Myanmar's military seems reluctant to hand over real control. It retains sweeping constitutional powers over security, budgets, borders and external relations, and will have a veto over who becomes the next president. 
Aung San Suu Kyi met the army chief, Min Aung Hlaing, this week for only a second time since November, and it was all smiles for the cameras. But this attempt to establish a credible, functioning democracy in Myanmar could yet end in tears.

 The slump in the oil price should theoretically be good for the global economy but stock markets at least do not seem to be taking that on board. Julian Jessop at Capital Economics says:
In principle, a lower oil price should be positive for the world economy. The transfer of income from producers to consumers, who are more likely to spend on other goods and services, should boost global demand. At worst, the impact might be expected to be neutral, with the winners offsetting the losers. In practice, though, the net impact of the recent slump in oil prices appears to have been negative, or at least perceived as such in financial markets.
There are a number of factors at play here. First, the speed and extent of the slump has itself added to the uncertainty about the global economy. Rightly or (more probably) wrongly, the fall has been interpreted as evidence of a collapse in demand and fuelled fears about a hard landing in China in particular.
Second, the costs to producers have been proportionately much larger (relative to their incomes) than the benefits to consumers. This concentration of losses relative to the more diffuse benefits is one reason why producers appear to have cut their spending more quickly and by a larger amount than consumers have increased theirs.

This asymmetry has compounded the negative impacts on financial markets. Energy companies may now only account, for example, for a small share of the US junk bond market, but the fear is that there will be widespread defaults throughout this sector, rippling through the financial system as a whole. Similarly, the impact on the 20% or so of the UK FTSE 100 accounted for by commodity producers is far more visible than the potential benefits to the remaining 80% who are not.
Pressure on oil producers to sell assets accumulated in Sovereign Wealth Funds has also soured the mood, even though this selling might actually boost the global economy if the proceeds are used to support local spending.
The additional downward pressure on headline inflation from lower energy costs has revived fears that vulnerable economies may slip into a more damaging period of deflation.
However, this analysis does also allow us to draw some more positive conclusions. Stabilisation in oil prices - even at a low level - should at least ease some of the associated uncertainty about the health of the global economy. The downward pressure on headline inflation should unwind too. Many of the negatives are also about timing. Producers have generally been quicker to adjust their spending, but eventually this should be outweighed by increases in spending by consumers on other goods and services.
On balance, then we continue to expect an extended period of lower oil prices to boost global growth over the next few years, even if this process may take longer than we had anticipated.

 The recovery in the oil price has given a boost to stock markets and follows hopes that Opec would be willing to cut production if non-member countries - notably Russia - also agree to reduce supply. 
Iraqui oil minister Adel Abdel Mahdi said he saw some flexibility for a deal with rival producers, and as a consequence, Brent crude is now up 2.9% at $31.38. But given the recent volatility, the gains may not last long. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at online trading group IG, said:
As oil goes, so goes the rest of the market. Yesterday a rapid decline in crude paved the way for stock markets to give up their gains, but today the price of black gold is on the up again, with the reliable market rumour of production cuts providing the foundation for both Brent and WTI to move back above $31 a barrel.
At this point, a decision between Opec and non-Opec members to cut production is not the important element; the key point is such talk allows the price to move upwards to a position where bears can hit the 'sell' button once again.
Rallies in oil in recent months have only lasted a few days, and once talk of a deal dries up, the way will be clear for the downtrend to resume.

 More protests in Greece. Helena Smith reports:
Unionists representing Greece's 35,000-strong nurses' federation have been protesting outside the finance ministry in the latest display of fury over the leftist-led government's draft proposals overhauling the pension system. Nurses, who have been hard hit by austerity, starting with relentless rounds of wage cuts, have become increasingly vociferous in recent months. Many turned up in surgery outfits. 
The country's union of civil servants (ADEDY) will stage a much bigger protest rally and march this evening to coincide with an extraordinary debate in parliament over the proposed measures. It will be the first time that prime minister Alexis Tsipras clashes in the 300-seat House with Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the newly-elected leader of New Democracy, the centre right main opposition party. The Harvard-educated erswhile banker, among the biggest champions of reform in Greece, has recently been leading polls.

Odysseus Trivalas, who heads ADEDY, told me: "Without any prospect of growth or reduction in unemployment the proposed pension reforms are unsustainable. The government keeps saying without these measures the system will collapse but we argue that with contributions so low and unemployment so high it will collapse anyway if the government does not provide extra funding through the budget." 
"The funds should have been strengthened with all that money that was initially earmarked for the recapitalisation of banks. They didn't listen to us and now they will pay the price because these protests are not going to end soon." 
Forecasts that Greek banks would need as much as (EURO)25bn to withstand possible shocks proved to be vastly over-inflated when it was estimated in November that recapitalisation needs would not exceed more than (EURO)5.7bn.
Farmers, who have also taken to the streets, are expected to expand tractor roadblocks nationwide during a rowdy meeting of union heads currently taking place in Thessaloniki. They have signalled they would be likely to vote to cut off road links and customs terminals with Bulgaria and Turkey to the north and east - causing yet more financial havoc for Greece.
"It is going to be very difficult for them to roll back without concrete promises by the government," Travalas added. "We are all one group now, determined to stop this legislation going through."

 More US data, and this time it is more positive for the Federal Reserve. 
January's consumer confidence index came in at 98.1, better than the 96.5 expected and the 96.3 level in December.
Dennis de Jong at UFX.com said:
Despite global economic volatility, that US consumer confidence levels are higher than expected will be music to the ears of Fed Chair Janet Yellen.
The US job market has surely contributed to the feel good vibe, with unemployment at a seven year low, in addition to sinking prices at the pumps providing consumer's wallets with a much needed fillip.
There are still dangers on the road ahead for Yellen and Co as global growth expectations have been downgraded and a strong dollar is starting to hurt US exports. However, considering the outlook for other major economies, Yellen has every right to be pleased with the start to the calendar year.

 World Bank slashes oil price forecast  
The World Bank has cut its forecast for crude oil prices for 2016 by $14 a barrel to $37, and also reduced its predictions for 37 out of 46 commodities. Phillip Inman reports:
The World Bank has slashed its forecast for oil prices this year, saying the cost of a barrel of crude will stay near its current lows for the rest of 2016.
The Washington-based institution said a glut of oil that sent prices crashing by almost half last year and another 27% this month will continue to dominate the market for the next year.
It added that warm winter weather in Europe and weaker than expected growth in China and other emerging economies will depress demand and keep the average price at $37 a barrel, down from a projection of $51 last October.
"Low prices for oil and commodities are likely to be with us for some time," said John Baffes, senior economist and lead author of the bank's commodities markets outlook. "While we see some prospect for commodity prices to rise slightly over the next two years, significant downside risks remain."
Brent crude is currently up 1.1% at $30.85 a barrel.

 US services sector slows  
More weak data for the US Federal Reserve to consider as it gathers for its first meeting since raising interest rates in December, a move many believe may have been a mistake.
The US services sector has seen its slowest growth since December 2014. The Markit initial reading for   the purchasing managers business activity index  came in at 53.7 in January. This is down from 54.3 the previous month and just below the expected 53.9. Markit said:
U.S. service providers started the year with another slowdown in business activity growth...Although still indicative of a solid increase in business activity, the headline index has now signalled weaker overall growth in four of the past five months. 
Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said a drop in business confidence suggested things could get worse:
The survey data paint an inauspicious start to the year for the US economy.
A struggling manufacturing economy is being accompanied by a services sector where growth showed further signs of losing momentum in January even before the bad weather hit.
The data are by no means disastrous, signalling a 1.5% annualised rate of economic growth at the start of the year, but the drop in business confidence to one of its lowest levels for over five years suggests that firms are bracing themselves for worse to come. Worries about financial market volatility, the impact of slower growth overseas, a downturn in the energy sector and uncertainty about higher interest rates all took their toll and set the scene for further weakness in coming months.

 Britain's economy continues to grow pretty steadily, according to the Bank of England's chief economist Andy Haldane, and a Chinese slowdown is unlikely to push the world economy into negative growth. 
Haldane said  in an interview   with Wolverhampton's Express and Star newspaper:
We would have to fall a long way, or something very untoward would have to happen for that to fall into negative territory,.
I think that is a reasonably unlikely event. Now are there things that could happen that could slow that rate of growth? Yes there are. It's true to say there are some concerns about how rapidly the Chinese economy is growing.
These days China is of such a size and it's sufficiently well integrated into the world economy that when it sneezes there is a sense at which the world economy is at risk of catching a cold.
Does that mean there is a chance that world growth could slow from current levels? Yes, there is a chance of that.
Do I think there is a big risk of us being tipped into negative growth in the world economy? That strikes me as quite unlikely as things sit today.

 Meanwhile, as Carney was speaking, the World Economic Forum has announced the Bank of England governor as one of eight "senior decision makers" joining a taskforce to discuss the future of the global financial system. 
The group was formed at the request of Carney and WEF founder professor Klaus Schwab and it will "work to identify, analyse and propose recommendations in response to major transformative forces influencing the future of global finance and economics."
A recent WEF document identified five areas which the taskforce could discuss in its first meeting: emerging markets, technologyi, regulatory and monetary policies, loss of trust in financial services and financial inclusion.
Apart from Carney the other members of the taskforce are Citgroup chief executive Michael Corbat; Blackrock chairman Laurence Fink; HSBC chairman Douglas Flint; Bank of America chairman Brian Moynihan; Raghuram Rajan, governor of the Reserve Bank of India; Min Zhu, deputy managing director of the IMF; and Liu Mingkang, economics and finance fellow at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

 Why is governor Mark Carney worrying about the current account deficit anyway? 
The current account is significant, as it shows the balance between the goods, services and financial transactions into, and out of, the UK. Britain has been running a persistent deficit for some time -- dubbed the 'invisible deficit', as the financial markets have been relaxed about it.
    UK current account deficit Photograph: ONS   
But historically, countries with large current account deficits have often been hit with currency crises, as investors eventually lose faith and stop buying your assets. That's what Mark Carney means when he mentions the "kindness of strangers".
A currency depreciation can actually help fix a current account deficit, as it makes imports unpleasantly expensive while helping exporters compete.
But as our economics editor Larry Elliot has argued, Britain doesn't have the manufacturing base to really profit from a Sterling crisis.

 Mark Carney on Brexit, oil, and his own future   
A quick recap of the main points from the Governor of the Bank of England's appearance at parliament: 
1) Mark Carney warned that Britain's current account deficit is still a risk to financial stability, due to the current market instability and the looming referendum on EU membership. 
He warned that:
First, the general global environment has been much volatile.
Relying on the kindness of strangers is not optimal in that type of environment, and that's what is the case when you're running a 4%, 4.5% current account deficit.
And secondly, the possibility of a risk premium being attached to UK assets because of certain developments exists. And that plays into the riskiness of the situation.
Carney also agreed that "material decisions" can have an impact on financial stability, when questioned about Brexit. 
 2) Carney gave a clear hint that he might stay at the Bank of England for longer than planned. 
The governor's five-year term expires in July 2018, and he will decide this year whether to plump for a full eight-year term. 
I guess this is a new form of forward guidance....

If he does, Carney would return to the jobs market just as the IMF's top job comes up. #MediaSpeculation
 3) Carney said the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike last month has added to the turbulence in the market. 
He said that domestic inflation pressure justified the hike, but cautioned that policymakers need to be aware that safe-haven currencies, and riskier ones, could both be buffeted as commodity prices tumble.
4)   Carney said there is "no concern" at present, about direct or indirect stresses on UK banks.  He argues that new capital rules, designed to bail in investors, should protect the system. 
 5) Carney also pointed out that OPEC's ability to influence the oil prices isn't what it was ( as the plunge in the Brent crude oil price shows us )
 6) Carney has also talked himself into a trip to the cinema.  Hopefully The Big Short won't give him any flashbacks

Q: Has the MPC or FPC gathered any information on how negative interest rates might affect the UK economy?
We have thought more carefully about where the zero lower bound is, Carney replies. [ie, could they cut rates below the current record low of 0.5%?]
But the actual question of negative interest rates, and the impact on the financial system, has not arisen, as we don't think that is the prospect.

No, and it wouldn't make a difference if it tried, Carney replies.

Carney says the latest financial stability report concluded that the biggest risk had moved from advanced economies to emerging economies. He still thinks that is still the case.

 Carney: 'Risk premium' could be added to UK assets  
 Rachel Reeves MP asks Carney about Britain's current account deficit, and the implications on UK trade if it leaves the EU.  
Q: Is the UK current account a growing risk, a declining risk, or a stable risk? And do you think Brexit would make it more or less of a risk?
Carney says the current account deficit has gone down somewhat, and the improvement in the European economy should mean our net foreign income improves (as Britain exports more across the Channel).
But he won't say that the riskiness has not gone down, for two reasons:
"First, the general global environment has been much volatile. 
Relying on the kindness of strangers is not optimal in that type of environment, and that's what is the case when you're running a 4%, 4.5% current account deficit.
And secondly, the possibility of a risk premium being attached to UK assets because of certain developments exists. And that plays into the riskiness of the situation.
 Carney didn't define 'certain developments', but it's pretty clear what he meant.

Mark Carney says that OPEC's ability to influence the global supply has been diminished, given technical developments and increased supply sources (eg US shale gas).
But the competitive position of the major opec suppliers, especially Saudi Arabia, is unrivalled as they can produce oil cheaper than many others. 
So one scenario is that OPEC has some influence, but at a lower price point.

When he arrived in London, the talk was that Carney fancied a move into Canadian politics.

 Now the Treasury Committee has moved onto the new rules to handle failed banks, which will see bond-holders 'bailed in' to cover the costs of a rescue.  
Q: When will the system be ready, and will it work? 
Carney says several things need to happen.
1) Banks need to refinance debt, so that their 'bail-in-able debt' is in the right place within the organisation, to cover the cost of failure.
2) The holders of the debt need to know that they can be bailed in - he doesn't want retail bond investors to be surprised that they are now shareholders.
3) That knowledge will creates an incentive on bond-holders to ensure that banks hold enough equity to handle problems.
The aim is to be ready by 2019, says Carney, so that the 'ring-fenced', systemically important banks are protected and can keep running after a collapse, if needed. 
This process will cost billions, and it will push up funding costs. But that's the price of avoiding another huge taxpayer-funded bailout.
Q: But could the markets freeze up, leaving banks unable to protect themselves?
Carney says he's met with many bank chiefs recently ( including, I suspect, at Davos ), and confirmed they are on track with building up the capital buffers they need.
He argues that there's very little chance of one bank failure causing a systemic failure. That's more likely to be triggered by a general shock to the economy.
Right now, he insists, there are no concerns about direct or indirect stresses on major banks.

Bailey has been in charge of prudential regulation at the Bank of England - trying to sure that banks stick to the rules, and avoid the damaging risks that caused the 2008 financial crisis.

 Chinese market rout: What the experts say  
Analysts are divided over the severity of the Chinese slowdown.
 Yogi Dewan, founder of Hassium Asset Management (a wealth management firm) told Bloomberg TV that China is "slowing, not melting down".
He argues that Beijing are taking some "very positive" steps, including devaluing the yuan and building close financial links with Europe. 
But Joseph Oughourlian of Amber Capital Investment Management is less optimistic. He is steering clear of companies who benefitted from China's investment boom over the last 15 years. 
 FXTM  Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says investors are worried that capital will continue to ooze out of China, as people try to escape its slowing economy: 
A re-established wave of risk aversion gripped Asian equities sending most into red territory, while elevated fears that China capital outflows may accelerate as the economy decelerates has sent the Shanghai Composite Index diving -6.3% lower, to levels not seen in 13 months.
With days like today continuing to come back to haunt the Shanghai Composite Index, the Chinese New Year period and the trading break couldn't come soon enough.

 Shares in easyJet have dropped by 2%, after the company reported that recent terror attacks have weakened demand. 
The budget airline said revenue suffered after November's Paris terror attack, and the bombing of a plane flying form Egypt's Sharm el-Sheikh.
The recent market turmoil has also been a mixed blessing for the airline. The fall in the oil price will save it £180m on fuel costs, however currency moves will wipe out £50m.
In other words, easyJet needs fewer dollars to pay for fuel, but it needs to stump up more pounds to buy the dollars first....

The fall in oil prices will make most of the headlines and drive most of the movement in markets today, unless it is reversed for no particularly good reason. The latest driver is the news that Iraqi oil output is strong. US production remains the key swing on supply and is what will eventually trigger a turn. But it will take hard news about declining US output to shift the market mood.

 The recovery in the oil price has given a boost to stock markets and follows hopes that Opec would be willing to cut production if non-member countries - notably Russia - also agree to reduce supply. 
Iraqui oil minister Adel Abdel Mahdi said he saw some flexibility for a deal with rival producers, and as a consequence, Brent crude is now up 2.9% at $31.38. But given the recent volatility, the gains may not last long. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at online trading group IG, said:
As oil goes, so goes the rest of the market. Yesterday a rapid decline in crude paved the way for stock markets to give up their gains, but today the price of black gold is on the up again, with the reliable market rumour of production cuts providing the foundation for both Brent and WTI to move back above $31 a barrel.
At this point, a decision between Opec and non-Opec members to cut production is not the important element; the key point is such talk allows the price to move upwards to a position where bears can hit the 'sell' button once again. 
Rallies in oil in recent months have only lasted a few days, and once talk of a deal dries up, the way will be clear for the downtrend to resume.

 More protests in Greece. Helena Smith reports:
Unionists representing Greece's 35,000-strong nurses' federation have been protesting outside the finance ministry in the latest display of fury over the leftist-led government's draft proposals overhauling the pension system. Nurses, who have been hard hit by austerity, starting with relentless rounds of wage cuts, have become increasingly vociferous in recent months. Many turned up in surgery outfits. 
The country's union of civil servants (ADEDY) will stage a much bigger protest rally and march this evening to coincide with an extraordinary debate in parliament over the proposed measures. It will be the first time that prime minister Alexis Tsipras clashes in the 300-seat House with Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the newly-elected leader of New Democracy, the centre right main opposition party. The Harvard-educated erswhile banker, among the biggest champions of reform in Greece, has recently been leading polls.

Odysseus Trivalas, who heads ADEDY, told me: "Without any prospect of growth or reduction in unemployment the proposed pension reforms are unsustainable. The government keeps saying without these measures the system will collapse but we argue that with contributions so low and unemployment so high it will collapse anyway if the government does not provide extra funding through the budget." 
"The funds should have been strengthened with all that money that was initially earmarked for the recapitalisation of banks. They didn't listen to us and now they will pay the price because these protests are not going to end soon." 
Forecasts that Greek banks would need as much as (EURO)25bn to withstand possible shocks proved to be vastly over-inflated when it was estimated in November that recapitalisation needs would not exceed more than (EURO)5.7bn.
Farmers, who have also taken to the streets, are expected to expand tractor roadblocks nationwide during a rowdy meeting of union heads currently taking place in Thessaloniki. They have signalled they would be likely to vote to cut off road links and customs terminals with Bulgaria and Turkey to the north and east - causing yet more financial havoc for Greece.
"It is going to be very difficult for them to roll back without concrete promises by the government," Travalas added. "We are all one group now, determined to stop this legislation going through."

 More US data, and this time it is more positive for the Federal Reserve. 
January's consumer confidence index came in at 98.1, better than the 96.5 expected and the 96.3 level in December.
Dennis de Jong at UFX.com said:
Despite global economic volatility, that US consumer confidence levels are higher than expected will be music to the ears of Fed Chair Janet Yellen.
The US job market has surely contributed to the feel good vibe, with unemployment at a seven year low, in addition to sinking prices at the pumps providing consumer's wallets with a much needed fillip.
There are still dangers on the road ahead for Yellen and Co as global growth expectations have been downgraded and a strong dollar is starting to hurt US exports. However, considering the outlook for other major economies, Yellen has every right to be pleased with the start to the calendar year.

 World Bank slashes oil price forecast  
The World Bank has cut its forecast for crude oil prices for 2016 by $14 a barrel to $37, and also reduced its predictions for 37 out of 46 commodities. Phillip Inman reports:
The World Bank has slashed its forecast for oil prices this year, saying the cost of a barrel of crude will stay near its current lows for the rest of 2016.
The Washington-based institution said a glut of oil that sent prices crashing by almost half last year and another 27% this month will continue to dominate the market for the next year.
It added that warm winter weather in Europe and weaker than expected growth in China and other emerging economies will depress demand and keep the average price at $37 a barrel, down from a projection of $51 last October.
"Low prices for oil and commodities are likely to be with us for some time," said John Baffes, senior economist and lead author of the bank's commodities markets outlook. "While we see some prospect for commodity prices to rise slightly over the next two years, significant downside risks remain."
Brent crude is currently up 1.1% at $30.85 a barrel.

 US services sector slows  
More weak data for the US Federal Reserve to consider as it gathers for its first meeting since raising interest rates in December, a move many believe may have been a mistake.
The US services sector has seen its slowest growth since December 2014. The Markit initial reading for   the purchasing managers business activity index  came in at 53.7 in January. This is down from 54.3 the previous month and just below the expected 53.9. Markit said:
U.S. service providers started the year with another slowdown in business activity growth...Although still indicative of a solid increase in business activity, the headline index has now signalled weaker overall growth in four of the past five months. 
Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said a drop in business confidence suggested things could get worse:
The survey data paint an inauspicious start to the year for the US economy.
A struggling manufacturing economy is being accompanied by a services sector where growth showed further signs of losing momentum in January even before the bad weather hit.
The data are by no means disastrous, signalling a 1.5% annualised rate of economic growth at the start of the year, but the drop in business confidence to one of its lowest levels for over five years suggests that firms are bracing themselves for worse to come. Worries about financial market volatility, the impact of slower growth overseas, a downturn in the energy sector and uncertainty about higher interest rates all took their toll and set the scene for further weakness in coming months.

 Britain's economy continues to grow pretty steadily, according to the Bank of England's chief economist Andy Haldane, and a Chinese slowdown is unlikely to push the world economy into negative growth. 
Haldane said  in an interview   with Wolverhampton's Express and Star newspaper:
We would have to fall a long way, or something very untoward would have to happen for that to fall into negative territory,.
I think that is a reasonably unlikely event. Now are there things that could happen that could slow that rate of growth? Yes there are. It's true to say there are some concerns about how rapidly the Chinese economy is growing.
These days China is of such a size and it's sufficiently well integrated into the world economy that when it sneezes there is a sense at which the world economy is at risk of catching a cold.
Does that mean there is a chance that world growth could slow from current levels? Yes, there is a chance of that.
Do I think there is a big risk of us being tipped into negative growth in the world economy? That strikes me as quite unlikely as things sit today.

The group was formed at the request of Carney and WEF founder professor Klaus Schwab and it will "work to identify, analyse and propose recommendations in response to major transformative forces influencing the future of global finance and economics."

Apart from Carney the other members of the taskforce are Citgroup chief executive Michael Corbat; Blackrock chairman Laurence Fink; HSBC chairman Douglas Flint; Bank of America chairman Brian Moynihan; Raghuram Rajan, governor of the Reserve Bank of India; Min Zhu, deputy managing director of the IMF; and Liu Mingkang, economics and finance fellow at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

 Why is governor Mark Carney worrying about the current account deficit anyway? 
The current account is significant, as it shows the balance between the goods, services and financial transactions into, and out of, the UK. Britain has been running a persistent deficit for some time -- dubbed the 'invisible deficit', as the financial markets have been relaxed about it.
    UK current account deficit Photograph: ONS   
But historically, countries with large current account deficits have often been hit with currency crises, as investors eventually lose faith and stop buying your assets. That's what Mark Carney means when he mentions the "kindness of strangers".
A currency depreciation can actually help fix a current account deficit, as it makes imports unpleasantly expensive while helping exporters compete.
But as our economics editor Larry Elliot has argued, Britain doesn't have the manufacturing base to really profit from a Sterling crisis.

 Mark Carney on Brexit, oil, and his own future   
A quick recap of the main points from the Governor of the Bank of England's appearance at parliament: 
1) Mark Carney warned that Britain's current account deficit is still a risk to financial stability, due to the current market instability and the looming referendum on EU membership. 
He warned that:
First, the general global environment has been much volatile.
Relying on the kindness of strangers is not optimal in that type of environment, and that's what is the case when you're running a 4%, 4.5% current account deficit.
And secondly, the possibility of a risk premium being attached to UK assets because of certain developments exists. And that plays into the riskiness of the situation.
Carney also agreed that "material decisions" can have an impact on financial stability, when questioned about Brexit. 
 2) Carney gave a clear hint that he might stay at the Bank of England for longer than planned. 
The governor's five-year term expires in July 2018, and he will decide this year whether to plump for a full eight-year term. 
I guess this is a new form of forward guidance....
 Related:  Mark Carney fails to rule out eight-year term at Bank of England
If he does, Carney would return to the jobs market just as the IMF's top job comes up. #MediaSpeculation
 3) Carney said the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike last month has added to the turbulence in the market. 
He said that domestic inflation pressure justified the hike, but cautioned that policymakers need to be aware that safe-haven currencies, and riskier ones, could both be buffeted as commodity prices tumble.
4)   Carney said there is "no concern" at present, about direct or indirect stresses on UK banks.  He argues that new capital rules, designed to bail in investors, should protect the system. 
 5) Carney also pointed out that OPEC's ability to influence the oil prices isn't what it was ( as the plunge in the Brent crude oil price shows us )
 6) Carney has also talked himself into a trip to the cinema.  Hopefully The Big Short won't give him any flashbacks

 Carney: 'Risk premium' could be added to UK assets  
 Rachel Reeves MP asks Carney about Britain's current account deficit, and the implications on UK trade if it leaves the EU.  
Q: Is the UK current account a growing risk, a declining risk, or a stable risk? And do you think Brexit would make it more or less of a risk?
Carney says the current account deficit has gone down somewhat, and the improvement in the European economy should mean our net foreign income improves (as Britain exports more across the Channel).
But he won't say that the riskiness has not gone down, for two reasons:
"First, the general global environment has been much volatile. 
Relying on the kindness of strangers is not optimal in that type of environment, and that's what is the case when you're running a 4%, 4.5% current account deficit.
And secondly, the possibility of a risk premium being attached to UK assets because of certain developments exists. And that plays into the riskiness of the situation.
 Carney didn't define 'certain developments', but it's pretty clear what he meant.

Q: Can OPEC survive the slump in the oil price?
Mark Carney says that OPEC's ability to influence the global supply has been diminished, given technical developments and increased supply sources (eg US shale gas).
But the competitive position of the major opec suppliers, especially Saudi Arabia, is unrivalled as they can produce oil cheaper than many others. 
So one scenario is that OPEC has some influence, but at a lower price point.

If Mark Carney does change his mind and  serve a full eight years at the Bank of England, he would leave the BoE at the end of June 2021.
That's also the summer when the managing directorship of the International Monetary Fund becomes vacant. Christine Lagarde appears to be nailed-on to do a second five-year term, starting in July 2016.
When he arrived in London, the talk was that Carney fancied a move into Canadian politics. 
The prime minister-ship is now in Justin Trudeau's youthful hands, and could stay there for some time.

enltrMark Carney: "What is not happening right now is any concern about distress at any of the major systemic financial institutions"

block-time published-time 10.45am GMT 
 Now the Treasury Committee has moved onto the new rules to handle failed banks, which will see bond-holders 'bailed in' to cover the costs of a rescue.  
Q: When will the system be ready, and will it work? 
Carney says several things need to happen.
1) Banks need to refinance debt, so that their 'bail-in-able debt' is in the right place within the organisation, to cover the cost of failure.
2) The holders of the debt need to know that they can be bailed in - he doesn't want retail bond investors to be surprised that they are now shareholders.
3) That knowledge will creates an incentive on bond-holders to ensure that banks hold enough equity to handle problems.
The aim is to be ready by 2019, says Carney, so that the 'ring-fenced', systemically important banks are protected and can keep running after a collapse, if needed. 
This process will cost billions, and it will push up funding costs. But that's the price of avoiding another huge taxpayer-funded bailout.
Q: But could the markets freeze up, leaving banks unable to protect themselves?
Carney says he's met with many bank chiefs recently ( including, I suspect, at Davos ), and confirmed they are on track with building up the capital buffers they need.
He argues that there's very little chance of one bank failure causing a systemic failure. That's more likely to be triggered by a general shock to the economy.
Right now, he insists, there are no concerns about direct or indirect stresses on major banks.

Q: Carney is then asked who, if anyone, he consulted before giving a speech last week saying that it's not time to raise interest rates ?
I wouldn't clear a speech with anyone before giving my personal view, Carney replies.
Q: But did you discuss it with anyone on the MPC (monetary policy committee)?
All draft speeches by MPC members are circulated in advance, as a courtesy, says Carney. 
And he denies that he said rates would definitely stay on hold for some time (as some papers reported)
Q: So was the speech also shared with members of the FPC? (financial policy committee)?
It wasn't - MPC speeches aren't typically shared with the FPC beforehand.

Q: Was the Federal Reserve right to raise interest rates in December?
Carney gives a long answer, arguing there is solid growth at the core of advanced economies.
And domestic inflation pressures merited the change in monetary policy, he argues.
Q: But did the rate hike cause the turmoil in the financial markets in recent weeks?
The governor says that it was not the fundamental cause, but it did contribute to it.

Carney smiles, then replies that he's certainly not planning to leave and follow Andrew Bailey to the FCA.
We are making progress at the Bank of England, but there's more work to do, the governor says. And if I were to request a longer term, I'd probably have to do so by the end of this.

 Chinese market rout: What the experts say  
Analysts are divided over the severity of the Chinese slowdown.
 Yogi Dewan, founder of Hassium Asset Management (a wealth management firm) told Bloomberg TV that China is "slowing, not melting down".
He argues that Beijing are taking some "very positive" steps, including devaluing the yuan and building close financial links with Europe. 
But Joseph Oughourlian of Amber Capital Investment Management is less optimistic. He is steering clear of companies who benefitted from China's investment boom over the last 15 years. 
 FXTM  Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says investors are worried that capital will continue to ooze out of China, as people try to escape its slowing economy: 
A re-established wave of risk aversion gripped Asian equities sending most into red territory, while elevated fears that China capital outflows may accelerate as the economy decelerates has sent the Shanghai Composite Index diving -6.3% lower, to levels not seen in 13 months.
With days like today continuing to come back to haunt the Shanghai Composite Index, the Chinese New Year period and the trading break couldn't come soon enough.

 Shares in easyJet have dropped by 2%, after the company reported that recent terror attacks have weakened demand. 
The budget airline said revenue suffered after November's Paris terror attack, and the bombing of a plane flying form Egypt's Sharm el-Sheikh.
The recent market turmoil has also been a mixed blessing for the airline. The fall in the oil price will save it £180m on fuel costs, however currency moves will wipe out £50m.
In other words, easyJet needs fewer dollars to pay for fuel, but it needs to stump up more pounds to buy the dollars first....

Tesco shareholders could sue for 'millions lost' after it overstated profits; 
Stewarts Law says it will write to supermarket before undertaking legal action to prove it misled group of 50 to 100 shareholders.

Sarah Butler.

Tesco is facing potential legal action from a group of between 50 and 100 institutional shareholders who say they lost tens of millions of pounds when the supermarket admitted it had overstated profits in 2014. 
Law firm Stewarts Law said it would shortly be writing to Tesco as a prelude to formal legal action that will seek to prove misleading statements were made to the market by the retailer, which shareholders relied on when making investment decisions.
Stewarts Law made the announcement on Tuesday after the UK supermarket regulator, the groceries code adjudicator, ruled that the supermarket had deliberately delayed payments to suppliers to support its profits.
 Related:  Tesco delayed payments to suppliers to boost profits, watchdog finds
The GCA said the company had seriously breached its code and must make "significant changes" in the way it deals with suppliers. 
Tesco is also facing potential legal action in the US, where it has already agreed a $12m (£7.94m) deal to settle one of two shareholder class action suits over its accounting scandal.
                     Stewarts Law began soliciting angry shareholders to support joint action against Tesco in September 2014, backed by Bentham Europe, an offshoot of Australian group IMF Bentham, which specialises in funding litigation.
It said it was moving forward with legal action in the light of what it claimed was "mounting evidence that Tesco's management were aware that the financial statements were untrue or misleading", including recent press reports that  the Serious Fraud Office has interviewed former senior executives and is considering agreeing a deal with Tesco.
Jeremy Marshall, chief investment officer of Bentham Europe, said: "The prospect of litigation is a necessary consequence of the apparent failure of Tesco's former management to protect their shareholders from avoidable losses. We hope the company will face up to the seeming failings of previous management and move swiftly to resolve this dispute." 
Tesco's chief executive, Dave Lewis, who joined the business in September 2014, just a few days before the accounting scandal emerged, said the company had not received any formal contact from shareholders with regard to legal action in the UK and had not made any financial provision for it.
He added that it was misleading to link the findings of a grocery watchdog inquiry, the results of which were published on Tuesday when Stewarts Law issued its press release, to the Serious Fraud Office inquiry.
"What either investigator is investigating is different and the onus of proof is completely different," he said.
There have been suggestions that the SFO could release the findings of its inquiry as early as this week. City analysts have warned that Tesco could face a £500m fine for its multi-million pound accounting scandal.

Tesco delayed payments to suppliers to boost profits, watchdog finds; 
Groceries code adjudicator finds supermarket failed to pay back multi-million pound sums owed for up to two years, but regulator is unable to levy fine.

Sarah Butler.

The grocery market watchdog has ordered Tesco to make "significant changes" in the way it deals with suppliers after finding the supermarket had deliberately delayed payments to support its profits.
Christine Tacon, the groceries code adjudicator, said Tesco had made serious breaches of the code governing the grocery market, but is unable to fine the supermarket as the breaches took place before her powers to fine were ratified.
"I was troubled to see Tesco at times prioritising its own finances over treating suppliers fairly," Tacon said. 
Tacon said she had seen internal emails suggesting payments should not be made ahead of a certain date in order to avoid missing margin targets promised to City investors. In some cases this occurred despite suppliers' requests for payment, at other times it was with their consent.
"The pressure on buyers and finance teams to meet margin targets was the overriding pressure within the business. It was widespread. It was everywhere," she said.
Tacon also criticised the company for making unilateral decisions on deducting amounts from invoice payments. She said even in circumstances where Tesco had acknowledged a debt, on occasion the money was not repaid for more than a year, or as long as two years.
The adjudicator launched the investigation in February after Tesco admitted it had overstated profits in a scandal that has also led to a Serious Fraud Office investigation.
Dave Lewis, Tesco chief executive, who joined the business in September 2014 just a few days before the accounting scandal emerged and was in post for only four months of the period investigated by Tacon, apologised to suppliers and said the retailer had "fundamentally changed".
"Over the last year we have worked hard to make Tesco a very different company from the one described in the GCA report. The absolute focus on operating margin [under former boss Phil Clarke] had damaging consequences for the business and our relationship with suppliers," he said.
Tacon said Tesco had previously "acted unreasonably" by delaying payments to suppliers, often for lengthy periods and sometimes deliberately to support its profits ahead of key financial reporting periods. For example, a list of methods for meeting a half year profit target seen by Tacon included "not paying back money owed". 
She considered Tesco's breach of the code to be serious because of the varied and widespread nature of the delays in payment. 
"The most shocking thing I found was how widespread it was. How many instances in every sector. Every supplier I spoke to had evidence of delays in payments," Tacon said. 
One supplier was owed several million pounds as a result of price changes being incorrectly applied over a long period, but Tesco took two years to refund the money.
"The sums were often significant and the length of time taken to repay them was too long," she said at the launch of her 60-plus page report. 
While in some cases the delays were due to deliberate policy, Tacon found buyers were given "contradictory and unclear" guidance about the importance of hitting margin targets. Some delays were the result of poor administration and communication and that Tesco had "inadequate processes" for correcting errors, for example where data had been input wrongly.
She has given the retailer a month to say how it plans to implement her recommendations, which include paying suppliers in accordance with agreed terms, correcting pricing errors within a week of notification by a supplier, and calling a halt to unilateral deductions from invoices - giving suppliers 30 days to challenge any proposed deduction.
The adjudicator also said Tesco must improve its invoices, making them clearer and more transparent for suppliers and to train finance teams and buyers. She said many of the problems encountered related to unclear terms in Tesco's agreements with suppliers.
Tacon said that many suppliers had reported an improvement in relations with Tesco since the period under investigation - June 2013 until February 2015.
She said she had found no evidence that Tesco had required suppliers to make payments to secure better shelf positioning or to increase the amount of space allocated to them on shelves.
However, she will launch an industry-wide consultation examining payments made by suppliers in order to participate when Tesco reviewed the range of products stocked in a particular category or to in order to be made a "category captain", where they could advise on how best to display products. She said such payments could amount to tens or even hundreds of thousands of pounds per supplier.
Tacon said: "There were a range of practices that I am concerned could amount to an indirect requirement for payment [related to positioning of products on shelves], contravening the code." 
 Related:  Suppliers scared to blow the whistle on supermarkets
Lewis said: "In 2014 we undertook our own review into certain historic practices, which were both unsustainable and harmful to our suppliers. We shared these practices with the adjudicator, and publicly apologised. Today, I would like to apologise again. We are sorry. 
We accept the report's findings, which are consistent with our own investigation. 
He said Tesco had already implemented all the recommendations of the GCA and had completely changed its practices since January 2015. He said Tesco had also stopped asking for payments related to "category captain" status or range reviews since then, but the company would look at making further changes in the light of Tacon's planned consultation. 
"We have changed the way we work by reorganising, refocusing and retraining our teams and we will continue to work in a way which is consistent with the recommendations," Lewis said.
While Tesco could not be fined, it could have been required to take out newspaper advertisements laying out its apology. Tacon said she had not used this power as Lewis had publicly apologised and Tesco's suppliers gave evidence that dealings had now improved.
The supermarket must report quarterly to the GCA on the measures she has asked it to introduce and Tacon can launch a new investigation if she finds her recommendations have not been followed through.
Anna Soubry, the business minister, said: "Christine Tacon has done a thorough and fearless investigation into a scandalous situation. Tesco say they have changed their practices and I very much hope they have. Paying smaller suppliers on time and treating them fairly is good and proper business. Late payment can hinder the growth and productivity of these suppliers and can threaten their existence."

 More US data, and this time it is more positive for the Federal Reserve. 
January's consumer confidence index came in at 98.1, better than the 96.5 expected and the 96.3 level in December.
Dennis de Jong at UFX.com said:
Despite global economic volatility, that US consumer confidence levels are higher than expected will be music to the ears of Fed Chair Janet Yellen.
The US job market has surely contributed to the feel good vibe, with unemployment at a seven year low, in addition to sinking prices at the pumps providing consumer's wallets with a much needed fillip. 
There are still dangers on the road ahead for Yellen and Co as global growth expectations have been downgraded and a strong dollar is starting to hurt US exports. However, considering the outlook for other major economies, Yellen has every right to be pleased with the start to the calendar year.

 World Bank slashes oil price forecast  
The World Bank has cut its forecast for crude oil prices for 2016 by $14 a barrel to $37, and also reduced its predictions for 37 out of 46 commodities. Phillip Inman reports:
The World Bank has slashed its forecast for oil prices this year, saying the cost of a barrel of crude will stay near its current lows for the rest of 2016.
The Washington-based institution said a glut of oil that sent prices crashing by almost half last year and another 27% this month will continue to dominate the market for the next year.
It added that warm winter weather in Europe and weaker than expected growth in China and other emerging economies will depress demand and keep the average price at $37 a barrel, down from a projection of $51 last October.
"Low prices for oil and commodities are likely to be with us for some time," said John Baffes, senior economist and lead author of the bank's commodities markets outlook. "While we see some prospect for commodity prices to rise slightly over the next two years, significant downside risks remain."
Brent crude is currently up 1.1% at $30.85 a barrel.

 US services sector slows  
More weak data for the US Federal Reserve to consider as it gathers for its first meeting since raising interest rates in December, a move many believe may have been a mistake.
The US services sector has seen its slowest growth since December 2014. The Markit initial reading for   the purchasing managers business activity index  came in at 53.7 in January. This is down from 54.3 the previous month and just below the expected 53.9. Markit said:
U.S. service providers started the year with another slowdown in business activity growth...Although still indicative of a solid increase in business activity, the headline index has now signalled weaker overall growth in four of the past five months. 
Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit said a drop in business confidence suggested things could get worse:
The survey data paint an inauspicious start to the year for the US economy.
A struggling manufacturing economy is being accompanied by a services sector where growth showed further signs of losing momentum in January even before the bad weather hit.
The data are by no means disastrous, signalling a 1.5% annualised rate of economic growth at the start of the year, but the drop in business confidence to one of its lowest levels for over five years suggests that firms are bracing themselves for worse to come. Worries about financial market volatility, the impact of slower growth overseas, a downturn in the energy sector and uncertainty about higher interest rates all took their toll and set the scene for further weakness in coming months.

 Britain's economy continues to grow pretty steadily, according to the Bank of England's chief economist Andy Haldane, and a Chinese slowdown is unlikely to push the world economy into negative growth. 
Haldane said  in an interview   with Wolverhampton's Express and Star newspaper:
We would have to fall a long way, or something very untoward would have to happen for that to fall into negative territory,.
I think that is a reasonably unlikely event. Now are there things that could happen that could slow that rate of growth? Yes there are. It's true to say there are some concerns about how rapidly the Chinese economy is growing.
These days China is of such a size and it's sufficiently well integrated into the world economy that when it sneezes there is a sense at which the world economy is at risk of catching a cold.
Does that mean there is a chance that world growth could slow from current levels? Yes, there is a chance of that.
Do I think there is a big risk of us being tipped into negative growth in the world economy? That strikes me as quite unlikely as things sit today.

A recent WEF document identified five areas which the taskforce could discuss in its first meeting: emerging markets, technologyi, regulatory and monetary policies, loss of trust in financial services and financial inclusion.
Apart from Carney the other members of the taskforce are Citgroup chief executive Michael Corbat; Blackrock chairman Laurence Fink; HSBC chairman Douglas Flint; Bank of America chairman Brian Moynihan; Raghuram Rajan, governor of the Reserve Bank of India; Min Zhu, deputy managing director of the IMF; and Liu Mingkang, economics and finance fellow at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

 Why is governor Mark Carney worrying about the current account deficit anyway? 
The current account is significant, as it shows the balance between the goods, services and financial transactions into, and out of, the UK. Britain has been running a persistent deficit for some time -- dubbed the 'invisible deficit', as the financial markets have been relaxed about it.

But historically, countries with large current account deficits have often been hit with currency crises, as investors eventually lose faith and stop buying your assets. That's what Mark Carney means when he mentions the "kindness of strangers".
A currency depreciation can actually help fix a current account deficit, as it makes imports unpleasantly expensive while helping exporters compete.
But as our economics editor Larry Elliot has argued, Britain doesn't have the manufacturing base to really profit from a Sterling crisis.

So if international investors decide not to buy UK assets, or hold the pound, if Britain's EU membership is in doubt, there could be a problem.....

 Mark Carney on Brexit, oil, and his own future   
A quick recap of the main points from the Governor of the Bank of England's appearance at parliament: 
1) Mark Carney warned that Britain's current account deficit is still a risk to financial stability, due to the current market instability and the looming referendum on EU membership. 
He warned that:
First, the general global environment has been much volatile.
Relying on the kindness of strangers is not optimal in that type of environment, and that's what is the case when you're running a 4%, 4.5% current account deficit.
And secondly, the possibility of a risk premium being attached to UK assets because of certain developments exists. And that plays into the riskiness of the situation.
Carney also agreed that "material decisions" can have an impact on financial stability, when questioned about Brexit. 
 2) Carney gave a clear hint that he might stay at the Bank of England for longer than planned. 
The governor's five-year term expires in July 2018, and he will decide this year whether to plump for a full eight-year term. 
I guess this is a new form of forward guidance....

If he does, Carney would return to the jobs market just as the IMF's top job comes up. #MediaSpeculation
 3) Carney said the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike last month has added to the turbulence in the market. 
He said that domestic inflation pressure justified the hike, but cautioned that policymakers need to be aware that safe-haven currencies, and riskier ones, could both be buffeted as commodity prices tumble.
4)   Carney said there is "no concern" at present, about direct or indirect stresses on UK banks.  He argues that new capital rules, designed to bail in investors, should protect the system. 
 5) Carney also pointed out that OPEC's ability to influence the oil prices isn't what it was ( as the plunge in the Brent crude oil price shows us )
 6) Carney has also talked himself into a trip to the cinema.  Hopefully The Big Short won't give him any flashbacks

Q: Has the MPC or FPC gathered any information on how negative interest rates might affect the UK economy?
We have thought more carefully about where the zero lower bound is, Carney replies. [ie, could they cut rates below the current record low of 0.5%?]
But the actual question of negative interest rates, and the impact on the financial system, has not arisen, as we don't think that is the prospect.

Carney says the latest financial stability report concluded that the biggest risk had moved from advanced economies to emerging economies. He still thinks that is still the case.

 Carney: 'Risk premium' could be added to UK assets  
 Rachel Reeves MP asks Carney about Britain's current account deficit, and the implications on UK trade if it leaves the EU.  
Q: Is the UK current account a growing risk, a declining risk, or a stable risk? And do you think Brexit would make it more or less of a risk?
Carney says the current account deficit has gone down somewhat, and the improvement in the European economy should mean our net foreign income improves (as Britain exports more across the Channel).
But he won't say that the riskiness has not gone down, for two reasons:
"First, the general global environment has been much volatile. 
Relying on the kindness of strangers is not optimal in that type of environment, and that's what is the case when you're running a 4%, 4.5% current account deficit.
And secondly, the possibility of a risk premium being attached to UK assets because of certain developments exists. And that plays into the riskiness of the situation.
 Carney didn't define 'certain developments', but it's pretty clear what he meant.

Q: Can OPEC survive the slump in the oil price?
Mark Carney says that OPEC's ability to influence the global supply has been diminished, given technical developments and increased supply sources (eg US shale gas).
But the competitive position of the major opec suppliers, especially Saudi Arabia, is unrivalled as they can produce oil cheaper than many others. 
So one scenario is that OPEC has some influence, but at a lower price point.

If Mark Carney does change his mind and  serve a full eight years at the Bank of England, he would leave the BoE at the end of June 2021.
That's also the summer when the managing directorship of the International Monetary Fund becomes vacant. Christine Lagarde appears to be nailed-on to do a second five-year term, starting in July 2016.
When he arrived in London, the talk was that Carney fancied a move into Canadian politics.

 Now the Treasury Committee has moved onto the new rules to handle failed banks, which will see bond-holders 'bailed in' to cover the costs of a rescue.  
Q: When will the system be ready, and will it work? 
Carney says several things need to happen.
1) Banks need to refinance debt, so that their 'bail-in-able debt' is in the right place within the organisation, to cover the cost of failure.
2) The holders of the debt need to know that they can be bailed in - he doesn't want retail bond investors to be surprised that they are now shareholders.
3) That knowledge will creates an incentive on bond-holders to ensure that banks hold enough equity to handle problems.
The aim is to be ready by 2019, says Carney, so that the 'ring-fenced', systemically important banks are protected and can keep running after a collapse, if needed. 
This process will cost billions, and it will push up funding costs. But that's the price of avoiding another huge taxpayer-funded bailout.
Q: But could the markets freeze up, leaving banks unable to protect themselves?
Carney says he's met with many bank chiefs recently ( including, I suspect, at Davos ), and confirmed they are on track with building up the capital buffers they need.
He argues that there's very little chance of one bank failure causing a systemic failure. That's more likely to be triggered by a general shock to the economy.
Right now, he insists, there are no concerns about direct or indirect stresses on major banks.

All draft speeches by MPC members are circulated in advance, as a courtesy, says Carney.

 Chinese market rout: What the experts say  
Analysts are divided over the severity of the Chinese slowdown.
 Yogi Dewan, founder of Hassium Asset Management (a wealth management firm) told Bloomberg TV that China is "slowing, not melting down".
He argues that Beijing are taking some "very positive" steps, including devaluing the yuan and building close financial links with Europe. 
But Joseph Oughourlian of Amber Capital Investment Management is less optimistic. He is steering clear of companies who benefitted from China's investment boom over the last 15 years. 
 FXTM  Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says investors are worried that capital will continue to ooze out of China, as people try to escape its slowing economy: 
A re-established wave of risk aversion gripped Asian equities sending most into red territory, while elevated fears that China capital outflows may accelerate as the economy decelerates has sent the Shanghai Composite Index diving -6.3% lower, to levels not seen in 13 months.

The budget airline said revenue suffered after November's Paris terror attack, and the bombing of a plane flying form Egypt's Sharm el-Sheikh.
The recent market turmoil has also been a mixed blessing for the airline. The fall in the oil price will save it £180m on fuel costs, however currency moves will wipe out £50m.

Tesco shareholders could sue for 'millions lost' after it overstated profits; 
Stewarts Law says it will write to supermarket before undertaking legal action to prove it misled group of 50 to 100 shareholders.

Sarah Butler.

Tesco is facing potential legal action from a group of between 50 and 100 institutional shareholders who say they lost tens of millions of pounds when the supermarket overstated profits in 2014. 
Law firm Stewarts Law said it would shortly be writing to Tesco as a prelude to formal legal action that will seek to prove misleading statements were made to the market by the retailer, which shareholders had relied on when making investment decisions.
Stewarts Law made the announcement on Tuesday after the UK supermarket regulator, the groceries code adjudicator, ruled that the supermarket had deliberately delayed payments to suppliers to support its profits.
 Related:  Tesco delayed payments to suppliers to boost profits, watchdog finds
The GCA said the company had made serious breaches of its code and must make "significant changes" in the way it deals with suppliers. 
Tesco is also facing potential legal action in the US, where it has already agreed a $12m (£7.94m) deal to settle one of two shareholder class action suits over its accounting scandal.
                     Stewarts Law began soliciting angry shareholders to support joint action against Tesco in September 2014, backed by Bentham Europe, an offshoot of Australian group IMF Bentham, which specialises in funding litigation.
It said it was moving forward with legal action in the light of what it claimed was "mounting evidence that Tesco's management were aware that the financial statements were untrue or misleading", including recent press reports that  the Serious Fraud Office has interviewed former senior executives and is considering agreeing a deal with Tesco.
Jeremy Marshall, chief investment officer of Bentham Europe, said: "The prospect of litigation is a necessary consequence of the apparent failure of Tesco's former management to protect their shareholders from avoidable losses. We hope the company will face up to the seeming failings of previous management and move swiftly to resolve this dispute."

Russia's verdict on BBC's War and Peace: 'a classic with cleavage'; 
Critics in the Russian media respond with praise, amusement and raised eyebrows at the adaptation's more explicit scenes.

Jessica Elgot.

Russian reviewers have responded with both praise and barely concealed amusement to the BBC's adaptation of War and Peace, with reviewers describing it as a "medium-budget soap opera" and a "classic with cleavage".
 Related:  War and Peace: the 10 things you need to know (if you haven't actually read it) 
One review of the Tolstoy adaptation starring Paul Dano and Lily James said eyebrows had been raised in Russia at the risque scenes. St Petersburg news website Fontanka.ru said one dress was so low cut, the actor's cleavage looked like it would "fall on the dinner plate".
Leo Tolstoy's four-volume novel set during Napoleon's 1812 invasion is deeply lodged in Russia's collective psyche, and it was once compulsory to read the 1,000-page book in schools. 
The BBC series, written by Andrew Davies and watched by 6 million viewers, has not yet aired in Russia, but many have sought out episodes online, Russian media reported. 
Many reviews commented on the decision by Davies and the BBC to skirt over many of the sprawling subplots and focus on the romance - including spotlighting the hints of an incestuous relationship between brother and sister Anatole and HÈlËne Kuragin.
Davies admitted he had made the relationship more explicit by showing Tuppence Middleton and Callum Turner, who play the siblings, in bed together.
For at least one Russian tabloid, the scene did not go far enough. "The promised incest scene came in the first episode," wrote Komsomolskaya Pravda, offering a "hint of scandal".
"Anatole strokes his sister under a blanket," it continued. The "prim English evidently decided not to arouse the feelings of literature lovers" by "not showing the viewers everything".
                     Davies said it was crucial to include the incestuous relationship in his adaptation. "HÈlËne and Anatole are in an incestuous relationship, but Tolstoy indicates this so subtly that most readers, including me, at first reading, miss it altogether," he told the Radio Times.
"This relationship, and their attitude to it, is so crucial to our understanding of them that for me, at least, it needs to be on screen."
Some critics compared the series unfavourably to Sergei Bondarchuk's 1966 version, which won an Oscar for best foreign-language film. 
Rossiiskaya Gazeta, a state-owned newspaper, said the BBC's version was "not a patch" on Bondarchuk's, and that it lacked reverence for Tolstoy's text. It described it as a "medium-budget soap opera" more focused on fawning beauties, glasses clinking and magnificent balls than on the philosophy of the human spirit and endurance.
Others welcomed a simpler, more erotic version to introduce non-readers and a younger audience to the sweeping saga, especially the charged sex scene between the married HÈlËne and her playboy lover Fedya Dolokhov.
"On a formally laid table, the cutlery shakes rhythmically ... the passionate Fedya Dolokhov, eyes shining insolently, thrusts himself upon [her]," said Fontanka.ru. 
"Now the great novel will not only be more accessible but also more interesting," the reviewer quipped.
Reviews in the UK also opined that the sexed-up series was not one to be taken too seriously. "Bosoms heaving? Sabres flashing? Lucrative foreign sales projected? Check, check, check," wrote the Guardian's Stuart Jeffries. 
In Russia, reviewers also praised Dano's performance as Pierre Bezukhov, with Meduza.ru calling it "the main success of the series ... an absolutely exact match and probably the most fleshed-out character."
Entertainment website Afisha was less positive about James as Natasha Rostova, saying she merely "wears a fringe and smiles in a cute way".
That verdict on James's performance is strikingly similar to that of the Telegraph's Serena Davies, who gave the series four stars but said James's performance was the "biggest concern: although she can flutter and flirt with the best of them, I doubt she's the tragedian required for the story's later chapters."

The series is clearly aimed at those who have not read the book and are unlikely ever to do so, the Russian reviewer for Afisha continued, but conceded the series as a whole was "fresh, bombastic, beautiful and clever in a British way".
If there was a theme to the Russian criticism, it was that the series did not feel Russian enough, even the scenes filmed in St Petersburg, which Meduza.ru said was barely recognisable.
The feeling it evokes is "neither that of a Russian village, nor glittering St Petersburg, nor hospitable and extravagant Moscow", wrote Izvestia's reviewer. "The adaptation lacks the most important thing: atmosphere."
The Guardian's review drew the same conclusion. "The adaptation's biggest problem? It was too English. It took the deep-voiced Russian choruses that punctuated some scenes and the shots of CGI sailing ships frozen on the Neva, to remind me War and Peace was set not in Georgian England but tsarist Russia," Jeffries wrote.

Tesco delayed payments to suppliers to boost profits, watchdog finds; 
Groceries code adjudicator finds supermarket failed to pay back multi-million pound sums owed for up to two years, but regulator is unable to levy fine.

Sarah Butler.

The grocery market watchdog has ordered Tesco to make "significant changes" in the way it deals with suppliers after finding the supermarket had deliberately delayed payments to support its profits.
Christine Tacon, the groceries code adjudicator, said Tesco had made serious breaches of the code governing the grocery market, but is unable to fine the supermarket as the breaches took place before her powers to fine were ratified.
"I was troubled to see Tesco at times prioritising its own finances over treating suppliers fairly," Tacon said. 
Tacon said she had seen internal emails suggesting payments should not be made ahead of a certain date in order to avoid missing margin targets. In some cases this occurred despite suppliers' requests for payment, at other times it was with their consent.
She also criticised the company for making unilateral decisions on deducting amounts from invoice payments. She said even in circumstances where Tesco had acknowledged a debt, on occasion the money was not repaid for more than a year, or as long as two years.
The adjudicator launched the investigation in February after Tesco admitted it had overstated profits in a scandal that has also led to a Serious Fraud Office investigation.
Dave Lewis, Tesco chief executive, who joined the business in September 2014 just a few days before the accounting scandal emerged and was in post for only four months of the period investigated by Tacon, apologised to suppliers and said the retailer had "fundamentally changed".
"Over the last year we have worked hard to make Tesco a very different company from the one described in the GCA report. The absolute focus on operating margin had damaging consequences for the business and our relationship with suppliers," he said.
Tacon said Tesco had previously "acted unreasonably" by delaying payments to suppliers, often for lengthy periods and sometimes deliberately to support its profits ahead of key financial reporting periods. 
She considered Tesco's breach of the code to be serious because of the varied and widespread nature of the delays in payment. 
"The most shocking thing I found was how widespread it was. How many instances in every sector. Every supplier I spoke to had evidence of delays in payments," Tacon said. 
One supplier was owed several million pounds as a result of price changes being incorrectly applied over a long period, but Tesco took two years to refund the money.
"The sums were often significant and the length of time taken to repay them was too long," she said at the launch of her 60-plus page report. 
While in some cases the delays were due to deliberate policy, Tacon found buyers were given "contradictory and unclear" guidance about the importance of hitting margin targets. Some delays were the result of poor administration and communication and that Tesco had "inadequate processes" for correcting errors, for example where data had been input wrongly.
She has given the retailer a month to say how it plans to implement her recommendations, which include paying suppliers in accordance with agreed terms, correcting pricing errors within a week of notification by a supplier, and calling a halt to unilateral deductions from invoices - giving suppliers given 30 days to challenge any proposed deduction.
The adjudicator also said Tesco must improve its invoices, making them clearer and more transparent for suppliers and to train finance teams and buyers. She said many of the problems encountered related to unclear terms in Tesco's agreements with suppliers.
Tacon said that many suppliers had reported an improvement in relations with Tesco since the period under investigation - June 2013 until February 2015.
She said she had found no evidence that Tesco had required suppliers to make payments to secure better shelf positioning or to increase the amount of space allocated to them on shelves.
However, she will launch a consultation examining payments made by suppliers in order to participate when Tesco reviewed the range of products stocked in a particular category or to in order to be made a "category captain", where they could advise on how best to display products. She said such payments could amount to tens or even hundreds of thousands of pounds per supplier.
Tacon said: "There were a range of practices that I am concerned could amount to an indirect requirement for payment [related to positioning of products on shelves], contravening the code." 
 Related:  Suppliers scared to blow the whistle on supermarkets
Lewis said: "In 2014 we undertook our own review into certain historic practices, which were both unsustainable and harmful to our suppliers. We shared these practices with the adjudicator, and publicly apologised. Today, I would like to apologise again. We are sorry.
"I am grateful to the adjudicator for the professional manner in which the investigation has been conducted. We accept the report's findings, which are consistent with our own investigation. 
"In January 2015, we made material changes to our business that addressed the majority of the historic practices referred to in the report. We have changed the way we work by reorganising, refocusing and retraining our teams and we will continue to work in a way which is consistent with the recommendations." 
While Tesco could not be fined, it could have been required to take out newspaper advertisements laying out its apology. Tacon said she had not used this power as Lewis had publicly apologised and Tesco's suppliers gave evidence that dealings had now improved.
The supermarket must report quarterly to the GCA on the measures she has asked it to introduce and Tacon can launch a new investigation if she finds her recommendations have not been followed through.
Anna Soubry, the business minister, said: "Christine Tacon has done a thorough and fearless investigation into a scandalous situation. Tesco say they have changed their practices and I very much hope they have. Paying smaller suppliers on time and treating them fairly is good and proper business. Late payment can hinder the growth and productivity of these suppliers and can threaten their existence."

The story of Ted Pooley and why there is no easy fix for cricket's scandals; 
Cricket has always been a game for gamblers, and so long as that's the case, you can no more eradicate fixing than you can avarice.

Andy Bull.

A GAMBLING MAN
The first time Edward 'Ted' Pooley died, it was liver cancer that killed him. That was in Brighton in 1899, when he was 57. "Surrey Cricketer Dead," the papers said. Problem being, Pooley was still alive and living at that point in Lambeth Infirmary, where he was receiving treatment for his rheumatic gout. So Pooley enjoyed the unusual privilege of reading his own obituaries, which described the "free and resolute batting" of this "once-famous cricketer". Eight years later, Pooley was 12 years older, having since admitted that he'd been lying about his age ever since he started playing cricket professionally. He was still in Lambeth Infirmary, next door to the poorhouse, when he died for the second time, of "paralysis and complications". This, then, was one of those rare occasions when newspapers were able to take a second go at that "rough first draft of history" which is their daily business.  
Again, they mentioned Pooley's attacking batting and his deft 'keeping, especially to the slow bowlers. They told the story of how he got his start, how he had started as a slow bowler but had persuaded his skipper to give him a try behind the stumps though he had never done it before. And how he once dismissed 12 batsmen in the match against Sussex, eight caught and four stumped, still a record in English first class cricket. And the 93 he made in Canterbury week while batting with a broken finger. In Wisden, his obituarist reckoned "two or three pages" of the Almanack "could easily be filled with details of his doings". Odd thing was, most of the write-ups omitted the one detail Pooley would come to be remembered for, even now, a century after his death. Ted Pooley was at the centre of one of international cricket's very first betting scandals.
If Pooley is known at all now, it is because he should have been in England's team for the very first Test, against Australia at Melbourne in 1877. But he missed it, because he was in a prison cell in Christchurch. Pooley was a gambling man, though he often tried to deny it. He was once involved in what one of his obituaries described as "a certain unpleasantness" in a match against Yorkshire at Bramall Lane, when he was accused of trying to lose. "I never was a gambler on cricket," Pooley said. But Surrey suspended him when it was proven that he had won a bottle of champagne in a wager with a colleague. Pooley had it with his breakfast and so had to be replaced as 'keeper just after lunch. Despite that, Pooley was picked by James Lillywhite for England's tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1876-77. 
In Christchurch, England were due to play 18 men of Canterbury, in what they called an "odds match", the bookmakers' prices published in the local papers. Pooley struck a wager with a man named Ralph Donkin. He bet Donkin a shilling apiece that each of Canterbury's 18 batsmen would be out for a duck. A fair bet, but for the fact that Pooley was injured and unable to play, so stood as umpire instead. In the end 11 men were out for nought, and Pooley won a healthy sum. Donkin refused to pay. He said that he had declared the bet off before the game. So Pooley punched him three times in the face. Donkin later accused Pooley of breaking into his hotel room and trashing his belongings. Pooley was arrested, along with England's kit man, Alfred Bramhall, and a trial scheduled. The team travelled on to Melbourne without them, and John Selby took over as wicketkeeper for the first Test. Pooley was eventually found not guilty of destroying Donkin's property. He travelled back to England with Bramhall, arriving home a month after the rest of the team. 
The scandal hardly seemed to make the British papers. The Times later mentioned that Lillywhite's team has "laboured under the tremendous handicap of having to take the field without their wicket-keeper", because he was "mixed up in a fracas". His obituaries didn't mention it, either time he died, just as they glossed over the circumstances that caused him to fetch up in the poorhouse. "The faults of private character that marred Pooley's career and were the cause of the poverty in which he spent the later years of his life there is no need now to speak," noted Wisden. "He was in many ways his own enemy, but even to the last he had a geniality and sense of humour that to a certain extent condoned his weaknesses." 
Pooley's story is always worth returning to, a reminder that cricket has always been a game for gamblers. And so long as that's the case, you can no more eradicate fixing than you can avarice. Sri Lanka have just suspended their fast bowling coach, Anusha Samaranayake, because he has been accused of trying to help fix the first Test against West Indies at Galle last October. Samaranayake is alleged to have brought a new net bowler, Gayan Vishwajith into the team set-up, though he had no serious experience at top-level cricket. Vishwajith has been accused of trying to bribe two players to throw the game. Galle's groundsman, Jayananda Warnaweera, also has been suspended for three years by the ICC because he failed to co-operate with an investigation into fixing. In South Africa Gulam Bodi has been banned for 20 years after he admitted to attempting to fix matches in the Ram Slam T20. 
In New Zealand, Mohammad Amir has just taken three for 28 in his first ODI since he came back into cricket. And in Pakistan, Salman Butt has been in fine form for the Water and Power Development Authority, with successive scores of 135, 99*, 6, 30, 81*, 95 and 90. Mohammad Asif, playing for the same side, has been a little less impressive while opening the bowling. The authorities felt unable to impose a lifetime ban on any of them, partly because the prospect of a comeback served as an inducement to secure their co-operation in their investigations. All exist, then, in this uneasy twilight, neither entirely condemned or entirely condoned, guilty, but playing again. Like Pooley. Only you wonder whether their obituary writers will be so forgiving.

 Carney: 'Risk premium' could be added to UK assets  
 Rachel Reeves MP asks Carney about Britain's current account deficit, and the implications on UK trade if it leaves the EU.  
Q: Is the UK current account a growing risk, a declining risk, or a stable risk? And do you think Brexit would make it more or less of a risk?
Carney says the current account deficit has gone down somewhat, and the improvement in the European economy should mean our net foreign income improves (as Britain exports more across the Channel).
But he won't say that the riskiness has not gone down, for two reasons:
"First, the general global environment has been much more ephemeral, much more volatile. 
Relying on the kindness of strangers is not optimal in that type of environment, and that's what is the case when you're running a 4%, 4.5% current account deficit.
And secondly, the possibility of a risk premium being attached to UK assets because of certain developments exists. And that plays into the riskiness of the situation.
 Carney didn't define 'certain developments', but it's pretty clear what he meant.

Mark Carney says that OPEC's ability to influence the global supply has been diminished, given technical developments and increased supply sources (eg US shale gas).
But the competitive position of the major opec suppliers, especially Saudi Arabia, is unrivalled as they can produce oil cheaper than many others. 
So one scenario is that OPEC has some influence, but at a lower price point.

 Now the Treasury has moved onto the new rules to handle failed banks, which will see bond-holders 'bailed in' to cover the costs of a rescue.  
Q: When will the system be ready, and will it work? 
Carney says several things need to happen.
1) Banks need to refinance debt, so that their 'bail-in-able debt' is in the right place within the organisation, to cover the cost of failure.
2) The holders of the debt need to know that they can be bailed in - he doesn't want retail bond investors to be surprised that they are now shareholders.
3) That knowledge will creates an incentive on bond-holders to ensure that banks hold enough equity to handle problems.
The aim is to be ready by 2019, says Carney, so that the 'ring-fenced', systemically important banks are protected and can keep running after a collapse, if needed. 
This process will cost billions, and it will push up funding costs. But that's the price of avoiding another huge taxpayer-funded bailout.
Q: But could the markets freeze up, leaving banks unable to protect themselves?
Carney says he's met with many bank chiefs recently ( including, I suspect, at Davos ), and confirmed they are on track with building up the capital buffers they need.
He argues that there's very little chance of one bank failure causing a systemic failure. That's more likely to be triggered by a general shock to the economy.
Right now, he insists, there are no concerns about direct or indirect stresses on major banks.

All draft speeches by MPC members are circulated in advance, as a courtesy, says Carney.

Q: So was the speech also shared with members of the FPC? (financial policy committee)?
It wasn't - MPC speeches aren't typically shared with the FPC beforehand.

 Chinese market rout: What the experts say  
Analysts are divided over the severity of the Chinese slowdown.
 Yogi Dewan, founder of Hassium Asset Management (a wealth management firm) told Bloomberg TV that China is "slowing, not melting down".
He argues that Beijing are taking some "very positive" steps, including devaluing the yuan and building close financial links with Europe. 
But Joseph Oughourlian of Amber Capital Investment Management is less optimistic. He is steering clear of companies who benefitted from China's investment boom over the last 15 years. 
 FXTM  Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says investors are worried that capital will continue to ooze out of China, as people try to escape its slowing economy: 
A re-established wave of risk aversion gripped Asian equities sending most into red territory, while elevated fears that China capital outflows may accelerate as the economy decelerates has sent the Shanghai Composite Index diving -6.3% lower, to levels not seen in 13 months.
With days like today continuing to come back to haunt the Shanghai Composite Index, the Chinese New Year period and the trading break couldn't come soon enough.

The budget airline said revenue suffered after November's Paris terror attack, and the bombing of a plane flying form Egypt's Sharm el-Sheikh.
The recent market turmoil has also been a mixed blessing for the airline. The fall in the oil price will save it £180m on fuel costs, however currency moves will wipe out £50m.
In other words, easyJet needs fewer dollars to pay for fuel, but it needs to stump up more pounds to buy the dollars first....

The fall in oil prices will make most of the headlines and drive most of the movement in markets today, unless it is reversed for no particularly good reason.

Spike in mental health patient deaths shows NHS 'struggling to cope'; 
MP Norman Lamb likens rise of over 20% in the unexpected deaths of mentally ill people in NHS care to Mid Staffs scandal and calls for investigation.

Denis Campbell Health policy editor.

A sudden spike in the number of mental health patients dying unexpectedly in NHS care has prompted calls for a wide-ranging investigation into "threadbare" services that are "struggling to cope".
New NHS figures show that the number of deaths annually among mental health patients in England has risen 21% over the last three years from 1,412 to 1,713. 
 Related:  'I didn't matter': the long wait for mental health treatment 
The number of those killing themselves or trying to do so has also increased, by 26% from 595 in 2012-13 to 751 in 2014-15. It covers both those being treated as inpatients for serious mental health problems and also those who are being cared for while still living at home. 
Figures obtained by Norman Lamb, the Liberal Democrat MP, show that the overall number of "serious incidents" - involving unexpected or avoidable deaths, serious harm, injury and abuse - has climbed 34% to 8,139 a year. They have become so common that one trust, North East London foundation trust, had a total of 633 last year - almost two a day. 
Lamb, the mental health minister in the coalition until last May, made the comparison with the Mid Staffordshire scandal in which patients died as a result of poor care.
 Related:  Tackling mental illness early: the people being taught to spot warning signs
"Significant numbers of unexpected deaths at the Mid Staffs NHS trust caused an outcry and these figures should cause the same because they show a dramatic increase in the number of people losing their lives," Lamb said.
"NHS England and the government should set up an investigation into the causes of this as these figures involve tragedies for families around the country and the human impact is intense." 
Underfunding of sometimes threadbare mental health services which are struggling to cope with rising demand for care is to blame, Lamb claimed. 
The way the NHS collects such figures has changed since 2014-15. But figures for the first six months of 2015-16 show a continued upward trend, with 1,132 serious incidents recorded as involving an unexpected or potentially avoidable death. 
Paul Farmer, chief executive of the charity Mind and also the chair of NHS England's mental health taskforce, said that even if better reporting partly explained the rises, "the figures give us real cause for concern".
 Membership Event:  Guardian Live | How do we pay for NHS we want?
"We know, for example, that suicides among people in touch with crisis resolution and home treatment teams - which are there to support people in crisis to stay in their own homes rather than be admitted to hospital - have increased significantly. 
"These teams have in recent years been starved of funding and in some cases have been disbanded altogether or else merged into community teams, losing their specialist function, at a time of rising demand," Farmer added. 
Every unexpected death should be investigated so that lessons can be learned to prevent future loss of life, he urged. 
But Prof Sir Simon Wessely, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said the apparent dramatic increases were due primarily to staff and trusts reporting more such events when they happen. 
By almost every metric, the number of people with mental health problems in the UK has surged in recent years, leaving NHS services simply unable to deal with the volumes. The numbers of people in contact with mental health services has jumped by more than 40% over the past decade, while the number of antidepressant prescriptions have surged by more than 100% in the same period.
But the government has been accused of cutting millions of pounds from mental health funding. An attempt to concentrate efforts on talking therapies by increasing the numbers of psychotherapists has produced mixed results. 
Many long-term patients describe a byzantine system of long waiting times, lack of psychiatrists, overreliance on pills as an easy solution and a sense of limbo for all but the most severe cases. 
Matters have not been helped by the fact that limited staffing numbers have fallen even further in recent years. The number of specialist mental health nurses has fallen more than 10% over the past five years, the Guardian has learned.
 Related:  Number of mental health nurses falls 10%
The loss of one in 10 of the entire mental health nursing workforce in England has occurred mainly in hospitals and mental health units treating some of the sickest patients, official NHS figures show.
Figures from the NHS's health and social care information centre, obtained through a parliamentary question, show that the number of qualified nurses working in psychiatry dropped by 10.8% from 41,320 in 2010 to 36,870 in 2015.
While the number working in community psychiatry services has fallen only slightly from 15,986 to 15,826, those listed as working in "other psychiatry" - mainly hospital units - went down from 25,334 to 21,044.
"These shocking figures raise serious concerns about the future of our mental health services," said Luciana Berger,the shadow minister for mental health. "At a time when there is growing demand and staff are being asked to do more for less, cuts to the number of nurses working in mental health are completely unacceptable."
NHS England declined to comment directly on Lamb's figures. A spokeswoman said: "Reporting of incidents is intentionally up right across the NHS, including mental health, as part of our national effort to encourage transparency and a culture of learning.
"That's the lesson from the airlines - openness is a precondition for safety and improvement. That's as true for mental health services as it is for maternity care or surgical operations."

∑ This article was amended on 26 January 2016. Because of an editing error, an earlier version said hundreds of  patients had died as a result of poor care by Mid Staffordshire NHS trust. Sir Robert Francis QC concluded in his reports on care at the trust that it would be unsafe to infer from mortality statistics, on which the figures were based, that there was any particular number of avoidable or unnecessary deaths at the trust.

The Red Shoe by Ursula Dubosarsky - review; 
'I'm not sure what this book was about. But I know I love it'.

Sophie Scribe.

I'm not sure what this book was about. But I know I love it.
To me, that isn't a contradiction. A book is made to be pondered - it should cause a change in you, make you think, question yourself. A joyful feeling of confusion at the end, replaced by a warm feeling of certainty as you decide what it meant to you.  
We are teenagers - we aren't stupid. Sadly, in too many YA books, that has been lost, replaced by racing plots that keep the senses engaged but the reader's brain far behind. Perhaps this is what gave The Red Shoe its vague sense of 'old-fashionedness' that sat in perfect harmony with its 1950s Australian setting.
It's told from the perspective of Matilda, a six year old girl living on an ordinary street, in an ordinary family. She wakes up, goes to school and plays with her sisters. Her world is governed by Floreal, her imaginary friend who speaks words of wisdom - often things she'd rather not hear. 
Yet Matilda is growing up, and through her we catch glimpses of the confusing mess that is the adult's world. Her depressed father is fighting in the war and her mother might be having an affair with her uncle. Her older sister has had a nervous breakdown. A boy at her school dies from polio. The way a young child sees and deals with this is one part of the story. 
Despite her young age, she understands the truth better than most of the other characters - it may seem to be a simple book, but in reality it is exactly the opposite, making you think more deeply about the effect war has on those left behind.
The other part of the story focusses on her neighbours, who drive a big black car and have sunglasses and umbrellas. Of course, to Matilda this means they are spies. To start with, I laughed this off as the delusions of a young girl, even after reading the newspaper clippings interposed throughout the story. They contain all sorts of mundane news, but towards the middle of the book begin to talk about a Russian spy ring in Australia (having done a bit of research, this was a famous Australian political scandal in the Cold War, called the Petrov Affair). However, having finished the book I am no longer so sure she was mistaken... you will have to read it to decide for yourself! 
 Related:  How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?
It may have a lot of negative reviews, but I think that if you can get over the decided lack of plot, it is an intriguing and rather sad short read that you will never forget.

Q: Can OPEC survive the slump in the oil price? 
Mark Carney says that OPEC's ability to influence the global supply has been diminished, given technical developments and increased supply sources (eg US shale gas).
But the competitive position of the major opec suppliers, especially Saudi Arabia, is unrivalled as they can produce oil cheaper than many others. 
So one scenario is that OPEC has some influence, but at a lower price point.

 Back in the committee room, Mark Carney has been fielding questions about market turbulence, and the oil price. 
We are in an environment of "heightened risk aversion" which could continue for some time, says the BoE governor.

If Mark Carney does change his mind and  serve a full eight years at the Bank of England, he would leave the BoE at the end of June 2021.
That's also the summer when the managing directorship of the International Monetary Fund becomes vacant. Christine Lagarde appears to be nailed-on to do a second five-year term, starting in July 2016.
When he arrived in London, the talk was that Carney fancied a move into Canadian politics.

 Now the Treasury has moved onto the new rules to handle failed banks, which will see bond-holders 'bailed in' to cover the costs of a rescue.  
Q: When will the system be ready, and will it work? 
Carney says several things need to happen.
1) Banks need to refinance debt, so that their 'bail-in-able debt' is in the right place within the organisation, to cover the cost of failure.
2) The holders of the debt need to know that they can be bailed in - he doesn't want retail bond investors to be surprised that they are now shareholders.
3) That knowledge will creates an incentive on bond-holders to ensure that banks hold enough equity to handle problems.
The aim is to be ready by 2019, says Carney, so that the 'ring-fenced', systemically important banks are protected and can keep running after a collapse, if needed. 
This process will cost billions, and it will push up funding costs. But that's the price of avoiding another huge taxpayer-funded bailout.
Q: But could the markets freeze up, leaving banks unable to protect themselves?
Carney says he's met with many bank chiefs recently ( including, I suspect, at Davos ), and confirmed they are on track with building up the capital buffers they need.
He argues that there's very little chance of one bank failure causing a systemic failure. That's more likely to be triggered by a general shock to the economy.
Right now, he insists, there are no concerns about direct or indirect stresses on major banks.

Q: Carney is then asked who, if anyone, he consulted before giving a speech last week saying that it's not time to raise interest rates ?

Q: But did you discuss it with anyone on the MPC (monetary policy committee)?
All draft speeches by MPC members are circulated in advance, as a courtesy, says Carney. 
And he denies that he said rates would definitely stay on hold for some time (as some papers reported)
Q: So was the speech also shared with members of the FPC? (financial policy committee)?
It wasn't - MPC speeches aren't typically shared with the FPC beforehand.

 Chinese market rout: What the experts say  
Analysts are divided over the severity of the Chinese slowdown.
 Yogi Dewan, founder of Hassium Asset Management (a wealth management firm) told Bloomberg TV that China is "slowing, not melting down".
He argues that Beijing are taking some "very positive" steps, including devaluing the yuan and building close financial links with Europe. 
But Joseph Oughourlian of Amber Capital Investment Management is less optimistic. He is steering clear of companies who benefitted from China's investment boom over the last 15 years. 
 FXTM  Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga says investors are worried that capital will continue to ooze out of China, as people try to escape its slowing economy: 
A re-established wave of risk aversion gripped Asian equities sending most into red territory, while elevated fears that China capital outflows may accelerate as the economy decelerates has sent the Shanghai Composite Index diving -6.3% lower, to levels not seen in 13 months.
With days like today continuing to come back to haunt the Shanghai Composite Index, the Chinese New Year period and the trading break couldn't come soon enough.

The fall in oil prices will make most of the headlines and drive most of the movement in markets today, unless it is reversed for no particularly good reason. The latest driver is the news that Iraqi oil output is strong. US production remains the key swing on supply and is what will eventually trigger a turn.

Tesco failed to treat suppliers fairly, watchdog rules; 
Grocery Code Adjudicator finds supermarket deliberately delayed payments to suppliers in some cases to boost profits but regulator is unable to levy fine.

Sarah Butler.

The grocery market watchdog has ordered Tesco to make "significant changes" in the way it deals with suppliers after finding the supermarket had deliberately delayed payments to support its profits.
Christine Tacon, the Grocery Code Adjudicator, said Tesco had made serious breaches of the code governing the grocery market, but is unable to fine the supermarket as the breaches took place before her powers to fine were ratified.
"I was troubled to see Tesco at times prioritising its own finances over treating suppliers fairly," Tacon said. 
Tacon said she had seen internal emails suggesting payments should not be made ahead of a certain date in order to avoid missing margin targets. In some case this occurred despite suppliers' requests for payment, at other times it was with their consent.
 Related:  Tesco suppliers say retailer worst at following grocery code of practice
The adjudicator launched the investigation in February after Tesco admitted it had over-stated profits in a scandal that has also led to a Serious Fraud Office investigation.
Tacon said Tesco "acted unreasonably" by delaying payments to suppliers, often for lengthy periods and sometimes deliberately to support its profits ahead of key financial reporting periods. 
She also criticised the company for making unilateral decisions on deducting amounts from invoice payments. She said even in circumstances where Tesco had acknowledged a debt, on occasion the money was not repaid for more than a year or as long as two years.
Tacon said she considered Tesco's breach of the code to be serious because of the varied and widespread nature of the delays in payment. 
One supplier was owed several million pounds as a result of price changes being incorrectly applied over a long period but Tesco took two years to refund the money.
"The sums were often significant and the length of time taken to repay them was too long," she said at the launch of her 60-plus page report. 
 Related:  Supermarkets behaving badly - how suppliers can get a fairer deal
While in some cases the delays were due to deliberate policy, Tacon found buyers were given "contradictory and unclear" guidance about the importance of hitting margin targets. Some delays were the result of poor administration and communication and that Tesco had "inadequate processes" for correcting errors, for example where data had been input wrongly.
She has given the retailer a month to say how it plans to implement her recommendations which include paying suppliers in accordance with agreed terms, correcting pricing errors within a week of notification by a supplier and calling a halt to unilateral deductions from invoices - giving suppliers given 30 days to challenge any proposed deduction.
The adjudicator also said Tesco must improve its invoices, making them clearer and more transparent for suppliers and to train finance teams and buyers.
Tacon said that many suppliers had reported an improvement in relations with Tesco since the period under investigation - June 2013 until February 2015.
She said she had found no evidence that Tesco had required suppliers to make payments to secure better shelf positioning or to increase the amount of space allocated to them on shelves.
Dave Lewis, the Tesco CEO, said: "In 2014 we undertook our own review into certain historic practices, which were both unsustainable and harmful to our suppliers. We shared these practices with the adjudicator, and publicly apologised. Today, I would like to apologise again. We are sorry.
"I am grateful to the adjudicator for the professional manner in which the investigation has been conducted. We accept the report's findings, which are consistent with our own investigation. 
 Related:  Suppliers scared to blow the whistle on supermarkets
 "Over the last year we have worked hard to make Tesco a very different company from the one described in the GCA report. The absolute focus on operating margin had damaging consequences for the business and our relationship with suppliers. This has now been fundamentally changed.
"In January 2015, we made material changes to our business that addressed the majority of the historic practices referred to in the report. We have changed the way we work by reorganising, refocusing and retraining our teams and we will continue to work in a way which is consistent with the recommendations." 
Anna Soubry, the business minister, said: "Christine Tacon has done a thorough and fearless investigation into a scandalous situation. Tesco say they have changed their practices and I very much hope they have. Paying smaller suppliers on time and treating them fairly is good and proper business. Late payment can hinder the growth and productivity of these suppliers and can threaten their existence."

Film studios' television arm to be led by Helen Gregory, whose credits include Sky's Fortitude and the BBC's The Last Kingdom and Scandal.

Mark Sweney.

Pinewood, home to the Star Wars and James Bond films, is to expand beyond its Hollywood heartland with the launch of a new TV division that will fund and develop high-end drama series. 
Pinewood Television, which will invest in shows with a minimum budget of £1m an episode, will be led by Helen Gregory whose credits include Sky's Fortitude, the BBC's The Last Kingdom and Scandal, and Grey's Anatomy creator Shonda Rimes's upcoming series The Catch.
"The global demand for high-end television continues to rise dramatically and, with high end TV fiscal incentives available [tax credits], the Pinewood television business will participate in this growing market," said Ivan Dunleavy, chief executive of Pinewood Group.
Pinewood Television is a joint venture with media investment company StoryFirst, which has previous investments including the Russian version of Hello! magazine, Hello! TV and Sony Pictures Cable Channels.
"We look forward to a long and fruitful partnership with Pinewood, developing and building Pinewood Television into world class originator and owner of high quality television drama," said Peter Gerwe, chief executive of StoryFirst. 
Last year, Pinewood invested in Amazon's first UK original drama, period fashion drama The Collection. 
Pinewood also advises the Isle of Man and Welsh governments' TV and film investment funds.

Photoplay magazine: the birth of celebrity culture; 
The symbiotic relationship between film studios and fan magazines ensured the cinema-going public was fed a diet of Hollywood glamour and celebrity gossip.

Pamela Hutchinson.

From press junkets to gossip blogs to the Forbes list, celebrity culture seeps into every corner of the modern film business. Star worship, like almost everything else in Hollywood, was born as a studio boss's cynical wheeze. It all began in 1910 when the name of the Biograph Girl was released to the public. The Independent Moving Pictures studio boss, Carl Laemmle, went so far as to spread a rumour that the Girl had been killed in a traffic accident, before taking out adverts in newspapers calling the story a lie and announcing that she was, in fact, alive and about to play the lead in a film made by his company, which had lured her away from its rival, Biograph. And by the way, her name was Florence Lawrence.
A few years later, the job of rumours and newspaper adverts was taken up by fan magazines, which fed details of the movie business and of stars' private lives to eager readers once a month. The first film magazines, such as Moving Picture World, established in 1907, were written for exhibitors - reviewing new releases with an eye on which would sell the most tickets and advising on cinema management. Fan magazines came later, and they were aimed at the ticket-buying public, acknowledging they had a relationship with the actors on screen that lasted longer than an afternoon at the nickelodeon. 
In 1911, J Stuart Blackton, the head of Vitagraph Studios, established the first fan title, The Motion Picture Story Magazine, which combined short-story adaptations of popular films with advice on how to break into the film business and profiles of stars. With its name shortened to Motion Picture Magazine in 1914, it proved to be a hit, and was published monthly until 1977.
The king of all the fan magazines, though, was Photoplay, founded in the same year as Motion Picture. While Motion Picture initially had the edge over its rival, and the greater circulation in the early days, Photoplay reigned supreme in the 1920s and 1930s, with a canny mix of studio tie-ins and an "independent" editorial voice. While co-operation from the industry allowed Photoplay access to stars and sets, campaigning editorials claimed to speak for the fans. Like Motion Picture, it soon shifted its focus to the stars and their private lives. As the majority of film-goers were women, Photoplay addressed them directly with fashion and beauty hints, plus relationship advice. Beginning in 1920, the Photoplay Medal of Honor (a "solid gold" Tiffany medallion) was handed out every year to a film voted for by readers - one of the first major movie awards.
The "gossip" in Photoplay was discreet and mostly innocent: indeed, the magazine often did its best to dial down scandal. When Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks divorced their respective spouses and married each other in 1920, a double-page spread in Photoplay presented the couple's story as "filmdom's greatest real-life romance". It was the perfect sop to any delicate readers who were upset by the thought of divorce and the whiff of infidelity. Photoplay made it OK to carry on liking Mary and Doug, and buying tickets to their films. 
Photoplay positioned itself as an insider in the movie business, with privileged access to the stars, but still a fan at heart. It was expert at having its celebrity cake and eating it, too. Theda Bara offered the perfect test case. Photoplay readily admitted the truth the fans already knew, that she was really plain old Theodosia Goodman from Cincinnati, but they capitalised on the mystique just as much as her films did. In a 1918 issue, an interview cheekily titled "Does Theda Bara believe her own press agent?" allowed the actor to sidestep the crucial question of whether she was really wicked, or just photographed that way. In later years, Sidney Skolsky's "From a stool at Schwab's" gossip column was the birthplace of many a studio-planted Hollywood myth, and helped to make the drugstore it referenced a tourist destination.
The cover of each issue of Photoplay featured a painted portrait of a film star, and before the reader reached the articles, the first few pages were devoted to expensive studio photographs - the essence of Hollywood big-screen glamour, downsized into pinups for fans. Inside, photo spreads appeared to show the stars in private: relaxing with their famous friends or in snapshots of domestic bliss - think Joan Crawford hosting a dinner party.
On the pages of Photoplay, stars could appear to speak directly to their fans, either in "authored" pieces or in profiles and biographies. In the February 1922 edition, Gloria Swanson offered "The Confessions of a Modern Woman", for example, and in April 1924, vamp star Nita Naldi shared "What Men Have Told Me About Other Women - A Story That Every Wife Should Read". Photoplay's secret weapon was Adela Rogers St Johns, whose "sob sister" interviews with movie stars appeared to be so emotionally revealing as to create an entirely illusory sense of intimacy between reader and celebrity - although the "confessions" were mostly sanitised and scandal-free. Sexy sirens disclosed that all they wanted was a husband and family, screen lovers that they were just looking for the right girl. 
One exception was the extended interview that Clara Bow gave to St Johns in 1928, which the "mother confessor of Hollywood" decided to run as a first-person narrative. The idea of Bow telling her painful life story in her own words was meant to evoke sympathy for the Brooklyn-born flapper. But instead, readers and Hollywood colleagues alike were horrified by the revelations in the piece entitled "My Life". What really offended her peers was that while so many of them were trying to hide their pasts, Bow was prepared to put hers on display - and they didn't like this trend for honesty.
Another of St Johns' interviews had became controversial, when in a 1921 article titled "Love Confessions of a Fat Man", Roscoe Arbuckle joked: "It is very hard to murder or be murdered by a fat man." While that issue of Photoplay was on the newsstands, the actor Virginia Rappe died in a San Francisco hotel room where Arbuckle was hosting a party, and the quip took on a sinister tone. Arbuckle was charged with rape and manslaughter and endured three trials and the attendant publicity. Although he was eventually acquitted, the scandal reverberated through the industry, blackening Arbuckle's name. The comedian was ostracised by Hollywood and banned from working in the business.
Photoplay had another intervention to make, though, and this time deliberately. A 1925 editorial in Photoplay argued that Arbuckle should be let back into the fold ("My plea is for fair play") and encouraged readers to write to Will Hays at the Production Office if they agreed. They did, in their thousands. It was smart move from Photoplay's editor James R Quirk: minimising the disgrace attached to Arbuckle, and by association, Hollywood, while giving the appearance of standing in opposition to the studio machine, and shoulder-to-shoulder with the fans. 
Quirk was one of the founders of the magazine. He was the editor of Popular Mechanics when Photoplay was first launched, but took over the editorship in time for the January 1916 issue. He was a well-connected, well-liked man, known to some as "the father of the fans", with close friends in Hollywood and the world of publishing. His tactful, not to say corporate, editorship of Photoplay ensured that popularity, but his relationships with celebrities were often just as intimate as the magazine made out: he was a pallbearer at Rudolph Valentino's funeral, for example. He died in 1932, aged just 47, when Photoplay was at the height of its powers. The magazine's influence dissipated with the decline of the studio system in the 1950s, but Photoplay struggled on until 1980.
Today, although many of the names featured in Photoplay have become obscure, we can recognise the origins of our 24-hour celebrity culture in its pages. And for devotees of early Hollywood, much of the Photoplay archive, as well as that of its rivals, has been scanned and uploaded to a website called the Media History Project. Turning the pages click by click is a fascinating way to tour Hollywood in the silent era. And it's more than an excuse to wallow in old-fashioned glamour. Even the myths that the studios and stars want to tell about themselves reveal hidden truths, about what women in another time wished for, and the dreams Hollywood sold them with each ticket.

Unilever CEO Paul Polman - the optimistic pessimist; 
The CEO says his company has a duty to lead on key issues, be it corporate governance, long-term investment, the global economy or climate change.

Graham Ruddick.

"The world is in a more challenging situation than many people perhaps realise," Paul Polman explains. Depending on your point of view, the chief executive of Unilever, one of the biggest companies in the world, is either a gloomy pessimist or a unique figure in international business who believes his company has a duty to help the world tackle its big issues.
Being a pessimist certainly has its advantages as a chief executive. If you talk down the markets you operate in then no one expects much from you. If you also promote your own social conscience then it can help boost how customers view your company, particularly important for a business such as Unilever that produces everyday consumer brands from the washing powder Persil to Magnum, the ice-cream on a stick. 
Polman is a regular on the global summit circuit, visiting Davos for the World Economic Forum last week and Paris for the climate change summit in November. 
 Related:  Unilever says its 7,500 UK jobs will not suffer in case of Brexit
However, if you spend any time in his presence, it is clear the Dutchman's views are at the heart of how he runs Unilever. With a workforce of more than 170,000 and a market value of almost £90bn, he believes Unilever has a duty to lead on key topics.
"The global economy has many factors coming together at the same time that people probably struggle with, more than in previous times," he says.
"You have the geopolitical situation, we have a hard time getting economies growing in the US and Europe, and the emerging markets are clearly slowing down.
"So there is pressure all around the world on an economic growth basis. Then there are the geopolitical tensions that you are well aware of - and we have added Saudi Arabia and Iran to this now. And the issues of climate change are really showing up as well - this year's El NiÒo will probably be one of the more severe, we have just had the flooding [in Britain] and we have had significant flooding in Latin America."
Polman, who will turn 60 this year, believes it is important that businesses intervene in the challenges facing the world because it is not clear who will step in otherwise.
"Actually, that is one of the key issues in the world right now - the lack of global governance in a world that has become far more interdependent," he says.
"Some countries have played their role historically, but seem to be falling back to their home base; others have not been able to step up to the plate, claiming developing market status. But increasingly the issues that we are facing - climate change, unemployment, social cohesion, food security - these are issues of global proportions. We are often trapped in short-termism ... or other things. 
"Many of the institutions that were designed have served us very well, but they were designed in 1948 at the time of Bretton Woods [the conference held in 1944]. It is not surprising that you have now got an Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and other alternatives because the world has moved on."
Since Polman took charge of Unilever in January 2009 he has tried to back his words with actions. Unilever has stopped updating the stock market on its performance every quarter to encourage a long-term perspective, and it has launched a sustainable living plan that includes a commitment to cut calories in its ice-cream products. The company has pledged to eliminate coal from its energy usage within five years, and derive all of its energy solely from renewable sources by 2030. In Paris, Polman was part of a group of business leaders calling for a price on carbon.
However, is a business like Unilever really committed to long-term global issues such as climate change when it must also meet the demands of shareholders and pay out hundreds of millions of pounds in dividends each year? 
 Related:  Unilever boss warns UK against sugar tax
Polman insists that the dividend is part of "balancing the choices to multiple stakeholders" and that the financial markets are increasingly coming round to his way of thinking. 
"Businesses are also discovering that the costs of not doing things are becoming higher than doing things," he says. 
"The age of transparency should also not be underestimated. There are many people now that don't want to invest in companies that create a worse future for their grandchildren. They are able to see it by going to the internet and they vote increasingly with their wallet."
He adds that investors are aware of companies that behave responsibly and those that do not, noting that nearly half of Volkswagen's market capitalisation has been wiped out in the wake of the emissions scandal. 
Polman accepts that there are also still significant numbers of investors looking for the biggest possible short-term returns who do not care too much how companies achieve their dividends. But he is optimistic that a growing number are taking a longer-term view. 
"Companies in the US now spend more money on share buybacks or special dividends than they do reinvesting in their companies and protecting their futures. Many in the financial community are starting to be concerned about that," he says.
"We are fortunate in Unilever that we have about 70% of our shareholder base that has now been with us as long as I have been here. We have deliberately sought longer-term shareholders."
However, for all the long-term issues on Polman's mind, there are also short-term challenges that must be addressed, including the referendum on whether Britain should remain part of the European Union.
The Unilever boss is against Brexit, believing that the UK and the EU will be stronger together. However, Polman also believes that Europe needs reform if it wants to stay competitive.
"Europe is very occupied with itself in the short-term," he says. "The fundamental issues of how to make Europe more competitive, how to grow Europe for the longer term, are not being addressed. That is why you don't see any growth in Europe, there is still deflation in many markets. The real issues that started the euro crisis have not been addressed, either."
As for Unilever itself, Polman wants to continue to show that its personal and homecare products, food and refreshments can remain popular no matter what shape the economy is in.
Even though he is moving into his 60s and his tenure as chief executive is longer than average, Polman has no plans to retire: "I am 100% concentrated as if it is my first day. I still have that same energy."
"For us, it is very important that we can continue to show to everybody that in hell or high water, whatever the economic situation, we can continuously give competitive topline growth, improve our profitability, and do that in a responsible way. We can show that there is a different business model out there. We can hopefully start to address some of these major problems out there whilst at the same time satisfying the need of our shareholders."

World's largest palm oil trader criticised for lack of progress on deforestation; 
Wilmar claims it has made 'significant progress' but campaigners and experts say more is needed to prevent forest clearance or human rights abuses.

Tess Riley.

The world's largest palm oil processor and trader used the Davos gathering of business leaders as an opportunity to talk up progress on its efforts to tackle deforestation in the palm oil sector. 
Singapore-headquartered Wilmar says it has made "significant progress" on a commitment it made two years ago to eliminate deforestation, exploitation and peatland development from its supply chain. This includes publishing a list of crude palm oil mill sources that supply its refineries, enabling greater transparency along the company's supply chain.
However, campaigners and industry experts say the company is yet to prove that its suppliers are not responsible for clearing forests or abusing human rights. 
Glenn Hurowitz, senior fellow at the Centre for International Policy, who wrote an introductory commentary for Wilmar's progress report, told the Guardian that being able to measure progress is key: "Among the large agribusiness companies, Wilmar is leading the way in many areas, from supplier engagement to transparency to rapidly responding to grievances filed by civil society... But no company is providing comprehensive information about whether [its suppliers] are clearing forests or abusing human rights - the metrics that really matter." 
 Related:  From rainforest to your cupboard: the real story of palm oil - interactive
Even Wilmar's chief sustainability officer Jeremy Goon points out that "much remains to be done, including the development of a clear means to measure and track the progress of sustainability commitments to assess its effectiveness in reducing actual deforestation".
The key sticking point according to NGOs such as Greenpeace and the Forest Peoples Programme is that Wilmar, which controls 45% of global palm oil trade, cannot prove that its suppliers are not responsible for ongoing deforestation. The palm oil supply chain is notoriously complex and lacking in transparency, but Greenpeace Indonesia campaigner Annisa Rahmawati believes the company should be making better progress on its commitments.
"Wilmar promised that by the end of 2015 it would be able to show its palm oil suppliers were not destroying forests, developing on peatlands and were respecting human rights of communities and workers. This was the cornerstone of its policy, but now the company talks only of 'aspirations'. That is simply not good enough," says Rahmawati. 

Continued external pressure
Wilmar's 2013 commitment was a bold move but it didn't happen without considerable pressure from what environment author and journalist Fred Pearce describes as "strenuous NGO campaigns" and an announcement by Unilever - Wilmar's biggest customer and the world's largest purchaser of palm oil - that it would be tracking its entire supply chain to ensure it met its promise to end its role in deforestation. 
It's this same pressure that environmental non-profit CDP believes will help companies realise their no deforestation pledges. In its latest report CDP points out that suppliers and buyers of key agricultural forest-risk commodities, including palm oil and soy, are coming under growing pressure to ensure their supply chains do not destroy forests. "That pressure is building from their consumers and their investors," says CDP. In 2015, 298 investors with $19tn (£13.3tn) in assets under management requested that companies report data about forest risks through CDP, a 24% jump from the previous year.
 Related:  From the Nutella scandal to Indonesia's forest fires: palm oil in 2015 - in pictures
Hurowitz adds that Wilmar and other companies need to be absolutely clear to their suppliers that if they engage in deforestation or human rights abuses, they will lose access to global markets. "There's been altogether too much ambiguity about consequences, which has only encouraged some rogue actors to think they can deforest first and apologise later," he says.
So what will help end the ongoing land grab claims and forest fires that engulfed south-east Asia towards the end of last year? Hurowitz believes that governments must step up and take deforestation seriously, although this doesn't give companies carte blanche to carry on business as usual.
"For the sake of their own commercial interests, the leading companies need to do more to make clear to governments that effective law enforcement is essential if the palm oil industry is to restore its damaged reputation. To accelerate progress and prevent another haze crisis, companies should join with civil society to support government efforts to hold anyone who destroys forests and peatlands legally accountable."
Both Hurowitz and Rahmawati cite the example of the soy moratorium in Brazil, which brought companies, government and NGOs together to prevent deforestation of the Amazon. "By working together, traders like Wilmar were able to help eradicate forest destruction for soya in the Brazilian Amazon," says Rahmawati.

The station are selling T-shirts and encouraging donations on-air and online, and calling on those hosting Hottest 100 gatherings to take gold coin donations for the cause.
So that's nice. Also nice? Vallis Alps, a young duo (half Australian, half American) who put out their first EP last year - clocking up ten million plays before they'd played a live show - have debuted on the Hottest 100 at #27, and are probably losing their minds right now.

The person behind the campaign, Peter Drew, writes; 
"Help me stick up 1000 of these posters across Australia. The man in this poster is Monga Khan who lived and worked in Australia as a Cameleer. He was one of thousands of people who applied for exemptions to the White Australia Policy. 
Cameleers were granted exemptions because their work was essential to the Australian economy. For 70 years they played a crucial role... I'd like to celebrate their contribution to Australia."

 Kendrick Lamar  has entered the Hottest 100 poll with his track Alright, from his critically acclaimed third album To Pimp a Butterfly. 
This song, Triple J reminds us, has been an unofficial anthem of the #blacklivesmatter movement; the album it came from was described in the Guardian as "a visceral outpouring of this pain, which, in some cases, provided the language in which to fight back." 
This won't be the last we'll hear from Lamar today. He's a favourite for the top ten, according to both the bookies and the number crunchers ; meanwhile, university student Ed Pitt's project the Tepid 100, which compiled the 2,064 ballots that were shared on Instagram from the moment voting began on January 7, predicts King Kunta will win. 
 If it does, Lamar will be the first black American to hit the top spot. 
In a surprise twist for those who get surprised by this kind of thing, Florence + the Machine's big song of 2015, Ship to Wreck, featured a few spots lower than Delilah; Delilah also beat out Florence's two-time Grammy-nominated track What Kind of Man, which came in at #70.

Hello from Melbourne, Melissa Davey with you here.
I'll start with news from an important Australian sporting contest.
From AAP: 
What do Crawline Hanson, Ita Buttroach and Alfred Hitcocky have in common? They have all enjoyed celebrity status on Australia Day by crawling into the hall of fame for one of Brisbane's most dinky di institutions. The Story Bridge Hotel cockroach races celebrated 35 years on Tuesday and Don't Blush Baby was the first across the line in a win far less controversial than cricket star Chris Gayle's post-match interview. Maybe that's because the cocky's buyer, Irishman Mark Alcorn, had warned him to be wary of the girls. "I said, look you know, don't be distracted with all the bar girls, all the draught... it's a big occasion for you but you just stay focused, stick to the plan, you got this," Mr Alcorn said after the win. It was the first of 14 races at the Kangaroo Point establishment, which had thousands of Aussie Day revellers visit throughout the afternoon.

 - ABC News Brisbane (@ABCNewsBrisbane) January 26, 2016
Cockroach MC Damian Burke said the event had grown in popularity since originating as a way to settle some river rivalry many years ago. "It started in 1982 when someone in Bulimba thought the cockroaches there were faster than the ones at Kangaroo Point," he told AAP. "So we thought we have to have a race to sort this out. Kangaroo Point was the clear winner." At the start of each race, a container full of marked cockroaches are spilled onto a mat with the first to crawl out of the circle declared the winner. Patrons can buy a cocky to enter into the races, with some 560 of the crawlies kept in containers at the back of the stewards' tent. They are sourced from a university laboratory, and while some are recaptured, where the rest end up is anyone's guess. But it's all for a good cause. "As the years have gone by we've raised over $500,000 for charities," Mr Burke said.

"When we were making the album it was one of the last songs I came up with and kinda wrote the lyrics really quickly on the floor," she told Triple J, with that same lackadaisical air for which she's known. 
"But it all kinda came together."
It's been a big year for Barnett, whose debut album won the J Award and wound up on best-of lists the world over; she was nominated for a Grammy, toured the world, and made an appearance on Ellen too. 
"I tend to look at the smaller picture a bit more," she told Guardian Australia this month.

Western Australia's Colin Barnett, the only Australian premier or chief minister not to sign a letter calling for a republic, reckons we should wait another 10 years.
Barnett refused to sign because he didn't want to suggest his views reflected the views of Western Australians and the declaration was like a petition, AAP reports.
"I didn't think it was appropriate as a premier of Western Australia to take my own views and then suggest that represents Western Australia," he told reporters at an Australia Day event on Tuesday.
Mr Barnett brushed off the suggestion that his decision had anything to do with the opening of Elizabeth Quay later this week.
"We had a referendum, I supported the republic publicly during that period, but the Australian people voted and they voted against that, so I respect their decision and I don't think we should rush back into that debate," he said. 
A reasonable passage of time would be 25 years, so the debate should happen again in about 10 years, the premier said. 
"I've got no doubt Australia will become a republic." 
Mr Barnett said the Australian flag was a separate issue but he supported the current flag.

Who's in the mood for a Hottest 100 controversy? It's been at least five minutes since the last, I'm sure. 
This one comes courtesy of Twitter via the Daily Mail, and features Australian musician Chet Faker who had three songs in last year's top 10, including the number one.
Erin Riley tweeted yesterday, making (imho) a valid point about diversity in the Hottest 100 in a pretty entertaining way.

Unfortunately I can't offer you croc related Australia Day activities (an egregious oversight by the NT government and local publicans), but I can give you the next best thing - cockroach races! 
Apparently in Brisbane cockroaches are favoured a little more than they are in Sydney's infested suburbs. 
Owner of the Story Bridge Hotel Richard Deery told the ABC the event - now in its 35th year - was typically Australian.
"It lets everyone become an owner, from the youngest to the oldest. They can all be an owner of a thoroughbred," he said.

The title of Tame Impala 's first song in this year's Hottest 100, 'Cause I'm A Man, at #61, works as the perfect segue for a quick post about gender. 
By our count, of the first 40 songs featured in the 2016 poll, 17 feature female vocalists. According to Triple J commentator Patrick Avenell, the record of female vocals featured in the Hottest 100 is 26, so we're more than halfway there (although it's important to remember that when a woman's vocal features on a track, it doesn't necessarily mean she's getting paid for it ).
According to an in-depth piece published by BuzzFeed today, the record of women featuring in the Hottest 100 as vocalists or band members is 34, in 2012. Only three bands featuring female artists have won the Hottest 100 ( The Cranberries, Angus & Julia Stone and Spiderbait ), but no solo female artist has ever won.

It wouldn't be Australia Day without a Hemsworth, so here's Chris (that would be Thor, not Hunger Games Hemsworth or the other one) who last week was named global ambassador for Tourism Australia.
The fruits of that union, a three-minute ad with Hemsworthian narration, was launched at an Australia Day do in New York. But Chris Hemsworth 's actual face is not in it because, according to Tourism Australia managing director John O'Sullivan, he's just too gosh-darn handsome and would be a distraction.
I may be paraphrasing a bit. Here's O'Sullivan, from News.com.au :
There's Nothing Like Australia has always been very much about Australia being the hero and telling the country's story.
We felt Chris and his voiceover would provide the perfect complement - an authentic and influential voice to help tell the story.
Hemsworth, who moved to Byron Bay, said he was proud to take on the role:
It's a pretty special feeling knowing that I will have a role in promoting my country to the world and encouraging more people to come down under and experience our amazing beaches and landscapes for themselves.

To Western Australia now, where the first Syrian family settled in Australia after the former prime minister, Tony Abbott, announced in September that Australia would accept 12,000 refugees has apparently enjoyed a barbecue.
The family of five arrived in Perth in November.
According to AAP, Bashar Kujah, his wife Khawlah, and children Mohammad, 8, Maryam, 7, Ahmad, 3, and newborn Abdullah, whose impending birth caused authorities to settle the family earlier than the original arrival date of just after Christmas, attended a community barbecue in Bayswater.
They spoke to reporters through an interpreter. This is from AAP:
They're very happy and they feel that they've come to a great country and they feel among family and friends here." 
Kujah hoped other relatives would eventually be able to come to Australia.
His wife thanked everyone who helped them settle into their Yokine home and said she was so happy her youngest child was born in Australia.
"She's very happy, very pleased that he was born here in Australia so he's now officially an Australian citizen," the interpreter said.
"She's just absolutely thrilled that he had a chance to be born here."

Afternoon all. I'm picking up our live coverage of Australia Day/Survival Day for now. 
Let's start with a very Australian occurrence: Neil Mitchell is angry. Specifically, he is angry about the proliferation of graffiti and signs in the Melbourne CBD declaring today Invasion Day and saying Australia is "celebrating 228 years of genocide".
The talkback radio host objected, saying: "It's nonsense and it's offensive."
You can read more about his objections here, although he doesn't really expand the point.
I've just come from Melbourne's Invasion Day march and while it would have been difficult to hear much objection over the sound of thousands of people chanting "Always was, always will be Aboriginal land," no one much seemed offended.

 Summary  
I'm about to hand over our continuing coverage of Australia Day to my colleague Calla Wahlquist. Here's a short summary of how the day is unfolding so far:

Invasion Day protests are taking place across the nation to rally for Indigenous recognition, land rights and equal rights across a range of areas. Major rallies are taking place in Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide.

Former chief of army David Morrison was named Australian of the Year late on Monday evening for his role in the promotion of gender equality in the armed forces.

Prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said the push for a republic is doomed unless it is spurred on by the public.

Eminent women in engineering, philanthropy and sport are among those who have been recognised in the Australia Day honours. Former sex discrimination commissioner Elizabeth Broderick was admitted as an officer of the Order of Australia.

My colleague Calla Wahlquist has been on the ground in Melbourne at the Invasion Day parade. Here's a short dispatch:
Faced with a wall of protesters, the police turned aside. Several hundred people were marching down Melbourne's Bourke Street mall in the name of Invasion Day, and they had reached the barricades set up for the official Australia Day parade. 
The march, which began at Parliament House in Spring Street, now stretched back almost two city blocks. The police line inched back, then stood aside. For the third time in 12 months a protest about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander rights stopped traffic in the Melbourne CBD. Crowds wearing Australian flag tattoos remained on the barricades to watch the new parade go by, to the chant of: "Always was, always will be Aboriginal land." 
Flowers for a memorial were left on the steps of Parliament House and the chant turned to "no pride in genocide". One marcher, who took part in previous Invasion Day marches, said the crowd was twice that of last year. Not everyone was supportive. 
A lone angry white man, resolutely standing at a barricade as the rest of the fence was dismantled around him, punctuated every cry of "Always was, always will be" with "Crap! It's all bullshit, everyone came from somewhere." A slew of police officers sidled up and stood within grabbing distance as the crowd treated him to his own personal chant.
On the other side of the barrier, among a thicket of protest signs, a white man who looked to be in his 90s took a selfie with a young Aboriginal woman." Here," she said, wrapping an Aboriginal flag around his green-and-gold get-up. "Let's cover that up. So will you be marching with us from now on? It's better on this side," she asked. Yes, he agreed. It was.

This would have been a rather grisly discovery for some picnickers in Melbourne. AAP filed this report a short time ago:
A kangaroo has been decapitated and its head left on a barbecue plate at a popular picnic area in Melbourne.
Police say the kangaroo and a skinned rabbit were found at the Diamond creek walking trail picnic site about 8.20am on Tuesday, Australia Day.
When police arrived, they found the head of the kangaroo on a barbecue plate. The body was about 60 metres away, a Victoria police spokeswoman, Leading Sen Const Lee Thomson said.
A witness, Michael, told 3AW he was jogging when he came upon the terrible sight.
"I was just at the jogging track and there's about 10 police here. Kids have put the kangaroo on a public barbecue and have turned it on," he said.
"There's a lot of families here. Police have covered it up in plastic because there's a lot of kids around."
Police are asking anyone with information to come forward.

Potentially the biggest Australia Day event in Darwin, the Ute Run attracts hundreds of decked-out vehicles to cruise the streets. A large number of spectators line the streets in camp chairs, ute trays, on picnic rugs, waving as the convoy drives past. It's been run for 14 years and raises money for Variety NT. 
It's hot and sweaty on the race track and there are more stubbie shorts and singlets than you could poke a mullet at.
Most are decorated in Australian flags but others have made more of an effort.
The owner of the Camel car, Jimmy Doyle, says it's done six Variety bashes and raised about $130,000. Underneath the fur is a 1985 ZL Fairlane, which "hasn't missed a beat, hasn't even had a flat tyre" on the long journeys.
"You haven't lived till you've been on a Variety Bash, and the week after you don't want to live until your liver sorts itself out," he tells Guardian Australia.
Doyle is also a Variety NT board member and chair of the grants committee. "I get to give the money away which is probably the best second job in the cosmos."

In Queensland there's also quite an extensive rally being held by activists and protesters in support of Indigenous land rights. AAP reports:
A large crowd of Aboriginal activists and supporters has rallied outside Queensland's Parliament House in a protest against Invasion Day.
The crowd gathered outside the entrance of state parliament to express opposition to the celebration of the national day on 26 January, and hear speeches on forced removal of children, racial discrimination and the destruction of traditional lands.
"Always was, always will be, Aboriginal land," they chanted, ahead of a march through the Brisbane CBD en route to Musgrave park.

In the world of sport my colleague Mike Hytner has asked me to remind readers that Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova have just started their Australian Open quarter-final. You can read our live coverage of all things sporting today on this live blog.
Paul Connolly has also written a longer piece on the Australian sporting honours list:
Such are the accomplishments of Australia's best ever male tennis player that if there's any surprise at Rod Laver being appointed a Companion (AC) of the Order of Australia it's that he hadn't already received the honour.
Made a Member of the British Empire in 1970 - a year after he won all four grand slam tournaments in the same calendar year for the second time - Laver, 77, was one of just 10 recipients of the top honour, recognised for his "eminent service to tennis as a player, representative and mentor, at the national and international level, and as a role model for young sportsmen and women".
Born in Rockhampton, Queensland, the left-handed Laver, nicknamed "Rocket", won 11 grand slam singles titles - and contributed to six doubles titles, three mixed doubles titles and five Davis Cup titles - despite being banned from amateur tennis, including grand slam events, between 1963 and 1968 for turning professional. When professionalism was embraced in 1968, Laver added five grand slam singles titles to the six he won before 1963.

In Sydney the Invasion Day march has arrived at Australia House. The march picked up quite impressively as it wound through the city, and there are a lot of great images that have been popping up.

There's also been considerable disquiet about the extent that police are filming the rally. It's now become an increasingly common practice for NSW police to film rallies and protests. In some cases the footage has been subsequently used as evidence in prosecutions, often for offensive language or behaviour when protests become more heated.

The Hottest 100 countdown began with an acknowledgement of country, the first time that's been done in any Triple J broadcast in memory:
As part of our commitment to reconciliation and equality, we believe January 26 should be inclusive, meaningful and respectful to all Australians, so we take this moment to commemorate Australia's First Peoples.
Triple J acknowledges the traditional owners of country throughout Australia and recognises their continuing connection to land, waters and community. We pay our respects to them and their cultures, and to elders both past and present.

Members of the Ahmadi movement of Islam are popping up at Australia Day ceremonies around the country, handing out pamphlets that read "Muslims for loyalty", and carrying out their own flag-hoisting ceremonies at mosques in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide.
enltrThis is Ahmadiyya Muslim Association Australia member Noor Islam. He's handing out #MuslimsForLoyalty pamphlets. pic.twitter.com/2ARniuFj8Y

By way of context, the Ahmadiyya are neither Sunni nor Shia, and in fact are considered heretical by some orthodox Muslims. The movement sprang up around 1889 in what was then British-controlled India, its leader Mirza Ghulam Ahmad proclaiming himself a divine reformer and prophet. That claim is rejected by most Muslims, who consider Muhammad the last prophet, and Ahmadis have faced persecution, both legal and by vigilantes, in places such as Pakistan, Indonesia and Iran.

They have faced no such trouble in Australia where the 3,000-strong community is thriving and has made itself a fixture at events such as Clean Up Australia Day. Ahmadis were also prominent in the aftermath of the 2014 Sydney siege, when they descended on Martin Place in "Muslims for Peace" shirts. 
(Incidentally, the siege gunman, Man Haron Monis, told Australian immigration authorities he had become an Ahmadiyya Muslim in Iran, and consequently feared for his life. He received a refugee visa after making the claim - investigators say it was almost certainly a lie.)

 Malcolm Turnbull: no politician can make Australia a republic  
Malcolm Turnbull says the next push for a republic in Australia must come from a grassroots movement rather than be driven by politicians, or the campaign will end in another "heroic defeat".
The prime minister, an avowed republican, was speaking after hosting an Australia Day citizenship ceremony in Canberra.
The Australian Republican Movement has sought to build momentum by publishing a pro-republic open letter from all premiers and chief ministers (except Western Australia's Colin Barnett). The new Australian of the Year, David Morrison, has also pledged support for constitutional change.
Turnbull said he welcomed the additional voices of support, but said the push for a republic must be shown to be a genuinely popular movement.
"No politician, no prime minister or opposition leader or premier can make Australia a republic. Only the Australian people can do that through a referendum.
There needs to be very strong popular momentum for a change. There has to be a sense that the time is right. There are many more urgent issues confronting Australia, and indeed confronting the government, than the momentum or the desire for Australia to become a republic.
Turnbull said the next referendum should held after the end of the Queen's reign to have the best chance of succeeding.
"To get momentum... it needs to have grassroots support. It is not something that a government can just do, even if it wanted to."

 3, 2, 1... the Hottest 100 gets under way  
Triple J's annual Hottest 100 countdown - for many fans of Powderfinger and Muse, a highlight of the national day - is getting under way across Australia.
In typical millennial fashion (I'm assuming, in typical millennial fashion), plenty of people left it until the last minute to cast their votes, with Triple J reporting a "huge swell of traffic" to its website on Friday before the competition closed.
 Related:  Triple J calls out bookies for betting bonuses on Hottest 100
More than 2m votes were cast by nearly 300,000 voters from 172 countries. "That's HEAPS," said Triple J in a press release, "after spending the weekend crunching numbers."
Here are some of the findings of its stats-a-thon:

2,094,350 votes cast by 298,851 voters from 172 countries
More than 16,000 songs voted for
54% of the songs in the Hottest 100 from Australian artists
26 Hottest 100 debutantes
Average beats per minute 123, compared with 121 in 2014 and 116 in 2013
Triple J also congratulated listeners on the "number of successful troll campaigns... [and] songs disqualified" ("zero") this year, a definitely-not-bitter reference to the #Tay4Hottest100 unpleasantness that marred 2015's competition.
(There were actually tentative moves to get Justin Bieber recognised in the countdown, the legalities of which were discussed at length in this pun- and quotation mark-heavy blog post.)
There are several ways to follow the countdown:
You can turn on your radio, tune into 'Triple J' on your digital radio, stream via the  Triple J website or listen through the Triple J iPhone app  and the  ABC radio Android app. Plus you can  follow us on social media as we update the Hottest 100  songs, give you a look behind the scenes and highlight the best Hottest 100 parties throughout the day on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Spotify and you can find us on Snapchat at triplejsnaps.

"When everyone gets a chance to reach their potential, we as a society can reach our potential," he said in an interview with ABC 24. 
   Australian of the Year David Morrison intends to push for a 'fair go' for everyone.

The electronic music duo of Julian Hamilton and Kim Moyes have proposed shifting the national holiday to an alternate date, such as the birthday of either writer Henry Lawson or Indigenous activist Eddie Mabo.
But not everyone who's engaged with the post has been supportive.
"How dare you insult a day that is about everyone and turn it into a political discussion which has a typical agenda pushed not by indigenous people, but by white do-gooders," said Nathan Sorensen-Salman.

Thus far Australia Day has been marked with plenty of public speeches and pockets of protest. As Michael Safi  has already reported, the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has acknowledged contention over the day in recognising "the oldest continuing cultures on Earth".
"They are the first Australians and we respect and honour them on this, our national day," he said.
As my colleague Monica Tan  wrote in her wrap of Indigenous events being held nationwide, today is for many a timely opportunity to protest against the impacts of colonialism and to express pride in Indigenous culture.

The original hall has been purchased as part of a five-year campaign, and it will be the first time in 78 years that Indigenous Australians have gathered there on 26 January.

The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has just spoken in Canberra. Here's a bit of what he had to say:
Australia is the most successful multicultural society in the world, diverse and harmonious. Our people come from close to 200 countries. For more than 40,000 years, Australia was cared for by the nation's of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Theirs are the oldest continuing cultures on eart h. They are the first Australians and we respect and honour them on this, our national day. So our nation is as old as humanity itself, as old as the rock carvings of the peninsula and the stories of the Dreamtime, told by the first Australians, as old as the Magna Carta, the rule of law and the poetry of Shakespeare, brought by the British settlers, as old as the mysteries of every faith and the riches of every culture, which contributes so much to our diversity.  
Yet, we are as new as the baby who becomes a citizen today in the arms of its migrant parents. We can look at our past with great pride and with some regret but we are not defined, let alone trapped by our history, as many other nations are. Many nations define themselves by a common race or religion or culture. Not us. Our national identity is defined by shared political values, democracy, tempered by the rule of law. A deep belief that each of us owes the other a fair go, the best chance to realise our dreams. And binding us together is mutual respect. We often take that forgranted but we should not. We don't have to look far to seethe consequences of its absence. 
From here he launches into the full Turnbull:
We live in the most exciting time in human history. There has never been such rapid change. Billions lifted out of poverty in a few generations, technology available to many that until recently, even the richest billionaire could not afford. And in this era of transformation, Australia is so well positioned. In a global economy where technology is triumphing over geography, Australians are naturally global citizens.

Not a bad view, via Jessica Mauboy, who sang the national anthem this morning from the top of the Sydney Harbour bridge. 
Here's AAP's take:
Dressed in a bright red dress, Mauboy belted out the national anthem in the Indigenous language before repeating it in English from the blustery heights of the Sydney Harbour Bridge.
Both the Australian and Aboriginal flags were raised together as she sang the anthems at 134 metres above the harbour.
Mauboy's heartfelt delivery sounded out across the harbour just before 8am on a cloudy Tuesday morning.
The Indigenous version was a medley of local Sydney dialects, Australia Day organisers said.

Many Australia Day barbecues around the country will see patchy weather with clouds threatening to make backyard cricket a bit muddy.
For Sydneysiders, the Bureau of Meteorology is forecasting a cloudy day with a maximum of 27C. But more likely than not, there will be a shower or two.
 Melburnians will probably escape any rain ruining their snags, with a sunny day reaching a max of 28C. Although the smell of their barbecues will mingle with the smell of smoke from bushfires.  
 Brisbane will reach similar temperatures but most likley have showers and thunderstorms, while Perth and Adelaide look set to be sunny and reach the low 30s.

An unexpected hit on the eve of Australia Day has been the months-old, but only recently posted video of journalist Stan Grant 's remarks during an IQ2 debate in Sydney, on whether racism was ruining the Australian dream.
Emphatically yes, said Grant, also Guardian Australia's Indigenous Affairs editor.
   Stan Grant at the IQ2 Racism debate  
If you're one of the handful of people left in the country who hasn't seen it, you bloody should. 
Stan has written on the video's success and reflected on the meaning of Australia Day in his latest piece here.
Australia's myths, poetry and anthem tell of a land that can appear unrecognisable to us. We don't share in the 'boundless plains', we have not enjoyed the 'wealth for toil', the sweeping plains and rugged mountains ranges of a sunburnt country were too often places of death for us on the Australian frontier.
Indigenous people die still a decade younger than our fellow Australians, we are 3% of the population yet a quarter of those in prisons. By every measure Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders remain the poorest, most disadvantaged people in Australia and this is no accident. The seeds of our suffering were sown in dispossession at a time when the very humanity of my people was denied.

The Australian of the Year, David Morrison, has also had a speech go viral. Here's his famed June 2013 address - penned by another Australian of the Year nominee, Group Captain Cate McGregor - making it eminently clear what he expects of his troops ("... and if that does not suit you, then get out"). 
Awarded Australian of the Year on Monday night, Morrison said of his remarks: "It's only a fellow, a bloke, saying to his workforce that treating your colleagues with respect is a precondition of your employment. That's all it is."

Our friends over at New Matilda note that past 'straya day-themed Doodles have played a straight bat: kids building a sandcastle, idyllic bush scenes, native wildlife. Something is stirring.
Or is it? We've also been passed a poll by YouGov, of more than 500 people, surveying their views on Australia/Invasion/Survival Day. It found:

86% of Australians refer to 26 January as Australia Day. A particularly crusty minority opt for Anniversary/Foundation/ANA Day (6%). The last 8% "have no opinion on what the day is known as".
78% of Australians polled said the day was worth celebrating: to take pride in Australia's culture, values, identity (74%), to hold citizenship ceremonies and other events (60%) and celebrate the patchwork of communities that make up the social fabric (56%).
Around 67 of the 538 people polled said the day wasn't worth celebrating. 65% said it represented loss and injustice towards Indigenous Australians, 35% said it was a lame excuse to get pissed and one-quarter said it lacked any real meaning.

Good morning, it's Australia Day 2016, and we're covering it live all day. Welcome to our coverage.
Much of the chatter this year is about change: the date of our national day, the constitution and the flag - the latter to one of these numbers, put to a vote of more than 8,000 run by a Western Sydney University researcher.
    From left to right, top to bottom: Reconciliation, Sporting, Southern Horizon, Golden Wattle and Southern Cross and Eureka flags. The flags are part of a survey being conducted by Western Sydney University researcher Dr Benjamin T Jones to find out Australian's attitudes to their flag and how they would feel if it was changed. Photograph: Western Sydney University   
More than 60% said they were in favour of switching out the flag, with the most popular design, Southern Horizon in the top right, winning 31% of the vote. 
Already we know the Australian of the Year: Lieutenant General David Morrison, the former chief of army for the Australian defence force and a campaigner for diversity and equality in the armed forces. 
A potential future winner is Senator Jacqui Lambie, who's had a strong start, delivering an Australia Day message urging anyone who doesn't like our "democratic rights" to find another country.
Naturally, she's in a sequinned Australian flag singlet and feather hat plastered in the national ensign. Here's the highlight of her address, which I hope will be an annual fixture:
Remember, if you don't like our democratic rights, liberties and laws, equality for all, including women, gay, and Indigenous people, there are plenty of other countries to choose from.
We'll bring you highlights from events around the country, including updates on the all-important Triple J Hottest 100, and whatever else springs up on this auspicious occasion. 
Much about today is contested, and feels especially so this year. One thing worth celebrating: that it's still possible, at least for one day, for Australians who disagree to sit down together, honour what makes this country special, and write no columns whatsoever.

Hello from Melbourne, Melissa Davey with you here.
I'll start with news from an important Australian sporting contest. 
From AAP: 
What do Crawline Hanson, Ita Buttroach and Alfred Hitcocky have in common? They have all enjoyed celebrity status on Australia Day by crawling into the hall of fame for one of Brisbane's most dinky di institutions. The Story Bridge Hotel cockroach races celebrated 35 years on Tuesday and Don't Blush Baby was the first across the line in a win far less controversial than cricket star Chris Gayle's post-match interview. Maybe that's because the cocky's buyer, Irishman Mark Alcorn, had warned him to be wary of the girls. "I said, look you know, don't be distracted with all the bar girls, all the draught... it's a big occasion for you but you just stay focused, stick to the plan, you got this," Mr Alcorn said after the win. It was the first of 14 races at the Kangaroo Point establishment, which had thousands of Aussie Day revellers visit throughout the afternoon.

 - ABC News Brisbane (@ABCNewsBrisbane) January 26, 2016
Cockroach MC Damian Burke said the event had grown in popularity since originating as a way to settle some river rivalry many years ago. "It started in 1982 when someone in Bulimba thought the cockroaches there were faster than the ones at Kangaroo Point," he told AAP. "So we thought we have to have a race to sort this out. Kangaroo Point was the clear winner." At the start of each race, a container full of marked cockroaches are spilled onto a mat with the first to crawl out of the circle declared the winner. Patrons can buy a cocky to enter into the races, with some 560 of the crawlies kept in containers at the back of the stewards' tent. They are sourced from a university laboratory, and while some are recaptured, where the rest end up is anyone's guess. But it's all for a good cause. "As the years have gone by we've raised over $500,000 for charities," Mr Burke said.

Bring Me The Horizon have made their third showing in the Hottest 100, as Courtney Barnett's fourth song, Pedestrian At Best - her best bet for the top twenty - enters the poll, lower than most of her fans were hoping for. Still, four songs out of a hundred is not a bad effort.

"When we were making the album it was one of the last songs I came up with and kinda wrote the lyrics really quickly on the floor," she told Triple J, with that same lackadaisical air for which she's known. 
"But it all kinda came together."
It's been a big year for Barnett, whose debut album won the J Award and wound up on best-of lists the world over; she was nominated for a Grammy, toured the world, and made an appearance on Ellen too. 
"I tend to look at the smaller picture a bit more," she told Guardian Australia this month.

Western Australia's Colin Barnett, the only Australian premier or chief minister not to sign a letter calling for a republic, reckons we should wait another 10 years.
Barnett refused to sign because he didn't want to suggest his views reflected the views of Western Australians and the declaration was like a petition, AAP reports.
"I didn't think it was appropriate as a premier of Western Australia to take my own views and then suggest that represents Western Australia," he told reporters at an Australia Day event on Tuesday.
Mr Barnett brushed off the suggestion that his decision had anything to do with the opening of Elizabeth Quay later this week.
"We had a referendum, I supported the republic publicly during that period, but the Australian people voted and they voted against that, so I respect their decision and I don't think we should rush back into that debate," he said. 
A reasonable passage of time would be 25 years, so the debate should happen again in about 10 years, the premier said. 
"I've got no doubt Australia will become a republic." 
Mr Barnett said the Australian flag was a separate issue but he supported the current flag.

Who's in the mood for a Hottest 100 controversy? It's been at least five minutes since the last, I'm sure. 
This one comes courtesy of Twitter via the Daily Mail, and features Australian musician Chet Faker who had three songs in last year's top 10, including the number one.
Erin Riley tweeted yesterday, making (imho) a valid point about diversity in the Hottest 100 in a pretty entertaining way.

Unfortunately I can't offer you croc related Australia Day activities (an egregious oversight by the NT government and local publicans), but I can give you the next best thing - cockroach races! 
Apparently in Brisbane cockroaches are favoured a little more than they are in Sydney's infested suburbs. 
Owner of the Story Bridge Hotel Richard Deery told the ABC the event - now in its 35th year - was typically Australian.
"It lets everyone become an owner, from the youngest to the oldest. They can all be an owner of a thoroughbred," he said.

The title of Tame Impala 's first song in this year's Hottest 100, 'Cause I'm A Man, at #61, works as the perfect segue for a quick post about gender. 
By our count, of the first 40 songs featured in the 2016 poll, 17 feature female vocalists. According to Triple J commentator Patrick Avenell, the record of female vocals featured in the Hottest 100 is 26, so we're more than halfway there (although it's important to remember that when a woman's vocal features on a track, it doesn't necessarily mean she's getting paid for it ).
According to an in-depth piece published by BuzzFeed today, the record of women featuring in the Hottest 100 as vocalists or band members is 34, in 2012. Only three bands featuring female artists have won the Hottest 100 ( The Cranberries, Angus & Julia Stone and Spiderbait ), but no solo female artist has ever won.

It wouldn't be Australia Day without a Hemsworth, so here's Chris (that would be Thor, not Hunger Games Hemsworth or the other one) who last week was named global ambassador for Tourism Australia.
The fruits of that union, a three-minute ad with Hemsworthian narration, was launched at an Australia Day do in New York. But Chris Hemsworth 's actual face is not in it because, according to Tourism Australia managing director John O'Sullivan, he's just too gosh-darn handsome and would be a distraction.
I may be paraphrasing a bit. Here's O'Sullivan, from News.com.au :
There's Nothing Like Australia has always been very much about Australia being the hero and telling the country's story.
We felt Chris and his voiceover would provide the perfect complement - an authentic and influential voice to help tell the story.
Hemsworth, who moved to Byron Bay, said he was proud to take on the role:
It's a pretty special feeling knowing that I will have a role in promoting my country to the world and encouraging more people to come down under and experience our amazing beaches and landscapes for themselves.

To Western Australia now, where the first Syrian family settled in Australia after the former prime minister, Tony Abbott, announced in September that Australia would accept 12,000 refugees has apparently enjoyed a barbecue.
The family of five arrived in Perth in November.
According to AAP, Bashar Kujah, his wife Khawlah, and children Mohammad, 8, Maryam, 7, Ahmad, 3, and newborn Abdullah, whose impending birth caused authorities to settle the family earlier than the original arrival date of just after Christmas, attended a community barbecue in Bayswater.
They spoke to reporters through an interpreter. This is from AAP:
They're very happy and they feel that they've come to a great country and they feel among family and friends here." 
Kujah hoped other relatives would eventually be able to come to Australia.
His wife thanked everyone who helped them settle into their Yokine home and said she was so happy her youngest child was born in Australia.
"She's very happy, very pleased that he was born here in Australia so he's now officially an Australian citizen," the interpreter said.
"She's just absolutely thrilled that he had a chance to be born here."

Afternoon all. I'm picking up our live coverage of Australia Day/Survival Day for now. 
Let's start with a very Australian occurrence: Neil Mitchell is angry. Specifically, he is angry about the proliferation of graffiti and signs in the Melbourne CBD declaring today Invasion Day and saying Australia is "celebrating 228 years of genocide".
The talkback radio host objected, saying: "It's nonsense and it's offensive."
You can read more about his objections here, although he doesn't really expand the point.
I've just come from Melbourne's Invasion Day march and while it would have been difficult to hear much objection over the sound of thousands of people chanting "Always was, always will be Aboriginal land," no one much seemed offended.

 Summary  
I'm about to hand over our continuing coverage of Australia Day to my colleague Calla Wahlquist. Here's a short summary of how the day is unfolding so far:

Invasion Day protests are taking place across the nation to rally for Indigenous recognition, land rights and equal rights across a range of areas. Major rallies are taking place in Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide.

Former chief of army David Morrison was named Australian of the Year late on Monday evening for his role in the promotion of gender equality in the armed forces.

Prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said the push for a republic is doomed unless it is spurred on by the public.

Eminent women in engineering, philanthropy and sport are among those who have been recognised in the Australia Day honours. Former sex discrimination commissioner Elizabeth Broderick was admitted as an officer of the Order of Australia.

My colleague Calla Wahlquist has been on the ground in Melbourne at the Invasion Day parade. Here's a short dispatch:
Faced with a wall of protesters, the police turned aside. Several hundred people were marching down Melbourne's Bourke Street mall in the name of Invasion Day, and they had reached the barricades set up for the official Australia Day parade. 
The march, which began at Parliament House in Spring Street, now stretched back almost two city blocks. The police line inched back, then stood aside. For the third time in 12 months a protest about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander rights stopped traffic in the Melbourne CBD. Crowds wearing Australian flag tattoos remained on the barricades to watch the new parade go by, to the chant of: "Always was, always will be Aboriginal land." 
Flowers for a memorial were left on the steps of Parliament House and the chant turned to "no pride in genocide". One marcher, who took part in previous Invasion Day marches, said the crowd was twice that of last year. Not everyone was supportive. 
A lone angry white man, resolutely standing at a barricade as the rest of the fence was dismantled around him, punctuated every cry of "Always was, always will be" with "Crap! It's all bullshit, everyone came from somewhere." A slew of police officers sidled up and stood within grabbing distance as the crowd treated him to his own personal chant.
On the other side of the barrier, among a thicket of protest signs, a white man who looked to be in his 90s took a selfie with a young Aboriginal woman." Here," she said, wrapping an Aboriginal flag around his green-and-gold get-up. "Let's cover that up. So will you be marching with us from now on? It's better on this side," she asked. Yes, he agreed. It was.

This would have been a rather grisly discovery for some picnickers in Melbourne. AAP filed this report a short time ago:
A kangaroo has been decapitated and its head left on a barbecue plate at a popular picnic area in Melbourne.
Police say the kangaroo and a skinned rabbit were found at the Diamond creek walking trail picnic site about 8.20am on Tuesday, Australia Day.
When police arrived, they found the head of the kangaroo on a barbecue plate. The body was about 60 metres away, a Victoria police spokeswoman, Leading Sen Const Lee Thomson said.
A witness, Michael, told 3AW he was jogging when he came upon the terrible sight.
"I was just at the jogging track and there's about 10 police here. Kids have put the kangaroo on a public barbecue and have turned it on," he said.
"There's a lot of families here. Police have covered it up in plastic because there's a lot of kids around."
Police are asking anyone with information to come forward.

Potentially the biggest Australia Day event in Darwin, the Ute Run attracts hundreds of decked-out vehicles to cruise the streets. A large number of spectators line the streets in camp chairs, ute trays, on picnic rugs, waving as the convoy drives past. It's been run for 14 years and raises money for Variety NT. 
It's hot and sweaty on the race track and there are more stubbie shorts and singlets than you could poke a mullet at.
Most are decorated in Australian flags but others have made more of an effort.
The owner of the Camel car, Jimmy Doyle, says it's done six Variety bashes and raised about $130,000. Underneath the fur is a 1985 ZL Fairlane, which "hasn't missed a beat, hasn't even had a flat tyre" on the long journeys.
"You haven't lived till you've been on a Variety Bash, and the week after you don't want to live until your liver sorts itself out," he tells Guardian Australia.
Doyle is also a Variety NT board member and chair of the grants committee. "I get to give the money away which is probably the best second job in the cosmos."

In Queensland there's also quite an extensive rally being held by activists and protesters in support of Indigenous land rights. AAP reports:
A large crowd of Aboriginal activists and supporters has rallied outside Queensland's Parliament House in a protest against Invasion Day.
The crowd gathered outside the entrance of state parliament to express opposition to the celebration of the national day on 26 January, and hear speeches on forced removal of children, racial discrimination and the destruction of traditional lands.
"Always was, always will be, Aboriginal land," they chanted, ahead of a march through the Brisbane CBD en route to Musgrave park.

In the world of sport my colleague Mike Hytner has asked me to remind readers that Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova have just started their Australian Open quarter-final. You can read our live coverage of all things sporting today on this live blog.
Paul Connolly has also written a longer piece on the Australian sporting honours list:
Such are the accomplishments of Australia's best ever male tennis player that if there's any surprise at Rod Laver being appointed a Companion (AC) of the Order of Australia it's that he hadn't already received the honour.
Made a Member of the British Empire in 1970 - a year after he won all four grand slam tournaments in the same calendar year for the second time - Laver, 77, was one of just 10 recipients of the top honour, recognised for his "eminent service to tennis as a player, representative and mentor, at the national and international level, and as a role model for young sportsmen and women".
Born in Rockhampton, Queensland, the left-handed Laver, nicknamed "Rocket", won 11 grand slam singles titles - and contributed to six doubles titles, three mixed doubles titles and five Davis Cup titles - despite being banned from amateur tennis, including grand slam events, between 1963 and 1968 for turning professional. When professionalism was embraced in 1968, Laver added five grand slam singles titles to the six he won before 1963.

In Sydney the Invasion Day march has arrived at Australia House. The march picked up quite impressively as it wound through the city, and there are a lot of great images that have been popping up.

There's also been considerable disquiet about the extent that police are filming the rally. It's now become an increasingly common practice for NSW police to film rallies and protests. In some cases the footage has been subsequently used as evidence in prosecutions, often for offensive language or behaviour when protests become more heated.

The Hottest 100 countdown began with an acknowledgement of country, the first time that's been done in any Triple J broadcast in memory:
As part of our commitment to reconciliation and equality, we believe January 26 should be inclusive, meaningful and respectful to all Australians, so we take this moment to commemorate Australia's First Peoples.
Triple J acknowledges the traditional owners of country throughout Australia and recognises their continuing connection to land, waters and community. We pay our respects to them and their cultures, and to elders both past and present.

Members of the Ahmadi movement of Islam are popping up at Australia Day ceremonies around the country, handing out pamphlets that read "Muslims for loyalty", and carrying out their own flag-hoisting ceremonies at mosques in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide.
enltrThis is Ahmadiyya Muslim Association Australia member Noor Islam. He's handing out #MuslimsForLoyalty pamphlets. pic.twitter.com/2ARniuFj8Y

By way of context, the Ahmadiyya are neither Sunni nor Shia, and in fact are considered heretical by some orthodox Muslims. The movement sprang up around 1889 in what was then British-controlled India, its leader Mirza Ghulam Ahmad proclaiming himself a divine reformer and prophet. That claim is rejected by most Muslims, who consider Muhammad the last prophet, and Ahmadis have faced persecution, both legal and by vigilantes, in places such as Pakistan, Indonesia and Iran.

They have faced no such trouble in Australia where the 3,000-strong community is thriving and has made itself a fixture at events such as Clean Up Australia Day. Ahmadis were also prominent in the aftermath of the 2014 Sydney siege, when they descended on Martin Place in "Muslims for Peace" shirts. 
(Incidentally, the siege gunman, Man Haron Monis, told Australian immigration authorities he had become an Ahmadiyya Muslim in Iran, and consequently feared for his life. He received a refugee visa after making the claim - investigators say it was almost certainly a lie.)

 Malcolm Turnbull: no politician can make Australia a republic  
Malcolm Turnbull says the next push for a republic in Australia must come from a grassroots movement rather than be driven by politicians, or the campaign will end in another "heroic defeat".
The prime minister, an avowed republican, was speaking after hosting an Australia Day citizenship ceremony in Canberra.
The Australian Republican Movement has sought to build momentum by publishing a pro-republic open letter from all premiers and chief ministers (except Western Australia's Colin Barnett). The new Australian of the Year, David Morrison, has also pledged support for constitutional change.
Turnbull said he welcomed the additional voices of support, but said the push for a republic must be shown to be a genuinely popular movement.
"No politician, no prime minister or opposition leader or premier can make Australia a republic. Only the Australian people can do that through a referendum.
There needs to be very strong popular momentum for a change. There has to be a sense that the time is right. There are many more urgent issues confronting Australia, and indeed confronting the government, than the momentum or the desire for Australia to become a republic.
Turnbull said the next referendum should held after the end of the Queen's reign to have the best chance of succeeding.
"To get momentum... it needs to have grassroots support. It is not something that a government can just do, even if it wanted to."

 3, 2, 1... the Hottest 100 gets under way  
Triple J's annual Hottest 100 countdown - for many fans of Powderfinger and Muse, a highlight of the national day - is getting under way across Australia.
In typical millennial fashion (I'm assuming, in typical millennial fashion), plenty of people left it until the last minute to cast their votes, with Triple J reporting a "huge swell of traffic" to its website on Friday before the competition closed.
 Related:  Triple J calls out bookies for betting bonuses on Hottest 100
More than 2m votes were cast by nearly 300,000 voters from 172 countries. "That's HEAPS," said Triple J in a press release, "after spending the weekend crunching numbers."
Here are some of the findings of its stats-a-thon:

2,094,350 votes cast by 298,851 voters from 172 countries
More than 16,000 songs voted for
54% of the songs in the Hottest 100 from Australian artists
26 Hottest 100 debutantes
Average beats per minute 123, compared with 121 in 2014 and 116 in 2013
Triple J also congratulated listeners on the "number of successful troll campaigns... [and] songs disqualified" ("zero") this year, a definitely-not-bitter reference to the #Tay4Hottest100 unpleasantness that marred 2015's competition.
(There were actually tentative moves to get Justin Bieber recognised in the countdown, the legalities of which were discussed at length in this pun- and quotation mark-heavy blog post.)
There are several ways to follow the countdown:
You can turn on your radio, tune into 'Triple J' on your digital radio, stream via the  Triple J website or listen through the Triple J iPhone app  and the  ABC radio Android app. Plus you can  follow us on social media as we update the Hottest 100  songs, give you a look behind the scenes and highlight the best Hottest 100 parties throughout the day on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Spotify and you can find us on Snapchat at triplejsnaps.

"When everyone gets a chance to reach their potential, we as a society can reach our potential," he said in an interview with ABC 24. 
   Australian of the Year David Morrison intends to push for a 'fair go' for everyone.

The electronic music duo of Julian Hamilton and Kim Moyes have proposed shifting the national holiday to an alternate date, such as the birthday of either writer Henry Lawson or Indigenous activist Eddie Mabo.
But not everyone who's engaged with the post has been supportive.
"How dare you insult a day that is about everyone and turn it into a political discussion which has a typical agenda pushed not by indigenous people, but by white do-gooders," said Nathan Sorensen-Salman.

Thus far Australia Day has been marked with plenty of public speeches and pockets of protest. As Michael Safi  has already reported, the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has acknowledged contention over the day in recognising "the oldest continuing cultures on Earth".
"They are the first Australians and we respect and honour them on this, our national day," he said.
As my colleague Monica Tan  wrote in her wrap of Indigenous events being held nationwide, today is for many a timely opportunity to protest against the impacts of colonialism and to express pride in Indigenous culture.

The original hall has been purchased as part of a five-year campaign, and it will be the first time in 78 years that Indigenous Australians have gathered there on 26 January.

The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has just spoken in Canberra. Here's a bit of what he had to say:
Australia is the most successful multicultural society in the world, diverse and harmonious. Our people come from close to 200 countries. For more than 40,000 years, Australia was cared for by the nation's of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Theirs are the oldest continuing cultures on eart h. They are the first Australians and we respect and honour them on this, our national day. So our nation is as old as humanity itself, as old as the rock carvings of the peninsula and the stories of the Dreamtime, told by the first Australians, as old as the Magna Carta, the rule of law and the poetry of Shakespeare, brought by the British settlers, as old as the mysteries of every faith and the riches of every culture, which contributes so much to our diversity.  
Yet, we are as new as the baby who becomes a citizen today in the arms of its migrant parents. We can look at our past with great pride and with some regret but we are not defined, let alone trapped by our history, as many other nations are. Many nations define themselves by a common race or religion or culture. Not us. Our national identity is defined by shared political values, democracy, tempered by the rule of law. A deep belief that each of us owes the other a fair go, the best chance to realise our dreams. And binding us together is mutual respect. We often take that forgranted but we should not. We don't have to look far to seethe consequences of its absence. 
From here he launches into the full Turnbull:
We live in the most exciting time in human history. There has never been such rapid change. Billions lifted out of poverty in a few generations, technology available to many that until recently, even the richest billionaire could not afford. And in this era of transformation, Australia is so well positioned. In a global economy where technology is triumphing over geography, Australians are naturally global citizens.

Not a bad view, via Jessica Mauboy, who sang the national anthem this morning from the top of the Sydney Harbour bridge. 
Here's AAP's take:
Dressed in a bright red dress, Mauboy belted out the national anthem in the Indigenous language before repeating it in English from the blustery heights of the Sydney Harbour Bridge.
Both the Australian and Aboriginal flags were raised together as she sang the anthems at 134 metres above the harbour.
Mauboy's heartfelt delivery sounded out across the harbour just before 8am on a cloudy Tuesday morning.
The Indigenous version was a medley of local Sydney dialects, Australia Day organisers said.

Many Australia Day barbecues around the country will see patchy weather with clouds threatening to make backyard cricket a bit muddy.
For Sydneysiders, the Bureau of Meteorology is forecasting a cloudy day with a maximum of 27C. But more likely than not, there will be a shower or two.
 Melburnians will probably escape any rain ruining their snags, with a sunny day reaching a max of 28C. Although the smell of their barbecues will mingle with the smell of smoke from bushfires.  
 Brisbane will reach similar temperatures but most likley have showers and thunderstorms, while Perth and Adelaide look set to be sunny and reach the low 30s.

An unexpected hit on the eve of Australia Day has been the months-old, but only recently posted video of journalist Stan Grant 's remarks during an IQ2 debate in Sydney, on whether racism was ruining the Australian dream.
Emphatically yes, said Grant, also Guardian Australia's Indigenous Affairs editor.
   Stan Grant at the IQ2 Racism debate  
If you're one of the handful of people left in the country who hasn't seen it, you bloody should. 
Stan has written on the video's success and reflected on the meaning of Australia Day in his latest piece here.
Australia's myths, poetry and anthem tell of a land that can appear unrecognisable to us. We don't share in the 'boundless plains', we have not enjoyed the 'wealth for toil', the sweeping plains and rugged mountains ranges of a sunburnt country were too often places of death for us on the Australian frontier.
Indigenous people die still a decade younger than our fellow Australians, we are 3% of the population yet a quarter of those in prisons. By every measure Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders remain the poorest, most disadvantaged people in Australia and this is no accident. The seeds of our suffering were sown in dispossession at a time when the very humanity of my people was denied.

The Australian of the Year, David Morrison, has also had a speech go viral. Here's his famed June 2013 address - penned by another Australian of the Year nominee, Group Captain Cate McGregor - making it eminently clear what he expects of his troops ("... and if that does not suit you, then get out"). 
Awarded Australian of the Year on Monday night, Morrison said of his remarks: "It's only a fellow, a bloke, saying to his workforce that treating your colleagues with respect is a precondition of your employment. That's all it is."

78% of Australians polled said the day was worth celebrating: to take pride in Australia's culture, values, identity (74%), to hold citizenship ceremonies and other events (60%) and celebrate the patchwork of communities that make up the social fabric (56%).
Around 67 of the 538 people polled said the day wasn't worth celebrating. 65% said it represented loss and injustice towards Indigenous Australians, 35% said it was a lame excuse to get pissed and one-quarter said it lacked any real meaning.

Good morning, it's Australia Day 2016, and we're covering it live all day. Welcome to our coverage.
Much of the chatter this year is about change: the date of our national day, the constitution and the flag - the latter to one of these numbers, put to a vote of more than 8,000 run by a Western Sydney University researcher.
    From left to right, top to bottom: Reconciliation, Sporting, Southern Horizon, Golden Wattle and Southern Cross and Eureka flags. The flags are part of a survey being conducted by Western Sydney University researcher Dr Benjamin T Jones to find out Australian's attitudes to their flag and how they would feel if it was changed. Photograph: Western Sydney University   
More than 60% said they were in favour of switching out the flag, with the most popular design, Southern Horizon in the top right, winning 31% of the vote. 
Already we know the Australian of the Year: Lieutenant General David Morrison, the former chief of army for the Australian defence force and a campaigner for diversity and equality in the armed forces. 
A potential future winner is Senator Jacqui Lambie, who's had a strong start, delivering an Australia Day message urging anyone who doesn't like our "democratic rights" to find another country.
Naturally, she's in a sequinned Australian flag singlet and feather hat plastered in the national ensign. Here's the highlight of her address, which I hope will be an annual fixture:
Remember, if you don't like our democratic rights, liberties and laws, equality for all, including women, gay, and Indigenous people, there are plenty of other countries to choose from.
We'll bring you highlights from events around the country, including updates on the all-important Triple J Hottest 100, and whatever else springs up on this auspicious occasion. 
Much about today is contested, and feels especially so this year. One thing worth celebrating: that it's still possible, at least for one day, for Australians who disagree to sit down together, honour what makes this country special, and write no columns whatsoever.

Who's in the mood for a Hottest 100 controversy? It's been at least five minutes since the last, I'm sure. 
This one comes courtesy of Twitter via the Daily Mail, and features Australian musician Chet Faker who had three songs in last year's top 10, including the number one.
Erin Riley tweeted yesterday, making (imho) a valid point about diversity in the Hottest 100 in a pretty entertaining way.

Hello everyone, Helen Davidson here in Darwin to take you through the next hour or so. Thanks to Calla, and not just for the Chris Hemsworth News Update.
Unfortunately I can't offer you croc related Australia Day activities (an egregious oversight by the NT government and local publicans), but I can give you the next best thing - cockroach races! 
Apparently in Brisbane cockroaches are favoured a little more than they are in Sydney's infested suburbs. 
Owner of the Story Bridge Hotel Richard Deery told the ABC the event - now in its 35th year - was typically Australian.
"It lets everyone become an owner, from the youngest to the oldest. They can all be an owner of a thoroughbred," he said.

In other rather more important news, Tasmania fire service has issued an emergency warning for residents of Perth, in northern Tasmania.
There's an out-of-control bushfire at Drummond Street, just outside the town. Homes in Drummond Street, Cemetery Road, Napoleon Street and Crommwell Street are at "high risk".
More than 70 bushfires have been burning in Tasmania for the past week, and the smoke has made it across the Bass Strait to Melbourne. Conservationists have warned that vegetation loss from the fire is causing the worst crisis Tasmania's world heritage forests have faced in decades.

The title of Tame Impala 's first song in this year's Hottest 100, 'Cause I'm A Man, at #61, works as the perfect segue for a quick post about gender. 
By our count, of the first 40 songs featured in the 2016 poll, 17 feature female vocalists. According to Triple J commentator Patrick Avenell, the record of female vocals featured in the Hottest 100 is 26, so we're more than halfway there (although it's important to remember that when a woman's vocal features on a track, it doesn't necessarily mean she's getting paid for it ).
According to an in-depth piece published by BuzzFeed today, the record of women featuring in the Hottest 100 as vocalists or band members is 34, in 2012. Only three bands featuring female artists have won the Hottest 100 ( The Cranberries, Angus & Julia Stone and Spiderbait ), but no solo female artist has ever won.
And if Triple J trivia is your thing, head to my colleague Nick Evershed 's relentlessly endless Hottest 100 quiz : the perfect barbecue game to play during the snoozy songs.

It wouldn't be Australia Day without a Hemsworth, so here's Chris (that would be Thor, not Hunger Games Hemsworth or the other one) who last week was named global ambassador for Tourism Australia.
The fruits of that union, a three-minute ad with Hemsworthian narration, was launched at an Australia Day do in New York. But Chris Hemsworth 's actual face is not in it because, according to Tourism Australia managing director John O'Sullivan, he's just too gosh-darn handsome and would be a distraction.
I may be paraphrasing a bit. Here's O'Sullivan, from News.com.au :
There's Nothing Like Australia has always been very much about Australia being the hero and telling the country's story.
We felt Chris and his voiceover would provide the perfect complement - an authentic and influential voice to help tell the story.
Hemsworth, who moved to Byron Bay, said he was proud to take on the role:
It's a pretty special feeling knowing that I will have a role in promoting my country to the world and encouraging more people to come down under and experience our amazing beaches and landscapes for themselves.

To Western Australia now, where the first Syrian family settled in Australia after the former prime minister, Tony Abbott, announced in September that Australia would accept 12,000 refugees has apparently enjoyed a barbecue.
The family of five arrived in Perth in November.
According to AAP, Bashar Kujah, his wife Khawlah, and children Mohammad, 8, Maryam, 7, Ahmad, 3, and newborn Abdullah, whose impending birth caused authorities to settle the family earlier than the original arrival date of just after Christmas, attended a community barbecue in Bayswater.
They spoke to reporters through an interpreter. This is from AAP:
They're very happy and they feel that they've come to a great country and they feel among family and friends here." 
Kujah hoped other relatives would eventually be able to come to Australia.
His wife thanked everyone who helped them settle into their Yokine home and said she was so happy her youngest child was born in Australia.
"She's very happy, very pleased that he was born here in Australia so he's now officially an Australian citizen," the interpreter said.
"She's just absolutely thrilled that he had a chance to be born here."

Afternoon all. I'm picking up our live coverage of Australia Day/Survival Day for now. 
Let's start with a very Australian occurrence: Neil Mitchell is angry. Specifically, he is angry about the proliferation of graffiti and signs in the Melbourne CBD declaring today Invasion Day and saying Australia is "celebrating 228 years of genocide".
The talkback radio host objected, saying: "It's nonsense and it's offensive."
You can read more about his objections here, although he doesn't really expand the point.
I've just come from Melbourne's Invasion Day march and while it would have been difficult to hear much objection over the sound of thousands of people chanting "Always was, always will be Aboriginal land," no one much seemed offended.

But for now, I am angry. I see red. My blood boils. And as I head to my favourite beach on my beautiful island home to write this article, a convoy of patriotic tourists flying Australian flags bigger then their windscreens are bogged in the soft sand of Stradbroke Island.

 Summary  
I'm about to hand over our continuing coverage of Australia Day to my colleague Calla Wahlquist. Here's a short summary of how the day is unfolding so far:

Invasion Day protests are taking place across the nation to rally for Indigenous recognition, land rights and equal rights across a range of areas. Major rallies are taking place in Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide.

Former chief of army David Morrison was named Australian of the Year late on Monday evening for his role in the promotion of gender equality in the armed forces.

Prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said the push for a republic is doomed unless it is spurred on by the public.

Eminent women in engineering, philanthropy and sport are among those who have been recognised in the Australia Day honours. Former sex discrimination commissioner Elizabeth Broderick was admitted as an officer of the Order of Australia.

My colleague Calla Wahlquist has been on the ground in Melbourne at the Invasion Day parade. Here's a short dispatch:
Faced with a wall of protesters, the police turned aside. Several hundred people were marching down Melbourne's Bourke Street mall in the name of Invasion Day, and they had reached the barricades set up for the official Australia Day parade. 
The march, which began at Parliament House in Spring Street, now stretched back almost two city blocks. The police line inched back, then stood aside. For the third time in 12 months a protest about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander rights stopped traffic in the Melbourne CBD. Crowds wearing Australian flag tattoos remained on the barricades to watch the new parade go by, to the chant of: "Always was, always will be Aboriginal land." 
Flowers for a memorial were left on the steps of Parliament House and the chant turned to "no pride in genocide". One marcher, who took part in previous Invasion Day marches, said the crowd was twice that of last year. Not everyone was supportive. 
A lone angry white man, resolutely standing at a barricade as the rest of the fence was dismantled around him, punctuated every cry of "Always was, always will be" with "Crap! It's all bullshit, everyone came from somewhere." A slew of police officers sidled up and stood within grabbing distance as the crowd treated him to his own personal chant.
On the other side of the barrier, among a thicket of protest signs, a white man who looked to be in his 90s took a selfie with a young Aboriginal woman." Here," she said, wrapping an Aboriginal flag around his green-and-gold get-up. "Let's cover that up. So will you be marching with us from now on? It's better on this side," she asked. Yes, he agreed. It was.

This would have been a rather grisly discovery for some picnickers in Melbourne. AAP filed this report a short time ago:
A kangaroo has been decapitated and its head left on a barbecue plate at a popular picnic area in Melbourne.
Police say the kangaroo and a skinned rabbit were found at the Diamond creek walking trail picnic site about 8.20am on Tuesday, Australia Day.
When police arrived, they found the head of the kangaroo on a barbecue plate. The body was about 60 metres away, a Victoria police spokeswoman, Leading Sen Const Lee Thomson said.
A witness, Michael, told 3AW he was jogging when he came upon the terrible sight.
"I was just at the jogging track and there's about 10 police here. Kids have put the kangaroo on a public barbecue and have turned it on," he said.
"There's a lot of families here. Police have covered it up in plastic because there's a lot of kids around."

Potentially the biggest Australia Day event in Darwin, the Ute Run attracts hundreds of decked-out vehicles to cruise the streets. A large number of spectators line the streets in camp chairs, ute trays, on picnic rugs, waving as the convoy drives past. It's been run for 14 years and raises money for Variety NT. 
It's hot and sweaty on the race track and there are more stubbie shorts and singlets than you could poke a mullet at.
Most are decorated in Australian flags but others have made more of an effort.
The owner of the Camel car, Jimmy Doyle, says it's done six Variety bashes and raised about $130,000. Underneath the fur is a 1985 ZL Fairlane, which "hasn't missed a beat, hasn't even had a flat tyre" on the long journeys.
"You haven't lived till you've been on a Variety Bash, and the week after you don't want to live until your liver sorts itself out," he tells Guardian Australia.
Doyle is also a Variety NT board member and chair of the grants committee. "I get to give the money away which is probably the best second job in the cosmos."

In the world of sport my colleague Mike Hytner has asked me to remind readers that Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova have just started their Australian Open quarter-final. You can read our live coverage of all things sporting today on this live blog.
Paul Connolly has also written a longer piece on the Australian sporting honours list:
Such are the accomplishments of Australia's best ever male tennis player that if there's any surprise at Rod Laver being appointed a Companion (AC) of the Order of Australia it's that he hadn't already received the honour.
Made a Member of the British Empire in 1970 - a year after he won all four grand slam tournaments in the same calendar year for the second time - Laver, 77, was one of just 10 recipients of the top honour, recognised for his "eminent service to tennis as a player, representative and mentor, at the national and international level, and as a role model for young sportsmen and women".
Born in Rockhampton, Queensland, the left-handed Laver, nicknamed "Rocket", won 11 grand slam singles titles - and contributed to six doubles titles, three mixed doubles titles and five Davis Cup titles - despite being banned from amateur tennis, including grand slam events, between 1963 and 1968 for turning professional. When professionalism was embraced in 1968, Laver added five grand slam singles titles to the six he won before 1963.

In Sydney the Invasion Day march has arrived at Australia House. The march picked up quite impressively as it wound through the city, and there are a lot of great images that have been popping up.
There are some really powerful stories being told by the speakers - here's a selection of a few videos and images.

There's also been considerable disquiet about the extent that police are filming the rally. It's now become an increasingly common practice for NSW police to film rallies and protests. In some cases the footage has been subsequently used as evidence in prosecutions, often for offensive language or behaviour when protests become more heated.

The Hottest 100 countdown began with an acknowledgement of country, the first time that's been done in any Triple J broadcast in memory:
As part of our commitment to reconciliation and equality, we believe January 26 should be inclusive, meaningful and respectful to all Australians, so we take this moment to commemorate Australia's First Peoples.
Triple J acknowledges the traditional owners of country throughout Australia and recognises their continuing connection to land, waters and community. We pay our respects to them and their cultures, and to elders both past and present.

Members of the Ahmadi movement of Islam are popping up at Australia Day ceremonies around the country, handing out pamphlets that read "Muslims for loyalty", and carrying out their own flag-hoisting ceremonies at mosques in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide.

By way of context, the Ahmadiyya are neither Sunni nor Shia, and in fact are considered heretical by some orthodox Muslims. The movement sprang up around 1889 in what was then British-controlled India, its leader Mirza Ghulam Ahmad proclaiming himself a divine reformer and prophet. That claim is rejected by most Muslims, who consider Muhammad the last prophet, and Ahmadis have faced persecution, both legal and by vigilantes, in places such as Pakistan, Indonesia and Iran.

They have faced no such trouble in Australia where the 3,000-strong community is thriving and has made itself a fixture at events such as Clean Up Australia Day. Ahmadis were also prominent in the aftermath of the 2014 Sydney siege, when they descended on Martin Place in "Muslims for Peace" shirts. 
(Incidentally, the siege gunman, Man Haron Monis, told Australian immigration authorities he had become an Ahmadiyya Muslim in Iran, and consequently feared for his life. He received a refugee visa after making the claim - investigators say it was almost certainly a lie.)

 Malcolm Turnbull: no politician can make Australia a republic  
Malcolm Turnbull says the next push for a republic in Australia must come from a grassroots movement rather than be driven by politicians, or the campaign will end in another "heroic defeat".
The prime minister, an avowed republican, was speaking after hosting an Australia Day citizenship ceremony in Canberra.
The Australian Republican Movement has sought to build momentum by publishing a pro-republic open letter from all premiers and chief ministers (except Western Australia's Colin Barnett). The new Australian of the Year, David Morrison, has also pledged support for constitutional change.
Turnbull said he welcomed the additional voices of support, but said the push for a republic must be shown to be a genuinely popular movement.
"No politician, no prime minister or opposition leader or premier can make Australia a republic. Only the Australian people can do that through a referendum.
There needs to be very strong popular momentum for a change. There has to be a sense that the time is right. There are many more urgent issues confronting Australia, and indeed confronting the government, than the momentum or the desire for Australia to become a republic.
Turnbull said the next referendum should held after the end of the Queen's reign to have the best chance of succeeding.
"To get momentum... it needs to have grassroots support. It is not something that a government can just do, even if it wanted to."

 3, 2, 1... the Hottest 100 gets under way  
Triple J's annual Hottest 100 countdown - for many fans of Powderfinger and Muse, a highlight of the national day - is getting under way across Australia.
In typical millennial fashion (I'm assuming, in typical millennial fashion), plenty of people left it until the last minute to cast their votes, with Triple J reporting a "huge swell of traffic" to its website on Friday before the competition closed.
 Related:  Triple J calls out bookies for betting bonuses on Hottest 100
More than 2m votes were cast by nearly 300,000 voters from 172 countries. "That's HEAPS," said Triple J in a press release, "after spending the weekend crunching numbers."
Here are some of the findings of its stats-a-thon:

2,094,350 votes cast by 298,851 voters from 172 countries
More than 16,000 songs voted for
54% of the songs in the Hottest 100 from Australian artists
26 Hottest 100 debutantes
Average beats per minute 123, compared with 121 in 2014 and 116 in 2013
Triple J also congratulated listeners on the "number of successful troll campaigns... [and] songs disqualified" ("zero") this year, a definitely-not-bitter reference to the #Tay4Hottest100 unpleasantness that marred 2015's competition.
(There were actually tentative moves to get Justin Bieber recognised in the countdown, the legalities of which were discussed at length in this pun- and quotation mark-heavy blog post.)
There are several ways to follow the countdown:
You can turn on your radio, tune into 'Triple J' on your digital radio, stream via the  Triple J website or listen through the Triple J iPhone app  and the  ABC radio Android app. Plus you can  follow us on social media as we update the Hottest 100  songs, give you a look behind the scenes and highlight the best Hottest 100 parties throughout the day on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Spotify and you can find us on Snapchat at triplejsnaps.

The 2016 Australian of the Year, David Morrison, has spoken out about religious discrimination faced by the Islamic community in Australia, one day after receiving the top honour.
"When everyone gets a chance to reach their potential, we as a society can reach our potential," he said in an interview with ABC 24. 
   Australian of the Year David Morrison intends to push for a 'fair go' for everyone.  
Morrison's profile rose in 2013 after his video address to serving ADF members after the 'Skype scandal', in which he lambasted those who turned a blind eye to sexism, harassment and abuse of women in the force.

The electronic music duo of Julian Hamilton and Kim Moyes have proposed shifting the national holiday to an alternate date, such as the birthday of either writer Henry Lawson or Indigenous activist Eddie Mabo.
But not everyone who's engaged with the post has been supportive.
"How dare you insult a day that is about everyone and turn it into a political discussion which has a typical agenda pushed not by indigenous people, but by white do-gooders," said Nathan Sorensen-Salman.
"Australia Day is totally about inclusion of everyone and is a celebration - not a commiseration."

Thus far Australia Day has been marked with plenty of public speeches and pockets of protest. As Michael Safi  has already reported, the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has acknowledged contention over the day in recognising "the oldest continuing cultures on Earth".
"They are the first Australians and we respect and honour them on this, our national day," he said.
As my colleague Monica Tan  wrote in her wrap of Indigenous events being held nationwide, today is for many a timely opportunity to protest against the impacts of colonialism and to express pride in Indigenous culture.

The original hall has been purchased as part of a five-year campaign, and it will be the first time in 78 years that Indigenous Australians have gathered there on 26 January.

The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has just spoken in Canberra. Here's a bit of what he had to say:
Australia is the most successful multicultural society in the world, diverse and harmonious. Our people come from close to 200 countries. For more than 40,000 years, Australia was cared for by the nation's of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Theirs are the oldest continuing cultures on eart h. They are the first Australians and we respect and honour them on this, our national day. So our nation is as old as humanity itself, as old as the rock carvings of the peninsula and the stories of the Dreamtime, told by the first Australians, as old as the Magna Carta, the rule of law and the poetry of Shakespeare, brought by the British settlers, as old as the mysteries of every faith and the riches of every culture, which contributes so much to our diversity.  
Yet, we are as new as the baby who becomes a citizen today in the arms of its migrant parents. We can look at our past with great pride and with some regret but we are not defined, let alone trapped by our history, as many other nations are. Many nations define themselves by a common race or religion or culture. Not us. Our national identity is defined by shared political values, democracy, tempered by the rule of law. A deep belief that each of us owes the other a fair go, the best chance to realise our dreams. And binding us together is mutual respect. We often take that forgranted but we should not. We don't have to look far to seethe consequences of its absence. 
From here he launches into the full Turnbull:
We live in the most exciting time in human history. There has never been such rapid change. Billions lifted out of poverty in a few generations, technology available to many that until recently, even the richest billionaire could not afford. And in this era of transformation, Australia is so well positioned. In a global economy where technology is triumphing over geography, Australians are naturally global citizens.

Not a bad view, via Jessica Mauboy, who sang the national anthem this morning from the top of the Sydney Harbour bridge. 
Here's AAP's take:
Dressed in a bright red dress, Mauboy belted out the national anthem in the Indigenous language before repeating it in English from the blustery heights of the Sydney Harbour Bridge.
Both the Australian and Aboriginal flags were raised together as she sang the anthems at 134 metres above the harbour.
Mauboy's heartfelt delivery sounded out across the harbour just before 8am on a cloudy Tuesday morning.
The Indigenous version was a medley of local Sydney dialects, Australia Day organisers said.

For Sydneysiders, the Bureau of Meteorology is forecasting a cloudy day with a maximum of 27C. But more likely than not, there will be a shower or two.
 Melburnians will probably escape any rain ruining their snags, with a sunny day reaching a max of 28C. Although the smell of their barbecues will mingle with the smell of smoke from bushfires.

An unexpected hit on the eve of Australia Day has been the months-old, but only recently posted video of journalist Stan Grant 's remarks during an IQ2 debate in Sydney, on whether racism was ruining the Australian dream.
Emphatically yes, said Grant, also Guardian Australia's Indigenous Affairs editor.

If you're one of the handful of people left in the country who hasn't seen it, you bloody should. 
Stan has written on the video's success and reflected on the meaning of Australia Day in his latest piece here.
Australia's myths, poetry and anthem tell of a land that can appear unrecognisable to us. We don't share in the 'boundless plains', we have not enjoyed the 'wealth for toil', the sweeping plains and rugged mountains ranges of a sunburnt country were too often places of death for us on the Australian frontier.
Indigenous people die still a decade younger than our fellow Australians, we are 3% of the population yet a quarter of those in prisons. By every measure Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders remain the poorest, most disadvantaged people in Australia and this is no accident. The seeds of our suffering were sown in dispossession at a time when the very humanity of my people was denied.

A potential future winner is Senator Jacqui Lambie, who's had a strong start, delivering an Australia Day message urging anyone who doesn't like our "democratic rights" to find another country.
Naturally, she's in a sequinned Australian flag singlet and feather hat plastered in the national ensign. Here's the highlight of her address, which I hope will be an annual fixture:

Spike in mental health patient deaths shows NHS 'struggling to cope'; 
MP Norman Lamb likens rise of over 20% in the unexpected deaths of mentally ill people in NHS care to Mid Staffs scandal and calls for investigation.

Denis Campbell Health policy editor.

A sudden spike in the number of mental health patients dying unexpectedly in NHS care has prompted calls for a wide-ranging investigation into "threadbare" services that are "struggling to cope".
New NHS figures show that the number of deaths annually among mental health patients in England has risen 21% over the last three years from 1,412 to 1,713. 
 Related:  'I didn't matter': the long wait for mental health treatment 
The number of those killing themselves or trying to do so has also increased, by 26% from 595 in 2012-13 to 751 in 2014-15. It covers both those being treated as inpatients for serious mental health problems and also those who are being cared for while still living at home. 
Figures obtained by Norman Lamb, the Liberal Democrat MP, show that the overall number of "serious incidents" - involving unexpected or avoidable deaths, serious harm, injury and abuse - has climbed 34% to 8,139 a year. They have become so common that one trust, North East London foundation trust, had a total of 633 last year - almost two a day. 
Lamb, the mental health minister in the coalition until last May, made the comparison with the Mid Staffordshire scandal in which hundreds of patients died as a result of poor care over a four-year period.
 Related:  Tackling mental illness early: the people being taught to spot warning signs
"Significant numbers of unexpected deaths at the Mid Staffs NHS trust caused an outcry and these figures should cause the same because they show a dramatic increase in the number of people losing their lives," Lamb said.
"NHS England and the government should set up an investigation into the causes of this as these figures involve tragedies for families around the country and the human impact is intense." 
Underfunding of sometimes threadbare mental health services which are struggling to cope with rising demand for care is to blame, Lamb claimed. 
The way the NHS collects such figures has changed since 2014-15. But figures for the first six months of 2015-16 show a continued upward trend, with 1,132 serious incidents recorded as involving an unexpected or potentially avoidable death. 
Paul Farmer, chief executive of the charity Mind and also the chair of NHS England's mental health taskforce, said that even if better reporting partly explained the rises, "the figures give us real cause for concern".
 Membership Event:  Guardian Live | How do we pay for NHS we want?
"We know, for example, that suicides among people in touch with crisis resolution and home treatment teams - which are there to support people in crisis to stay in their own homes rather than be admitted to hospital - have increased significantly. 
"These teams have in recent years been starved of funding and in some cases have been disbanded altogether or else merged into community teams, losing their specialist function, at a time of rising demand," Farmer added. 
Every unexpected death should be investigated so that lessons can be learned to prevent future loss of life, he urged. 
But Prof Sir Simon Wessely, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said the apparent dramatic increases were due primarily to staff and trusts reporting more such events when they happen. 
By almost every metric, the number of people with mental health problems in the UK has surged in recent years, leaving NHS services simply unable to deal with the volumes. The numbers of people in contact with mental health services has jumped by more than 40% over the past decade, while the number of antidepressant prescriptions have surged by more than 100% in the same period.
But the government has been accused of cutting millions of pounds from mental health funding. An attempt to concentrate efforts on talking therapies by increasing the numbers of psychotherapists has produced mixed results. 
Many long-term patients describe a byzantine system of long waiting times, lack of psychiatrists, overreliance on pills as an easy solution and a sense of limbo for all but the most severe cases. 
Matters have not been helped by the fact that limited staffing numbers have fallen even further in recent years. The number of specialist mental health nurses has fallen more than 10% over the past five years, the Guardian has learned.
The loss of one in 10 of the entire mental health nursing workforce in England has occurred mainly in hospitals and mental health units treating some of the sickest patients, official NHS figures show.
Figures from the NHS's health and social care information centre, obtained through a parliamentary question, show that the number of qualified nurses working in psychiatry dropped by 10.8% from 41,320 in 2010 to 36,870 in 2015.
 Related:  Number of mental health nurses falls 10%
While the number working in community psychiatry services has fallen only slightly from 15,986 to 15,826, those listed as working in "other psychiatry" - mainly hospital units - went down from 25,334 to 21,044.
"These shocking figures raise serious concerns about the future of our mental health services," said Luciana Berger,the shadow minister for mental health. "At a time when there is growing demand and staff are being asked to do more for less, cuts to the number of nurses working in mental health are completely unacceptable."
NHS England declined to comment directly on Lamb's figures. A spokeswoman said: "Reporting of incidents is intentionally up right across the NHS, including mental health, as part of our national effort to encourage transparency and a culture of learning.
"That's the lesson from the airlines - openness is a precondition for safety and improvement. That's as true for mental health services as it is for maternity care or surgical operations."

Cameron too close to Google, say critics, after £130m tax deal; 
Vince Cable, Rupert Murdoch and Margaret Hodge among figures to speak out as questions grow over government links with senior company executives.

Rowena Mason and Rajeev Syal.

David Cameron has been accused of getting too close to Google amid growing anger over the government's £130m tax deal, which has been criticised for being too lenient towards the tech giant. 
Former cabinet minister Vince Cable, media mogul Rupert Murdoch and former chair of the Commons public accounts committee Margaret Hodge all voiced concerns on Wednesday that Cameron and George Osborne had allowed the tech giant to hold too much sway.
Cable, the Lib Dem former business secretary, said Google had a "great deal of influence" in No 10 under the coalition and that Google's billionaire executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, in particular enjoyed good links with Downing Street. 
He said that "very close relationship probably made it very difficult for HMRC to be aggressive in its tax settlement with the company". 
Cable also said the UK's decision to announce a tax deal unilaterally "undermines the effort to deal with this internationally", including the reported attempts by France and Italy to extract higher levels of back taxes from Google.
Downing Street said Cameron and Osborne had nothing to do with the agreement struck by HM Revenue & Customs last week to force Google to hand over £130m in underpaid taxes.
                     Murdoch accused the "posh boys in Downing Street" of being in awe of Google. The multibillionaire executive chairman of News Corp, who controls the Times and the Sun, sent a series of tweets on Wednesday suggesting Downing Street was too close to Google and accusing the company of "paying token amounts for PR purposes".
"Google has cleverly planted dozens of their people in White House, Downing St, other governments. Most brilliant new lobbying effort yet," he wrote.
He made the pronouncements despite facing accusations during the phone-hacking scandal that he and his executives were too close to senior politicians in the UK and had too much lobbying power. Murdoch, a long-time critic of Google, has also seen his company tax affairs come under scrutiny in Australia.
Hodge said Google had purposely targeted all political parties in the company's efforts to win influence in Westminster. "They are very, very clever at building their political links. If I am absolutely honest, they had as strong links with Labour. But their executives realise that these things really do matter, even when negotiating tax deals," she told the Guardian.
 MPs on Wednesday raised concerns about extensive links between No 10 and Google executives, including Cameron's appointment of   Schmidt to his exclusive business advisory board until July last year. 
Cameron is also a personal friend of Rachel Whetstone, a former Tory aide who was Google's PR chief until last year and is married to Cameron's former chief strategist Steve Hilton. There is another link through Tim Chatwin, who moved straight from being Cameron's head of strategic communications to a role as senior director of communications at Google in 2012.
Lady Joanna Shields, who was ennobled by Cameron last year and made internet security minister, is a former managing director at Google as well as many other tech companies.
Downing Street could not say whether Cameron had ever discussed Google's tax affairs with any company executives and insisted most of the tech firm's 25 meetings with ministers were about issues such as internet security. It also claimed that Cameron and Osborne were unaware of the deal until shortly before Google announced it and the chancellor hailed it as a "major success".
HMRC is still refusing to say how the £130m was calculated, whether it includes any fines or interest, and what effective rate of tax Google has ended up paying - citing taxpayer confidentiality. 
But Jeremy Corbyn said experts thought it amounted to an effective rate of about 3%, in contrast to rates of corporation tax of above 20% over the last decade.
The Labour leader pointed out that most people did not have the luxury of personal meetings to discuss their tax affairs. "Millions of people are this week filling in their tax returns to get them in by 31 January," he said. "They have to send the form back. They do not get the option of 25 meetings with 17 ministers to decide what their rate of tax is.
"Many people going to their HMRC offices or returning the [form] online this week will say this: 'Why is there one rule for big multinational companies and another for ordinary small businesses and self-employed workers?'"
This exchange at prime minister's questions forced Cameron into defending the deal, saying it was better than Labour's failure to collect any back taxes from Google at all. The prime minister said he was "genuinely angry" about HMRC's failures under Labour and insisted it was wrong to say that Google was only paying a 3% rate of tax.
However, there were few in the Tory party willing to stand up vocally for the deal, with no one willing to repeat Osborne's claim on Friday that it was a victory. Anna Soubry, a business minister, inflamed criticism of the government by telling the BBC's World at One: "It doesn't sound like an awful lot of money, of course it doesn't. It would be silly to say otherwise. But if it is within the rules..."
Caroline Flint, a member of the Commons public accounts committee, called for Cameron to look at asking companies to publish their tax returns, which was rebuffed by the government. She also said Cameron and other ministers should disclose whether tax was discussed in their meetings with Google.
"It's fair for us to ask, if ministers and advisers have been having meetings with Google, for them to explain what those meetings are about," she said.
Eva Joly, a French MEP and vice-chair of the European parliament's special committee on tax rulings, said she wanted Osborne to answer questions about the "very bad deal".
A Google spokesman said: "After a six-year audit by the tax authority we are paying the amount of tax that HMRC agrees we should pay. Governments make tax law, the tax authorities enforce the law and Google complies with the law."
Peter Barron, Google's head of communications and public affairs, publicly defended the deal for the first time, saying criticism had not taken into account how international tax law works.
He wrote a letter to the FT, saying: "After a six-year audit we are paying the full amount of tax that HM Revenue & Customs agrees we should pay, including £130m in additional back tax. Governments make tax law, the tax authorities independently enforce the law, and Google complies with the law."

David Cameron has become the master of trickle-down hate; 
A bunch of migrants? Really? The prime minister once lamented broken Britain, but his words about those stuck in Calais show he now seeks to divide it.

Joseph Harker.

During the last election David Cameron made great headway with his slogan about Labour and the SNP wanting to "break up Britain". It's been a theme with him. As leader of the opposition, Cameron declared Britain "broken" under Labour, and said he was the one to fix it. It's ironic, then, that few people in the past decade have done more to break apart the bonds that hold Britain together than the Tory party leader.
 Related:  Murdoch criticises Cameron for being too easily swayed by Google - Politics live 
Responding at Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions to Jeremy Corbyn's visit to the refugee camp at Calais last weekend, Cameron joked: " They met with a bunch of migrants in Calais. They said they could all come to Britain. " Corbyn had travelled to Calais to witness for himself the appalling conditions endured by those at the camp, by people who have already fled war or extreme poverty, and survived treacherous journeys across Europe and the Mediterranean. Britain and France need to be "a bit more human about this", Corbyn said.
But Cameron was not interested in their humanity - lumping them, their stories and their suffering into a "bunch", mere fodder for his jokes. On the day he commemorated Holocaust Memorial Day one couldn't help but wonder whether, if Cameron had been around in the 1930s, he would have laughed about "a bunch of Jews".
It was remarkable, even though we already knew Cameron's views on migration: last year he called those trying to gain entry to Britain a "swarm of people" - another attempt to dehumanise. And in response to the refugee crisis across Europe, and the public horror over the death of two-year-old Alan Kurdi, he approved only a miserly 4,000 entries per year.
Muslims seem a particular target of his divisive and alienating language
Muslims seem a particular target of his divisive and alienating language. Today's comments come a week after Cameron's ill-judged threats to deport female Muslim migrants if they don't master the English language, and on the day his chief schools inspector warned that schools may be failed if they allow girls to wear face veils. "This will have the effect of alienating many staff and pupils," said an NUT spokesman. Andrew Clapham, an expert on school inspection, said: "There is no credible evidence base to suggest that wearing a piece of clothing on one's head has an impact on intellectual or academic ability." But already the damage has been done: an issue that affects a tiny fraction of Muslim girls, has become headline news. Indeed, BBC Radio 5 Live chose it as their main phone-in debate today, creating the impression that it's a large-scale problem.
At a meeting of the Policy Exchange thinktank on Monday, the PM's "integration tsar" Louise Casey blamed multicultural Britain, and political correctness, for the abuse of women - as if abuse never happened in the UK before Muslims arrived. Or maybe she believes, like Cameron does, that Muslim women are "traditionally submissive".
The national press, as ever, is keen to fuel these stories: Casey was given a column in the Sun based on her speech; and the Times ran a news report quoting Trevor Phillips' comments at the same Policy Exchange meeting, headlined: "Muslims are not like us, race equality chief says". In fact, most of what Phillips said was commendable: "Part of the integration process is for the rest of us to grasp that people aren't going to change their views simply because we are constantly telling them that basically they should be like us." The headline writers instead chose more divisive words.

Cameron's dog-whistles matter. They may appear to be mere words - jokes or slips of the tongue; but they set the parameters and the tone of the debate. We could call this trickle-down hate. So if he makes a bold statement about the niqab, or some other aspect of multicultural Britain, it will go to the top of the news agenda, even if it's in actual fact insignificant or completely wrong - as in the so-called Trojan Horse scandal in Birmingham schools, which a parliamentary committee inquiry ruled to be groundless.
When, last year, two black passengers in separate incidents launched into a tirade of abuse against Muslims travelling on a bus, it was not just their race and the ferocity of the attacks that was alarming, but the fact they could recite so many Islamophobic tropes - from grooming, to terrorism, to FGM, to forced marriage. All important issues, of course, but all had been reported as if they undermine Islam itself and its billion followers, rather than being stories of individual wrongdoing.
And today we saw another consequence of this, with a rise in hate crimes on British railways - up 37% in five years. This confirms a trend seen last year, when there was a 43% increase in religious hate crime, and a 15% rise in race hate over the previous 12 months.
Cameron speaks; his entourage pushes further; the media responds; and on the streets, the abuse and attacks kick off. Sadly, Cameron and the Tories seem to believe that the answer to a broken nation is to break it some more.

The Big Shortfall: how UK taxpayers are cheated by business lobbyists; 
We have a chancellor who can describe as a 'major success' just £130m in back taxes paid by Google. It has to be one of the biggest sweetheart deals of all time.

Simon Jenkins.

What's wrong with big business all of a sudden? The latest revelations of malpractice at Tesco, Sports Directand Volkswagen are now capped by Google's grand larceny of British taxpayers. There is of course "no wrongdoing", that motto of modern business. But Google executives are behaving like medieval penitents, wandering Europe's confessionals to buy remission of fiscal sins for as little as they can get away with. The idea that the internet would herald a new, clean-limbed, egalitarian corporatism is dead.
 Related:  Google tax deal was purely HMRC decision, Downing Street stresses 
Some sacred compact between capitalism's producers, consumers, shareholders and regulators appears to have snapped. If it's legal, goes the cry, then it must be moral. If it's greed, it's good. Only fools get caught and, if caught, they just apologise and go on as before. There is no policeman, no court.
It is not just multinationals. The once noble sports of football, athletics and tennis are now mired in corruption allegations. Privatisation has brought the incentives, and the ethics, of big business to public service. The NHS is a cooperative of purchaser/provider rackets. Electricity prices are revealed each month as a conspiracy against the poor. The Hinkley Point nuclear power deal is close to meltdown.
Common themes run through these scandals. One is the huge sums available to their participants, an incentive to misdemeanour. A sign of guilt is the speed with which press disclosure leads to remorse, as at Volkswagen and Tesco. Another is the vulnerability of state regulators and ministers to pressure. Political lobbying in Britain has blossomed under David Cameron, for the simple reason that it works. Cameron once promised to curb it, but it proved its worth by lobbying for its own survival and winning. The industry now raises an annual £2bn in fees.
Tesco could persecute its suppliers with impunity because it was powerful, a bully and unregulated. Agency staff could be underpaid by Sports Direct, keeping one step ahead of its unions and the law. Volkswagen appeared to have no clue that its bureaucracy contained nerds out to cheat pollution inspectors. As for Britain's tax authorities, they could win a role in the Keystone Cops.
When the tech giants of Silicon Valley enter their offices, they take on the immorality of the herd
The American management guru Peter Drucker used to present the modern firm as an ethical construct, bringing the community goods and services in return for taxed profits. What was good for General Motors was good for America. That held for half a century. But even Drucker warned against untrammelled monopoly and the "economic rent" it offered those who could manipulate it.
What Drucker failed to take on board was the message of his fellow American, the philosopher Reinhold Niebuhr. He was fascinated by the contrast he saw between interwar Germans' behaviour as decent individuals and their appalling behaviour as a group. It was the difference between "moral man and immoral society".
I assume the directors of Tesco and Volkswagen were shocked to discover what was being done in their name. I am sure the tech giants of Silicon Valley tell their children they should always pay their taxes. Yet when they enter their offices, they take on the immorality of the herd. They are ethically neutered - as depicted in the current film The Big Short.
When communism collapsed across Europe and Asia it did not, of course, collapse. It never existed. It operated as a covert barter economy run by a network of local mafias. Collapse legitimised these mafias but did not police them. They became thieves. The robber barons of 19th-century America became the oligarchs of today's Russia.
We thought contact with western capitalism would make honest businessmen of Russian oligarchs. The reverse appears to be the case. Contact with oligarchs has turned western capitalists into dodgy businessmen. Big corporations have developed morally impermeable skins. They outsource their dirty work to subcontractors, consultants and lobbyists.
The most sinister aspect of the scandals has been the ease with which government is wound round the little fingers of these corporations. Since 2009 the big banks have hurled lobbyists at the Treasury to ward off any retribution (or even inquiry) after the banking collapse, and to maintain their freedom to do the same again. They still pay out billions for mis-sold insurance. Tesco had been bullying farmers for years. On energy prices, hardly a month passes without the regulator, Ofgem, slamming firms for overcharging, while the companies laugh all the way to the bank. When, as with the benighted Financial Conduct Authority, a regulator tries to say boo to the City goose, the chancellor obediently sacks its chairman.
Britain now parades the world with a Treasury, a tax authority and a chancellor who can describe as a "major success" just £130m in back taxes paid by Google on an estimated UK turnover of £6bn. It has to be one of the biggest sweetheart deals of all time.

At present the only real expression of public outrage is through the unsteady columns of the press. Governments, parliaments, regulators and ombudsmen occasionally wail and gnash their teeth. But in the cases cited it was often media investigation, aided by whistleblowers, that brought malpractice to light and forced government action.
Throughout its history, capitalism has stumbled through regulatory evolution. Limited liability, bankruptcy and competition law have had to be constantly updated. So have protocols on governance, pricing, pay and the handling of customers and suppliers. The discipline of the market is never enough.
Britain's Treasury should have no interest in appeasing international corporations for the sake of a few thousand jobs in the City. It should be collecting taxes. The irony of the Google deal is that, in most respects, London is already a tax haven, a refuge for the world's money-laundering, tax-evading classes. It is also responsible for the most ludicrous offshore havens, such as Bermuda, the Caymans and the Virgin Islands. It is their accomplice in stripping the treasuries of the world of trillions of dollars a year.
The best argument for Britain staying in the EU is to help formulate some supranational authority to police global capitalism and tax its profits. The trouble is that Britain, in this respect, is one of the worst offenders.

BHA funding scheme faces big test after Rich Ricci joins BetBright; 
∑ Authority will be keen for Authorised Betting Partner plan boost ∑ Owner has string of short-priced runners at Cheltenham Festival.

Greg Wood.

The British Horseracing Authority's Authorised Betting Partner scheme faces another test of its credentials this weekend following the news Rich Ricci, one of National Hunt's leading owners and the lynchpin of the Willie Mullins stable in Ireland, is the new chairman of the internet bookmaker BetBright.
 Related:  Bookmakers warned to pay up or face being barred from sponsorship 
Formal confirmation of Ricci's move into the betting industry is expected before the BetBright Trial Chase at Cheltenham on Saturday, for which the owner's seven-year-old Djakadam is expected to start the odds-on favourite.
Djakadam is also the 7-2 favourite for the Cheltenham Gold Cup, while Ricci's outstanding team of horses for the Festival meeting includes four favourites on the opening day. Douvan, Faugheen and Annie Power are odds-on for the Arkle Trophy, Champion Hurdle and Mares' Hurdle respectively, while Min, their stable companion at the Mullins yard, is 13-8 for the meeting's first race, the Supreme Novice Hurdle. Other star names expected to represent Ricci at Cheltenham include Vautour, already a winner at the meeting for the last two seasons.
BetBright sponsors the feature race at Cheltenham on Saturday as part of a three-year deal that also includes a race at the course on New Year's Day and the BetBright Cup, a secondary competition at the Festival based on the friendly rivalry between British and Irish stables.
Ricci will announce the team "captains" for this year's event at a press conference at Cheltenham on Saturday morning but may also face questions about BetBright's willingness to join the ABP scheme, which requires offshore bookmakers to agree to pass a percentage of their gross profits on British racing back to the sport. To date, only three betting companies - Betfair, Bet365 and 32red.com - have signed up for the scheme.
Jockey Club Racecourses, which owns Cheltenham, has stated it will not sign sponsorship deals, or renew existing deals, with non-ABP betting firms, a stance that has already resulted in BetFred's replacement by Timico as the sponsor of the Gold Cup. Ladbrokes' long-standing association with the World Hurdle is also under serious threat as a result of the firm's refusal to agree ABP status.
BetBright's deal at Cheltenham concludes at the end of next season but it will still be a blow to the credibility of the ABP campaign if a company which has appointed such a high-profile owner as its chairman refuses to sign up. It will also cast a sharp light on comments by Mullins before last year's Festival, when he suggested the prize money on offer at the Festival was "not fair and not on", and should be "at least doubled, if not more" to reflect the sums owners such as Ricci pay for young jumping stock.
 Related:  Offshore initiative could help racing and betting sort out old differences
The BHA said on Wednesday it had "written to all bookmakers, including BetBright," with details of the ABP scheme and that "the process of speaking to the betting industry to outline the benefits of becoming an Authorised Betting Partner is ongoing."
"At the moment we sponsor some fantastic races at Cheltenham, Doncaster and Kempton," Brian Farrell, BetBright's marketing director, said, "and will consider our options once these sponsorships come to an end. For now, we are focusing on working hard to make our sponsorships as successful as possible and engage with real racing fans. We do have a desire to continue to use race sponsorships as part of our brand building and marketing strategy."
Ricci had three winners at last year's Festival but the fall of his runner Annie Power in the Mares' Hurdle on the opening day was estimated to have saved the bookmaking industry many millions of pounds, as the mare would have completed many thousands of Yankees and other accumulator bets on four hot favourites from the Mullins stable.
Some punters may feel uneasy about the chairman of a bookmaker having such a close interest in horses that could do significant damage to the betting industry's profits in March. Others may wonder whether BetBright will lay all requested bets on Ricci's horses in full at advertised prices or, as is often the case with online operators, either restrict stakes or refuse bets altogether.
British racing has a long history of bookmakers owning horses, however. William Hill and Victor Chandler among those to have owned major winners. More recently, Michael Tabor, the former owner of the Arthur Prince betting shop chain and now leading member of the powerful Coolmore ownership syndicate on the Flat, bought Chandler's company BetVictor.
The BHA's rules on laying by owners state that it is an offence for any owner "to lay any horse he owns with a Betting Organisation to lose a race, instruct another person to do so on his behalf or receive the whole or part of any proceeds of such a lay." Only last week, owner Alan Findlay was banned from racing eight years for laying his own horses on Betfair.
However, the rules also make it clear that "nothing in this rule prevents the laying of any horse owned by a Betting Organisation in the ordinary course of that Betting Organisation's business".
Ricci, who has invested many millions of pounds in National Hunt racing, lives in Britain but stables his horses exclusively with Mullins in County Carlow. He was a high-profile figure in banking and finance, and was one of a number of senior executives to leave Barclays' investment arm in the wake of the Libor rate-fixing scandal which engulfed the bank in the summer of 2012.

Powerful Google tax opponent will urge UK to drop hostility to radical EU change; 
Multinationals would file single European tax return under plan proposed by EU tax commissioner to stamp out aggressive avoidance.

Simon Bowers.

One of the most powerful opponents of Google 's controversial tax structures, European tax commissioner Pierre Moscovici, is expected on Thursday to call on Britain and Ireland to drop their objections to radical tax reform across the EU.
Moscovici, who has previously advocated a Europe-wide "digital tax" on companies such as Google, now wants to tackle aggressive tax avoidance among multinationals by requiring them to file a single European tax return. 
 Related:  Cameron defends Google tax deal in Commons clash with Corbyn 
He believes this reform - known as the common consolidated corporate tax base (CCCTB) - would remove the temptation for international firms to artificially divert income from one country to another. Member states, would still be free to set their own corporate tax rates.
Britain, however, is among a small band of countries fiercely opposed to the European commission's plans, believing they would weaken the UK's ability to tailor its tax system to attract jobs and investment from international businesses.
 "The CCCTB [proposal] has been around a very long time," Treasury minister David Gauke said last year. "It is a proposal still looking for a justification."
Moscovici is due to give an update on other corporate tax reforms in Brussels on Thurday morning, but is expected to use the occasion to insist his CCCTB reforms are far from dead in the water - despite British opposition. 
The former French finance minister has a long track record of challenging the tax affairs of internet companies - and Google in particular. Two years ago, he led calls for the G20 to create dedicated tax rules for digital companies, though his efforts were ultimately blocked by American pressure. He has also previously advocated a Europe-wide "digital tax" on internet companies that make money from consumers' personal data.
France has consistently taken a tougher approach to aggressive tax planning by Google and other digital companies. In 2011, tax inspectors raided the search group's Paris offices, and ever since have been challenging Google's claims that its French sales can be legitimately booked in Ireland. French tax officials are said to be seeking £380m in back taxes.

Google is next week expected to reveal that its controversial tax structures have boosted its offshore cash reserves to $43bn - up $4bn in 12 months. 
Overnight on Tuesday, fellow US tech group Apple, which also uses controversial tax structures to pay less tax in Europe, revealed its offshore cash pile has now reached $200bn - largely held through companies in Ireland. Chief executive Tim Cook boasted Apple now had "the mother of all balance sheets".
Earlier this month, Moscovici told MEPs that he wanted to make 2016 "the year of tax reform", with CCCTB at the centre of his plans. "We have a serious problem with tax avoidance and lack of transparency. Too many people have looked the other way", Moscovici said.
Since unveiling his reforms last summer, the European tax commissioner has been barraged with lobbying submissions. The majority have come from business trade bodies, law firms and multinationals, many based in the UK, Ireland and the Netherlands.
But Moscovici insists widespread anger among voters at a string of tax scandals will play a vital role in winning round reluctant governments, often subject to lobbying from big business. He has described CCCTB as part of a [global] trend, drawing support from the pressure of public opinion.
Britain, meanwhile, has attempted to tackle Google's tax avoidance in its own way. Chancellor George Osborne last year introduced a new tax on diverted profits, having promised to put a stop to technology companies such as Google going to what he called " extraordinary lengths to pay little or no tax" in the UK. Of those who used such structures, he said: "you abuse the trust of the British people".
But last week his crackdown pledge was left in tatters after Google confirmed it had struck a deal with HMRC that effectively allowed it to continue to route £4.6bn of UK sales via an Irish company that pays no tax in Britain. Google's UK arm - which paid £21m in tax according to its latest accounts - will only be required to pay slightly more to HMRC under the settlement.
Critics have branded it a sweetheart deal, pointing out that the £130m in back taxes, which relates to a 10-year period, is tiny in comparison with the sums mounting up in Google's coffers in Bermuda. 
George Osborne has been vocal in supporting some initiatives on international tax reform, but has confused many tax experts by also slashing the UK tax rate - due to fall to 18% by 2020 - and introducing controversial tax breaks to attract multinationals to invest in Britain.
Google last year stalled its plans for a big new London headquarters in King's Cross, London, insisting, according to reports, that the design proposals for a building - complete with a rooftop pool - to house 5,000 workers were "boring". A new architect has since been hired, and fresh plans are now expected.
In 2011, Google increased its workforce in France by half and invested heavily in a new Paris head office near the Saint-Lazare train station amid public anger about its tax payments. One French senator accused the group of running its local business as a  " charity ".

Murdoch lambasts Downing Street over 'easy' Google tax deal; 
Media mogul, whose own tax affairs came under scrutiny in Australia, says 'posh boy' politicians were too awed by tech giant.

Rowena Mason Political correspondent.

Rupert Murdoch has accused the "posh boys in Downing Street" of being too easily awed by Google as the government came under fire over its £130m tax deal with the technology giant.
Murdoch, the multibillionaire executive chairman of News Corp who ultimately controls the Times and the Sun newspapers, sent a series of tweets on Wednesday suggesting Downing Street was too close to Google and accusing the company of "paying token amounts for PR purposes".
He made the pronouncements after facing accusations during the phone-hacking scandal that he and his executives were too close to senior politicians in the UK and had too much lobbying power. Murdoch's company tax affairs have also come under scrutiny in Australia 
He made the comments amid intense scrutiny of Downing Street's links with Google, as HM Revenue and Customers was accused of settling for too little.
Labour has said it believes Google is paying an effective rate of just 3%. This figure is disputed by Cameron but HMRC will not disclose what rate it has settled for.
At prime minister's questions, Cameron defended the deal, saying it was better for the government to accept £130m than nothing collected under Labour.
He was forced to stick up for HMRC, after Jeremy Corbyn accused the government of having one rule for multinational corporations and another for ordinary individual taxpayers.
 Related:  No results found, Dave? The Google search for fair taxes goes on
After it emerged that ministers and officials had met Google officials numerous times in recent years, Corbyn said most people do not have the luxury of personal meetings to discuss their tax affairs.
"Millions of people are this week filling in their tax returns to get them in by 31 January," he said. "They have to send the form back, they do not get the option of 25 meetings with 17 ministers to decide what their rate of tax is.
"Many people going to their HMRC offices or returning the [form] online this week will say this: 'Why is there one rule for big multinational companies and another for ordinary, small businesses and self-employed workers?'" 
Following the Commons clash, Corbyn's spokesman said: "It's quite clear that the majority of Britain feels that this is a bad deal for the taxpayer. Not only does there need to be proper tax paid by corporations, but there needs to be openness and transparency, which is what Jeremy is calling for."
He said the Labour leader was considering publishing his own tax returns to put extra pressure on the prime minister to do the same. Cameron has previously said he would be "extremely relaxed" about disclosing his tax arrangements but has not yet done so.

An investigation into Google was launched in 2009 under Labour, and it has taken the last six years to reach a settlement.
This is the first time Cameron has had to defend the deal since it was announced by George Osborne as a "major success" on Friday.
Downing Street had refused to repeat that celebratory language, merely referring to it as a good deal and insisting that HMRC was solely in charge of striking the agreement.
It has been under particular pressure since it emerged that both France and Italy are demanding much higher amounts from Google, despite the company having bigger sales operations in the UK.
The prime minister is also facing growing calls to scrap taxpayer confidentiality for companies, meaning they would be forced to publish details about their tax affairs.
Caroline Flint, a Labour MP and former cabinet minister, called for all corporate tax affairs to be made public.

Sport's Qatar-funded crusaders find Westminster and leave fans behind; 
The International Centre for Sports Security is on its journey towards credibility so why not turn to Richard Keys?.

Marina Hyde.

Another week, another chance to wonder whether those loudly vowing to clean up sport in our name are really the uncompromised crusaders of their own mythology.
To the Palace of Westminster, then, and a thrilling mention in dispatches for our up-and-coming friend the International Centre for Sports Security. Do you remember this "sports integrity" outfit, touched upon in this space last week ? Set up to push for greater transparency in the bidding processes for major events and to safeguard nothing less than the integrity of sport, its savagely self-satirising punchline is that it is literally funded by the government of Qatar, which seems like it really wants to get to the bottom of why it hosted more than 40 international events last year, is condemned by any number of human rights organisations for the staggering death toll among migrant and indentured workers building the infrastructure for such things, and was the beneficiary of a bidding process that saw it awarded the 2022 World Cup but which is currently under investigation by both t he FBI and Swiss prosecutors.
Meanwhile, in a development unlikely to send casual observers into shock, it was claimed on Tuesday that Doha's bids for the 2017 and 2019 world championships have now been referred to the IAAF ethics commission. 
The ICSS gets really pissy if you mention the local connection, though. "The Qatar government has nothing to do with it at all," the organisation's president Mohammed Hanzab recently snapped. "It is true that it is 70% funded by the Qatar government" - perhaps that accounts for people's confusion - "and 30% is funded through projects we run... I have said to many people: 'If you can secure me the 70% from other governments, from other foundations, then I will be happy, as I will be a free man and I will not face this question wherever I go.'"

I do hope that no one was unmannerly enough to bring it up on Monday night, because that was a big staging post on the ICSS's comic caper of a journey towards credibility. Its work was commended at a private event hosted by ICSS lobbyists in the Speaker's state rooms at the House of Commons. Singing its praises was none other than New Fifa Now co-founder Damian Collins. "There has never been a time when debate and scrutiny of the governance of sport has been greater than it is today," Mr Collins declared. "I commend the ICSS's work in taking a lead and promoting good governance and sport integrity worldwide."
Is that what it is up to? It certainly seems to have a constant stream of new initiatives. Last summer ICSS lobbyists were in Washington pushing one called Financial Integrity and Transparency in Sport. Now they're in Westminster punting the Sport Integrity Global Alliance. I trust the Random Initiative Title Generator will throw out something like a Transparent World Alliance for Truth in Sport (TWATS) in time for spring.
On this occasion, the reception was obligingly staged by the Speaker to ink an agreement between the Commonwealth Games Foundation and the ICSS, which will apparently now "independently audit the CGF's governance model". As for who will independently audit the ICSS's governance model, that is unclear. I move for some kind of supra-supra body headed up by Doha's Richard Keys.
I can't imagine where the money swilling round these type of ventures would lead if you followed it. One thing we have to go on is the invitation to the event, a copy of which I have seen, which comprises a nebulous call to arms to "the industry, including the sports bodies, sponsors, media, governments, international authorities, NGOs and other key stakeholders".
Oof. Hands down, that's my favourite definition of the tribes that make up modern sport, reading like a Who's Who of people who couldn't really give a toss about it except as far as it aligns with their own interests.

Anyone who thinks that sport is truly about the athletes and the fans will note that these irrelevances are the only two "stakeholders" absolutely nowhere to be seen, and unlikely ever to get a look-in. Yet the need for them to drive an actual stake through the heart of this deathless industry has never seemed more pressing, as the latest party in a seemingly eternal parade of suits arrives to profit from the failings of the last set.

Champagne moment for Keys and Gray
Speaking of Richard Keys, he alerts the world to an important commemorative date. "Happy anniversary Andy," he tweets this week, with reference to his broadcasting buddy Andy Gray. "5 years after one of the biggest carve ups in TV history."
Maybe even in the whole of history. "I had to have a glass tonight!' concludes Richard, above a picture of the pair clinking champagne glasses in an airport Caviar House.
A Caviar House - but of course. I confess to finding Caviar Houses a perennial sources of fascination when in a terminal. Their patrons always seem to be people somehow emboldened by "the airport experience" to act like their fantasy version of themselves - which turns out to be someone who'd pay through the nose to drink champagne on a leatherette bar stool, their back grandly turned on the people browsing universal adaptors a few feet behind them. In the airport of the world, I suspect Doha is the Caviar House, and we should congratulate Keysy on this most poignant of metaphors.
